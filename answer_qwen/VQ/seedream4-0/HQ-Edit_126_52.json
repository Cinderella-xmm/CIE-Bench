      "question": "Are the crystal shards aligned with the cactus ribs and uniformly distributed without gaps or overlapping clusters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal shards are visually positioned along the ridges (ribs) of the cactus, following their natural vertical segmentation. Each rib appears to have a consistent number of crystals placed at regular intervals, suggesting uniform distribution. The crystals are sharply defined and do not overlap with one another; instead, they are spaced evenly, creating a symmetrical pattern that enhances the cactus’s structure. There are no visible gaps between adjacent crystals on the same rib, nor are there clusters where multiple crystals merge or appear compressed. This alignment and spacing reflect intentional design, likely inspired by aesthetic symmetry and geometric harmony. Given the clarity and precision of placement, it is reasonable to conclude that the crystals are both aligned with the ribs and uniformly distributed.",

      "question": "Do the luminous glyphs follow the rib lines of the cactus and emit a soft glow without causing overexposure or halo effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminous glyphs in Image B are clearly etched along the vertical ribs of the cactus, conforming precisely to the natural grooves of its segmented structure. Their glowing appearance is consistent with an internal light source, as they emit a soft, neon-like green illumination that enhances visibility without overwhelming the surrounding areas. There is no evidence of overexposure—such as blown-out highlights or white halos around the glyphs—which would suggest excessive brightness. Instead, the glow is contained and diffused subtly, integrating well with the cactus’s surface texture. This controlled luminescence indicates careful digital rendering to maintain visual balance and realism within a fantastical context.",

      "question": "Is the sandstone pedestal fully grounded on the wooden surface with natural texture and no floating or clipped edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandstone pedestal in Image B rests directly on the wooden surface, showing full contact along its base. The shadow beneath the pedestal is continuous and naturally shaped, indicating physical grounding rather than floating. The texture of the stone is detailed, with visible grain and erosion patterns typical of weathered sandstone. At the edge where the pedestal meets the wood, there are no sharp clipping artifacts or unnatural breaks in continuity. Instead, the transition is smooth, and the subtle interaction of light and shadow reinforces the impression of solidity and stability. Additionally, small vines and flowers extend from the base into the surrounding area, further anchoring the pedestal to the scene. These elements collectively support the conclusion that the pedestal is fully grounded and seamlessly integrated into the environment.",

      "question": "Are the amber eyes embedded within the cactus ribs at symmetrical positions and do they show internal illumination without distorting the surrounding tissue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The amber-colored 'eyes' in Image B are embedded at regular intervals along the cactus ribs, appearing symmetrically placed across the structure. There are four visible eyes, each located approximately at the midpoint of a rib segment, contributing to balanced visual composition. The internal illumination of these eyes is evident through a warm, glowing effect that suggests light emanating from within, yet the surrounding cactus tissue remains intact and undistorted. The skin of the cactus does not bulge or warp around the eyes, preserving the natural curvature and structural integrity of the plant. This careful integration implies a high level of digital artistry aimed at blending fantasy elements with realistic biological forms. Therefore, both symmetry and anatomical coherence are maintained.",

      "question": "Do the vine tendrils curve naturally around the pedestal and connect smoothly to the base without floating or rigid positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vine tendrils in Image B exhibit organic curvature as they wrap around the sandstone pedestal, following natural growth patterns seen in climbing plants. They originate from the base of the cactus and extend downward and outward, forming gentle loops and spirals that adhere to the contours of the pedestal. The connection points between the vines and the base are seamless, with no abrupt cuts or floating segments. Small flowers and leaves are interspersed along the vines, enhancing the sense of living growth. Shadows cast by the vines align with the lighting direction, reinforcing their three-dimensional presence and attachment to the surface. There is no indication of rigidity or artificial placement; instead, the vines appear dynamically integrated into the scene. This combination of form, shadow, and botanical detail supports the conclusion that the tendrils are naturally curved and smoothly connected.",
