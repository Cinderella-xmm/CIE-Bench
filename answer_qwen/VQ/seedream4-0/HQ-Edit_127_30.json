      "question": "Does the transformed violin body maintain consistent surface texture and lighting behavior with a high-quality engraved case, without unnatural sheen or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin is placed inside an open case that appears to be of high quality, with rich red velvet lining and gold hardware. The violin's body exhibits a polished wooden finish with visible grain patterns and subtle reflections consistent with natural wood under studio lighting. The lighting on the violin shows soft highlights and shadows that follow the curvature of its body, indicating realistic rendering of surface properties. There is no evidence of excessive glossiness or unnatural sheen that would suggest digital over-processing. The interaction between light and surface texture aligns well with expectations for a finely crafted instrument housed in a premium case. The case itself has a smooth, matte exterior with metallic accents that reflect light appropriately without harsh glare. The overall visual coherence suggests that the violin’s surface texture and lighting behavior are consistent with a high-quality setup, with no apparent texture mismatches.",

      "question": "Are the gold accents on the chinrest and tailpiece seamlessly integrated with no visible seams, unnatural reflections, or color bleeding into adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the chinrest and tailpiece of the violin feature gold-colored hardware. These components appear to be made of metal, as indicated by their reflective properties and polished surfaces. The gold elements are positioned at the expected locations—on the chinrest and near the tailpiece—and show uniform coloration without visible seams or irregularities. The reflections on these parts are consistent with ambient lighting and do not exhibit overly sharp or artificial glares that would suggest digital manipulation. There is no noticeable color bleeding into the surrounding wood or black fittings, which indicates careful attention to material boundaries. The integration of the gold accents appears seamless and physically plausible, adhering to real-world standards for violin craftsmanship.",

      "question": "Is the scripted font along the strings clearly legible, aligned with string curvature, and free from distortion or floating effects that suggest digital overlay errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'I Plato Dauryn' is inscribed along the upper bout of the violin, just above the f-holes, and appears to be part of the instrument's body rather than a separate label. The script follows the gentle curve of the violin’s body and is positioned parallel to the strings. It is rendered in a cursive, elegant style typical of artisanal instruments. The font is clear and legible, with consistent stroke thickness and spacing. There is no blurring, pixelation, or floating effect that would indicate it was digitally overlaid post-production. The text blends naturally with the wood grain and lighting, showing appropriate shadowing and depth. This suggests that either the text is physically engraved or realistically simulated within the image, without signs of digital artifacts.",

      "question": "Does the newly designed pedestal stand have proportionally correct legs and decorative elements that match the vintage aesthetic without appearing undersized, misaligned, or structurally unstable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pedestal stand in Image B supports the violin case and features ornate carvings and curved legs characteristic of classical furniture design. The legs are splayed outward for stability and terminate in scrolled feet, which is typical of Baroque or Rococo-inspired styles. The proportions of the stand are balanced: the height is sufficient to elevate the case to eye level, and the base width provides adequate support. Decorative elements such as floral motifs and carved details are symmetrically placed and proportionate to the overall structure. There are no signs of structural imbalance, such as uneven leg angles or disproportionate thickness. The material appears to be dark wood, consistent with vintage aesthetics, and the finish reflects light uniformly, suggesting a cohesive design. The stand appears both functional and stylistically appropriate, matching the elegance of the violin and case.",

      "question": "Are the key structural components of the violin—such as the f-holes, bridge, and scroll—still present in accurate positions and proportions relative to each other, even after modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin retains all essential structural components: two symmetrical f-holes located on either side of the bridge, a properly shaped bridge supporting the strings, and a detailed scroll at the top of the neck. The f-holes are correctly positioned and shaped, following traditional violin design. The bridge stands upright and is centered between the f-holes, maintaining proper string tension alignment. The scroll is intricately carved and proportionally sized relative to the rest of the neck. All these elements are spatially coherent and maintain anatomical accuracy typical of a standard violin. While the violin may have been stylized or enhanced (e.g., with custom engraving), there is no indication of deformation, misalignment, or scaling errors. Therefore, despite any artistic modifications, the core anatomy remains intact and accurately represented.",
