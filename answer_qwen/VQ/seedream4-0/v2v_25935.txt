    "Question": "Q1: Do the Lego bricks representing the cobblestone path maintain a natural appearance without introducing obvious unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cobblestone path is constructed from Lego bricks that are arranged in a pattern mimicking real cobblestones. However, the texture of the surface is clearly artificial due to the uniformity and repetitive circular studs typical of Lego pieces. Real cobblestones vary in shape, size, and wear, contributing to a more organic and irregular surface. In contrast, the Lego version lacks this variation and instead presents a highly structured and repetitive pattern. While the arrangement attempts to simulate a cobblestone street, the presence of consistent stud patterns introduces an unmistakable artificial texture. This deviation from natural stone surfaces makes the representation visibly unnatural upon close inspection.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the Lego brick structures of the buildings coherent and visually credible, without any broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "The buildings in Image B are constructed using standard Lego bricks and display clean, geometric forms with consistent alignment. The walls, windows, arches, and doorways are all built with precise brickwork that follows logical architectural principles. There are no visible gaps, misaligned pieces, or broken shapes that would compromise structural coherence. Even details like window frames and arched entrances are formed using appropriate Lego elements, maintaining visual credibility. Although the style is stylized and simplified compared to real-world architecture, the construction remains internally consistent and free of defects. Therefore, the buildings appear coherent and believable within the context of a Lego diorama.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the man's figure in the Lego diorama retain proper proportions and physical rationality, avoiding unnatural body shapes?",
    "explanation": "The man in Image B is a standard Lego minifigure, which has exaggerated proportions typical of such toys—large head relative to body, short limbs, and blocky torso. These proportions are not anatomically accurate but are intentional design choices for toy figures. From a realistic human perspective, the figure does not reflect natural body proportions or physical rationality. However, within the context of a Lego diorama, these proportions are expected and consistent with the medium. The figure maintains structural integrity and symmetry, and there are no distorted or malformed parts. Thus, while it lacks realism, it adheres to the established design norms of Lego figures, making it physically rational within its own context.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Have the fine details of the man's clothing and accessories been preserved in the Lego diorama without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man’s clothing consists of a blue shirt and black pants made from solid-colored Lego pieces, which lack the fine textural details present in real fabric, such as stitching, folds, or material sheen. The cap is also a simple black piece with minimal detail. The briefcase is a brown Lego accessory with basic buckles and straps, but it lacks the nuanced leather texture, stitching, and depth seen in real-world counterparts. While the overall shape and form of the clothing and accessories are recognizable, the fine details are significantly simplified or absent. There are no visible artifacts like warping or glitches, but the simplification itself constitutes a loss of detail rather than an introduction of errors. Therefore, the preservation of fine details is limited by the nature of Lego construction.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the hand holding the briefcase in the Lego diorama appear natural with correct ergonomics, lines, and texture?",
    "explanation": "The hand in Image B is a standard Lego minifigure hand, characterized by a yellow, curved, and segmented design with no fingers. It grips the handle of the briefcase in a way that is functional within the Lego system but not anatomically accurate. Real hands have complex joint structures, skin texture, and grip mechanics that are entirely absent here. The hand lacks natural contours, wrinkles, or muscle definition, and the grip appears stiff and mechanical. Additionally, the texture is smooth plastic, lacking the softness and variability of human skin. While the pose is plausible for a Lego figure, it fails to meet ergonomic or aesthetic standards for natural human anatomy. Thus, the hand does not appear natural or ergonomically correct.",
    "answer": "No"
