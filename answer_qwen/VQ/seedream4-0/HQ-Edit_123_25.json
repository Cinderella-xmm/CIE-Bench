      "question": "Are the floral and scroll motifs on the back of the dress clearly defined with smooth edges and no visible pixelation or broken lines after the paper-cut effect is applied?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the postcard in the top-left corner shows a cropped version of the original image (Image A), focusing on the back of the dress. The floral and scroll motifs are rendered with clean, sharp lines and appear to have smooth edges consistent with high-resolution digital art. There is no visible pixelation or jaggedness, suggesting that the rendering quality is high. The 'paper-cut effect' here refers to the way the image is presented as if clipped from a physical source—however, this does not affect the clarity of the embroidery design itself. Since the motif appears crisp and continuous without breaks or artifacts, it indicates that the digital reproduction maintains fidelity to the original design. Therefore, based on visual inspection and common standards for digital image quality, the motifs are well-defined.",

      "question": "Does the blue gradient overlay on the dress transition smoothly without creating abrupt color boundaries or altering the underlying texture of the fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue gradient on the dress in the top-left postcard appears uniform and blends seamlessly across the fabric. There are no visible hard edges or banding effects that would suggest abrupt transitions. The underlying texture of the fabric, including the embroidered patterns, remains intact and legible beneath the gradient, indicating that the overlay was applied in a way that respects the original material’s appearance. This suggests a professional-grade digital editing technique where transparency and blending modes were used appropriately. No distortion or flattening of texture is evident, so the gradient enhances rather than obscures the fabric details.",

      "question": "Is the silver tone of the hair accessory uniform and reflective in a way that matches the lighting direction and does not show unnatural highlights or dark patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hair accessory in the top-right postcard is depicted as a metallic silver leaf-shaped pin. Its surface exhibits subtle gradients and reflections consistent with polished metal under diffuse lighting. The highlights follow a logical path along the contours of the leaf, suggesting directional lighting from the upper left, which aligns with the overall scene illumination in the original image. There are no sudden dark spots or over-bright specular reflections that would imply poor rendering. The tonal consistency and realistic sheen suggest careful attention to material properties and lighting simulation, resulting in a natural-looking metallic finish.",

      "question": "Do the bamboo patterns in the third postcard align correctly with the background bamboo stalks and maintain consistent spacing and perspective without overlapping or floating anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom-right postcard features an embroidered bamboo pattern. Upon close examination, the bamboo stalks are arranged vertically with appropriate spacing and tapering consistent with real bamboo growth. The leaves extend naturally from the nodes, and there is no evidence of misalignment, floating elements, or overlapping that would disrupt depth perception. The perspective is flat but coherent within the two-dimensional context of the embroidery, which is typical for such designs. The green tones vary slightly to simulate shading, enhancing realism without introducing visual errors. Thus, the composition adheres to botanical accuracy and design principles for textile art.",

      "question": "Does the silk-bound book have a consistent material texture, proper thickness, and clean edges that match the appearance of a real physical object without stretching or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom-left postcard displays a silk-bound book with an embroidered floral design. The surface has a satin-like sheen and fine texture indicative of silk fabric. The edges of the book are straight and well-defined, with no signs of distortion or warping. The thickness appears plausible for a bound book, with a visible spine and slight curvature at the corners, suggesting physical volume. The stitching detail on the cover is precise and evenly spaced, contributing to the authenticity of the object. There is no stretching or unnatural elongation, and the reflection of light on the surface supports the idea of a smooth, taut fabric covering. Overall, the representation is realistic and faithful to a real-world silk-bound book.",

      "question": "Are the three postcards positioned within the book layout with equal margins and no partial cropping or overlap that would disrupt the visual presentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the four items are arranged in a 2x2 grid on a white background, resembling a curated display. However, the question refers to 'the three postcards positioned within the book layout.' But upon inspection, all four images are displayed independently in separate frames; there is no actual book layout containing them. The bottom-left item is a silk-bound book, but it is not acting as a container for the other cards. Instead, each card is presented as a standalone piece. Therefore, the concept of 'positioned within the book layout' does not apply—there is no enclosing book structure. As such, the condition about equal margins and non-overlapping cannot be evaluated under the intended premise. The arrangement is symmetrical and balanced, but since the cards are not inside a book, the assumption in the question is invalid.",
