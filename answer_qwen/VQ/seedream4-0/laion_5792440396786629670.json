    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the castle icon used for the HOMEPAGE positioned centrally and sized proportionally to fit within the original white rounded rectangle area without overlapping nearby elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle icon is positioned to the left of the HOMEPAGE label and does not appear to be centrally aligned within the white rounded rectangle area. It also seems larger than the original space intended for text, overlapping nearby elements such as the connection lines. The analysis is based on observing the placement and size of the castle icon relative to its surrounding elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the connection lines between the HOMEPAGE and main sections (e.g., PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS, ABOUT US) transformed into smooth, winding trails with no broken segments or irregular widths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The connection lines in Image B have been transformed into smooth, winding trails that connect the HOMEPAGE to the main sections. There are no broken segments or irregular widths visible along these trails. This conclusion is drawn by examining the continuity and uniformity of the trails throughout the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the icon replacing \"PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS\" clearly visible, properly aligned within the orange rounded rectangle, and appropriately scaled so it doesn't extend beyond the border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no specific icon replacing the 'PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS' text in Image B. Instead, the text remains as it was in Image A. Therefore, there is nothing to assess regarding visibility, alignment, or scaling of an icon in this context.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the decorative elements (e.g., trees, creatures) placed along the winding trails in gaps between nodes and do they have smooth outlines and consistent coloring without jagged edges or noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decorative elements like trees and creatures in Image B are placed along the winding trails in gaps between nodes. They have smooth outlines and consistent coloring without jagged edges or noise. This assessment is made by closely inspecting the edges and color transitions of these elements.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the text in the blue rounded rectangles (e.g., \"News\", \"Events\") use a consistent, bold, child-friendly font that remains fully contained within the bounds of each shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in the blue rounded rectangles (e.g., 'News', 'Events') uses a consistent, bold font that appears child-friendly. The text is fully contained within the bounds of each shape, with no overflow or distortion. This conclusion is reached by evaluating the font style and the positioning of the text within the shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the different levels of the site map (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th) still visually separable based on color coding or size differences, despite the change in style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the change in style, the different levels of the site map in Image B remain visually separable based on color coding. Each level has a distinct color, making it easy to differentiate between them. This analysis is conducted by comparing the colors used for each level and noting their differences.",
