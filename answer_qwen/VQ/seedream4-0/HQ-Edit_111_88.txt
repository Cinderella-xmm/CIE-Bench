    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's raised leg and arm appear to maintain natural human proportions and joint alignment. The stylized design does not introduce geometric distortion or unnatural bending. The leg is bent at a plausible knee angle, and the arm is extended in a manner consistent with human anatomy. The joints and limbs are proportionate relative to the body, suggesting careful attention to realistic human form despite the artistic style.",
