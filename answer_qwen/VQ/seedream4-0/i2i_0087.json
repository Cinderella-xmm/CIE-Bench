      "question": "Are the shadows under and around the protruding clock consistent with its new 3D effect without creating artificial or inconsistent lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock appears to be rendered with a 3D effect, giving it depth as if it protrudes from the wall. The shadow beneath the clock is elongated and casts diagonally toward the bottom-right, suggesting a light source from the top-left. This directional shadow is consistent with typical lighting in such scenes and matches the perceived depth of the clock. The shadow has soft edges and subtle gradient variation, which contributes to a natural appearance rather than an abrupt or artificial look. Additionally, the shadow's shape follows the circular form of the clock, reinforcing the 3D illusion without introducing inconsistencies. There are no visible artifacts like double shadows or mismatched angles that would suggest poor lighting modeling. Based on common principles of 3D rendering and lighting, the shadowing appears plausible and well-integrated.",

      "question": "Does the circular shape of the clock remain undistorted and geometrically sound after being altered to appear as if it protrudes from the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock in Image B maintains a perfect circular outline, with no visible warping, stretching, or distortion. Even though it appears to have depth, the outer edge remains uniformly round, indicating that the 3D effect was applied without altering the fundamental geometry. The perspective suggests a slight extrusion from the wall, but there is no foreshortening or asymmetry that would imply distortion. In real-world 3D modeling, a circular object protruding from a surface should retain its shape unless viewed at an extreme angle — which is not the case here. The symmetry and uniformity of the circle confirm that the shape remains geometrically accurate despite the added depth.",

      "question": "Have the textures and fine details on the clock face been preserved, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or pixelation as a result of making it appear 3D?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock face in Image B shows a smooth, clean white surface with no visible texture noise, pixelation, or blurring. The hands (hour, minute, and second) are sharp and clearly defined, with crisp edges and consistent coloration. The red center dot and black hands are rendered without jagged lines or aliasing, which could occur during digital manipulation. There are no signs of compression artifacts or resampling errors that often accompany image editing involving depth effects. The surface of the clock face appears uniformly matte, consistent with high-resolution rendering. Since the original design is minimalist and lacks intricate patterns, the absence of visible artifacts supports the conclusion that the 3D effect was applied cleanly, preserving detail integrity.",

      "question": "Do the clock's hands and markings retain their original clarity, style, and proportion, contributing to a natural and credible appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock hands in Image B are clearly visible and maintain their original proportions: the hour hand is shorter and thicker, the minute hand longer and thinner, and the second hand is thin and red. All three hands are aligned correctly relative to each other, suggesting accurate time representation (approximately 10:05). Their shapes are consistent with modern minimalist clock designs. There is no distortion, blurring, or misalignment due to the 3D effect. The lack of any visual interference from the depth manipulation ensures that the hands appear natural and functional. The central pivot point is also well-defined, maintaining structural coherence. Given that these elements are critical for readability and aesthetic consistency, their preservation enhances the overall credibility of the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the edited clock appear to naturally integrate into the wall with a realistic thickness and depth, maintaining visual plausibility within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock in Image B exhibits a convincing sense of depth through subtle shading and a cast shadow that suggests it is slightly raised from the wall. The thickness appears consistent with a standard wall clock, and the transition from the clock’s edge to the wall is smooth, without abrupt changes in tone or texture. The shadow’s length and softness indicate a reasonable distance from the wall, consistent with a moderately thick clock face. The lighting direction and intensity are coherent across the entire scene, supporting the illusion of depth without breaking realism. There is no floating or disjointed appearance; instead, the clock seems firmly mounted, with the 3D effect enhancing rather than disrupting the scene’s plausibility. Real-world expectations for wall clocks align with this presentation, where slight protrusion is normal and visually acceptable.",
