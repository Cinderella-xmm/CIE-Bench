      "question": "Are the outlines around each rose petal uniform, continuous, and free of pixelation or irregular breaks that would indicate an unnatural transition from organic form to mosaic pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rose petals are rendered as mosaic elements composed of small, distinct tiles. Each petal is outlined by a thin border of contrasting colored tiles (often dark or greenish), which separates it from adjacent petals and background elements. These borders are consistent in thickness and follow the contours of the petals closely. However, upon close inspection, the transitions between tiles are not perfectly smooth—there are slight irregularities and breaks in continuity at the edges, particularly where multiple petals meet or overlap. These breaks suggest that the mosaic rendering process did not fully preserve the natural flow of the original organic shapes. Additionally, some areas show jagged edges typical of digital mosaic generation, indicating artificial segmentation rather than a seamless artistic integration. This suggests the outlines are not entirely uniform or continuous, and there are visible signs of pixelation or artificial breaks. In contrast, in Image A, the rose petals have soft, organic edges with no such defined borders, reflecting their natural form. The comparison highlights that the mosaic conversion introduced structural discontinuities not present in the original.",

      "question": "Do the petals exhibit smooth transitions between light and dark areas consistent with pearl-like reflectivity, and do the leaves show subtle jade-like translucency without visible texture distortion or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The petals in Image B are composed of individual mosaic tiles, each with a glossy, reflective surface resembling mother-of-pearl. While the overall appearance mimics a pearlescent sheen, the transitions between light and dark areas are not smooth but instead occur in discrete steps due to the segmented nature of the tiles. Light appears to be reflected uniformly across tile faces, creating a shiny, almost plastic-like effect rather than the soft gradient seen in real pearls. Furthermore, the 'translucency' of the leaves is simulated using lighter green tiles with subtle gradations, but this lacks the depth and natural variation found in real jade-like translucency. Instead, the leaves appear flat and stylized, with sharp boundaries and minimal internal detail. Compared to Image A, where petals display soft gradients and realistic lighting effects, and leaves show fine venation and natural color variation, Image B's representation is more decorative than lifelike. The mosaic technique sacrifices subtlety for visual impact, resulting in an unnatural sheen and lack of true translucency.",

      "question": "Are the architectural features like the arched window and corner pilasters preserved in shape and proportion despite being converted into terracotta-colored tiles, and do they align seamlessly with adjacent mosaic sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building’s architectural elements—including the arched window and corner pilasters—are rendered in a mosaic style using terracotta-colored tiles. The shapes of these features remain largely intact: the arch retains its curved profile, and the pilasters maintain their vertical alignment and rectangular form. Proportions appear consistent with those in Image A, suggesting careful preservation of structural geometry during the transformation. The tiling follows the contours of the architecture, and transitions between different sections (e.g., from wall to window frame) are generally smooth and aligned. There is no visible warping or distortion that would suggest misalignment. However, minor discrepancies can be observed at the edges where mosaic patterns shift, especially near the window’s keystone and along the pilaster joints. These are likely due to the tessellation process, but they do not significantly disrupt the overall coherence. Given that the goal was stylistic reinterpretation rather than photorealism, the preservation of shape and proportion is commendable. Compared to Image A, where these elements are solid brick with clear mortar lines, the mosaic version successfully abstracts while maintaining fidelity to the original structure.",

      "question": "Does the mosaic rose bush maintain correct spatial placement relative to the building behind it, with no floating or misplaced elements suggesting incorrect depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rose bush is depicted as a mosaic overlay on the foreground, with the building in the background also rendered in mosaic form. Despite both elements being stylized, their spatial relationship remains consistent with the original scene. The roses appear to grow from the base of the image and extend upward, partially obscuring parts of the building, just as they do in Image A. The perspective is maintained: the lower branches are closer to the viewer, and upper ones recede appropriately. There are no instances of roses appearing to float above the building without support or intersecting walls in a way that violates depth logic. The mosaic technique does not distort the layering; instead, it applies the same style uniformly across both foreground and background, preserving relative depth. While the transition between plant and architecture is stylized, the overall composition respects the original spatial hierarchy. Thus, the depth perception remains accurate even after the transformation.",

      "question": "Are the fine details such as petal layers, leaf venation, and brick joints preserved in a stylized yet coherent manner, without appearing smeared, distorted, or replaced by flat, featureless surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, fine details are reinterpreted through the mosaic medium. Petal layers are suggested by overlapping tile arrangements, with varying shades of white and pink used to imply depth and curvature. While not anatomically precise, the layering is coherent and recognizable as floral form. Leaf venation is approximated using darker green tiles arranged in branching patterns, which mimic veins but are simplified compared to the natural detail in Image A. Brick joints are represented by gaps between tiles of different hues, forming a grid-like pattern that preserves the general layout of the original masonry. However, the individual bricks lose their texture and three-dimensionality, becoming flat, uniform rectangles. Some areas, particularly where petals overlap, show slight smearing or blending of colors due to tile edges, which may reduce clarity. Yet, overall, the details are not erased but transformed into a stylized, coherent visual language. The mosaic technique replaces realism with artistic abstraction, but maintains enough structural integrity to retain recognizability. Therefore, while not photorealistic, the details are preserved in a meaningful, non-distorted way.",
