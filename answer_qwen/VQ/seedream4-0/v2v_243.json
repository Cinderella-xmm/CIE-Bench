      "question": "Do the transformed skis and hockey sticks maintain their original structural integrity and proportions as footwear, avoiding any unnatural distortions or breaks in geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skis have been transformed into a pair of boots that are mounted on the ski bases. The skis themselves appear to retain their elongated, narrow shape, but they are now functioning as the sole and lower structure of the boots. However, the transformation introduces significant geometric distortions: the upper parts of the boots (the foot and ankle sections) are disproportionately large compared to the ski base, and the transition from ski to boot is abrupt and lacks anatomical plausibility. The curvature of the ski does not naturally extend into a realistic boot shape, and the overall form appears forced. Additionally, the hockey sticks remain unchanged and lie in the snow, but they are not integrated into the footwear design. This suggests that while the skis serve as a base, the transformation into footwear violates natural structural proportions. Based on world knowledge, ski boots are designed with specific ergonomic shapes for feet and ankles, which these do not resemble. Thus, the transformation results in unnatural geometry.",

      "question": "Are the vivid patterns and wooden textures from the original skis and hockey sticks naturally incorporated into the footwear design without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original skis in Image A feature vibrant, psychedelic patterns with flowing waves and geometric designs. In Image B, these same patterns are visible on the surface of the transformed skis, which now function as the base of the boots. The colors and motifs appear consistent with the original design, suggesting that the pattern has been preserved. However, the texture of the wood from the hockey sticks is not incorporated into the footwear; instead, the hockey sticks remain separate and untouched. While the ski patterns are retained, their application to a boot-like structure introduces visual inconsistencies—such as the pattern continuing seamlessly across areas where a boot would normally have different material properties (e.g., leather or synthetic fabric). There is no evidence of texture blending or integration between the ski’s painted surface and the boot's upper section, making the incorporation feel superficial rather than natural. Therefore, although the patterns are preserved, their integration into footwear is not seamless or plausible.",

      "question": "Does the transition from skis and hockey sticks to footwear appear logical and plausible, maintaining the visual credibility of both the original and new forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skis have been repurposed into boots by attaching ski boots onto the top of the skis, effectively using the skis as soles. This is an imaginative transformation, but it lacks logical plausibility. Ski boots are typically rigid and attached to skis via bindings, not fused directly onto them as if they were part of the ski itself. The way the boots are positioned—with the ski base forming the bottom and the boot extending upward—creates a hybrid object that doesn't conform to real-world skiing equipment. Moreover, the hockey sticks remain unused and unaltered, lying in the snow. Their presence suggests they might be intended as accessories, but there is no functional or visual integration with the footwear. Given real-world knowledge of skiing gear, this transformation is highly implausible. It does not reflect how skis and boots interact in practice, nor does it suggest a meaningful evolution of the objects' purpose. Hence, the transition lacks visual credibility.",

      "question": "Have the fine details of the original skis and hockey sticks been preserved in the new footwear design, avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original skis in Image A display intricate, colorful patterns with fine lines, dots, and swirls. In Image B, these patterns are still visible on the ski surfaces, indicating that the artistic details have largely been preserved. However, the edges of the skis appear slightly blurred or softened where they meet the boot components, possibly due to digital manipulation. The texture of the ski material seems intact, but the addition of boot elements introduces new textures—such as laces, buckles, and stitching—that are not present in the original skis. These added features are realistic in isolation, but when combined with the ski surface, they create a mismatched aesthetic. The hockey sticks, meanwhile, remain completely unchanged and show no integration with the footwear. Their wooden grain and shape are preserved, but they are not involved in the transformation at all. Therefore, while the fine details of the skis are mostly maintained, the fusion with boot elements introduces artificial textures and disrupts the original design continuity.",

      "question": "Does the new footwear design respect the physical properties and proportions of the original skis and hockey sticks, avoiding any distortion or damage to geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original skis in Image A are long, narrow boards designed for gliding on snow. In Image B, the skis are used as the base of boots, which requires altering their intended use and structure. The transformation distorts the skis' proportions: they are now serving as soles beneath a boot, which changes their orientation and function. While the length and width of the skis appear consistent with the original, their role has shifted from sliding devices to static supports, which is physically inconsistent. The boots themselves are proportionally larger than what would realistically fit on such a narrow base, leading to imbalance and unrealistic scaling. The hockey sticks remain unaltered and are not incorporated into the footwear, meaning their physical properties are preserved but irrelevant to the transformation. Overall, the design fails to respect the physical properties of the skis—especially their flexibility, weight distribution, and intended interaction with snow—and imposes an unnatural configuration that defies engineering logic. Thus, the geometric integrity of the skis is compromised in favor of artistic expression.",
