    "Question": "Q1: Are all fine details such as spikes, rivets, and surface scratches on the armor clearly visible and undistorted after miniaturization?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is encased in a glass dome, suggesting it has been miniaturized. Despite this, the visual cues indicate that the intricate details like spikes, rivets, and surface scratches are still discernible. The lighting and clarity of the image allow these features to be seen without distortion. This conclusion is drawn from observing the sharpness and definition of these elements against the smooth background and the transparency of the glass dome.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the glass dome enclose the figure without visible seams, distortion, or unnatural refraction effects that alter the appearance of the armor?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears seamless and does not exhibit any noticeable distortion or refraction effects that would alter the appearance of the armor beneath it. The dome's transparency and the even lighting ensure that the figure inside is clearly visible without any significant visual interference. This analysis is based on the observation of the dome's uniformity and the consistent visibility of the figure's details.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the cogwheels at the base fully connected to the foundation, with interlocking teeth and consistent size ratios, and no floating or disconnected parts?",
    "explanation": "The cogwheels at the base of the figure in Image B appear to be well-integrated into the foundation. They show interlocking teeth and maintain consistent size ratios relative to each other. There are no signs of floating or disconnected parts; the mechanical components seem firmly attached and functional. This assessment is made by examining the alignment and connection points of the cogwheels within the overall structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the mechanical wings securely connected to the shoulder armor, matching the metal texture and spike design, and free of unnatural bends or misaligned joints?",
    "explanation": "The mechanical wings in Image B are visibly connected to the shoulder armor, maintaining the same metal texture and spike design as the rest of the armor. There are no apparent unnatural bends or misaligned joints, indicating a secure and coherent attachment. This conclusion is reached by closely inspecting the junctions between the wings and the armor for consistency in design and structural integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the copper pipes follow continuous paths along armor joints, maintain consistent diameter and smooth bends, and avoid intersecting with key armor components?",
    "explanation": "The copper pipes in Image B follow continuous paths along the armor joints, maintaining a consistent diameter and smooth bends. They do not intersect with key armor components, ensuring a clean and unobstructed integration with the figure. This analysis involves tracing the paths of the pipes and assessing their interaction with the surrounding armor pieces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the brass orbs positioned at varying distances around the figure, not touching or clipping into the armor or dome, and displaying uniform material finish and lighting?",
    "explanation": "The brass orbs in Image B are strategically placed at varying distances around the figure, ensuring they do not touch or clip into either the armor or the dome. They exhibit a uniform material finish and consistent lighting, contributing to an aesthetically pleasing and balanced composition. This evaluation is based on observing the spatial arrangement and visual properties of the orbs in relation to the figure and its enclosure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
