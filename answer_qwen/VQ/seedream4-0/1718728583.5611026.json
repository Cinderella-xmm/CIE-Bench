      "question": "Does the robot's body exhibit smooth, continuous chrome-like surfaces without visible texture breaks or inconsistent material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's body is rendered with highly reflective, metallic surfaces that appear to be chrome-like in finish. The torso and limbs show clean, uninterrupted lines with consistent shading and specular highlights, suggesting a uniform material application. There are no visible seams, cracks, or textural inconsistencies in the surface, which contributes to a sense of continuity. The design features sharp geometric patterns, but these are integrated into the overall form rather than appearing as separate textures. The reflections on the surface are coherent and follow the light source direction, indicating a well-modeled, homogeneous material. Based on visual cues and knowledge of 3D rendering practices, such consistency in surface appearance is indicative of a smooth, continuous material application. Therefore, the robot's body does exhibit smooth, continuous chrome-like surfaces without visible texture breaks.",

      "question": "Are the flamingos rendered as cohesive geometric shapes with consistent edges and proportions, without fragmented or disconnected components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flamingos in Image B are clearly stylized using low-poly, geometric modeling techniques. Each bird is composed of flat polygonal faces forming a faceted structure, which is characteristic of a deliberate artistic style rather than photorealism. Despite this stylization, the shapes remain cohesive—each flamingo has a defined head, neck, body, wings, and legs, all connected by clean, consistent edges. There are no visible gaps, floating fragments, or broken polygons. The proportions of the birds (e.g., long necks, slender legs) maintain biological plausibility within the stylized framework. Furthermore, the lighting and shading across the facets are uniform, reinforcing the idea that the models are intact and not fragmented. This suggests that the flamingos are rendered as complete, unified geometric forms. Thus, they are cohesive and lack disconnected components.",

      "question": "Do the palm trees and rocks in the background have angular, stylized forms that maintain consistent perspective and spatial relationships without appearing disjointed or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements—including the palm trees and rocks—are rendered in a distinct low-poly, angular aesthetic that matches the geometric style of the flamingos and robot. The rocks are composed of sharp, faceted planes, forming abstract, crystalline structures that align with the scene’s overall futuristic theme. The palm trees also adopt a simplified, polygonal design with segmented trunks and triangular fronds. These elements are positioned in a way that respects depth and perspective; for example, objects farther from the viewer are smaller and slightly blurred, creating a natural sense of distance. There are no floating or misaligned components—the rocks appear grounded in the terrain, and the trees are rooted in the landscape. The spatial relationships between foreground and background elements are coherent, with consistent vanishing points and shadow placement supporting realistic positioning. Given the stylized nature, the angular forms are intentional and do not break the scene’s continuity. Hence, the background maintains consistent perspective and spatial coherence.",

      "question": "Is the color palette across the entire scene consistently muted and pastel-toned, with no areas exhibiting sudden or jarring color deviations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color scheme in Image B is dominated by soft, warm hues—pinks, light blues, and pale oranges—typical of a sunset or sunrise ambiance. The sky has a gentle gradient from peach to lavender, while the water reflects these tones subtly. The flamingos are rendered in various shades of pink and beige, harmonizing with the environment. The robot’s chrome surface reflects these ambient colors, integrating it into the scene without introducing harsh contrasts. Even the geometric forms of the rocks and trees use muted, desaturated versions of earthy tones. There are no sudden shifts in saturation or brightness; for instance, the shadows are soft and diffused, and the highlights are gradual. The overall impression is one of visual harmony, with no jarring or overly saturated elements. This consistency supports the conclusion that the color palette is uniformly muted and pastel-toned throughout the scene.",

      "question": "Do the robot's hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural curvature and spacing, and no extra or malformed digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the robot’s hands in Image B, both hands display five distinct fingers. The fingers are articulated with clear joints and tapering forms, mimicking human anatomy in a stylized manner. The spacing between fingers appears even and proportional, with no overlapping or missing digits. The curvature of each finger follows a natural arc, consistent with biomechanical design principles, even though the overall hand is metallic and mechanical. There are no extra fingers, fused digits, or irregular shapes. The thumb is correctly positioned at an angle relative to the other fingers, allowing for a functional grip posture. While the design is sleek and futuristic, it adheres to anatomical norms in terms of digit count and arrangement. Therefore, the robot’s hands meet the criteria of having exactly five fingers each, with natural curvature and spacing.",
