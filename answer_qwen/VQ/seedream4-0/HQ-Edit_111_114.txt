    "Question": "Q1: Are the limbs of the man and the components of the scooter proportionally coherent and free from geometric distortion such as elongated arms, bent knees, or misaligned wheels?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man's limbs appear natural and proportional. His arms are not elongated; they fit comfortably on the handlebars. The knees are slightly bent in a realistic manner for someone sitting on a scooter. The wheels of the scooter are aligned correctly with no visible distortion. This analysis is based on observing the proportions and alignment of body parts and objects in relation to common human anatomy and vehicle design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the sepia tones cover all areas evenly without visible color banding, blotchy patches, or loss of detail in textures like fabric, stone, or foliage?",
    "explanation": "The sepia tones in Image B seem consistent across the image. There are no noticeable color banding or blotchy patches. Details in textures such as the man’s clothing, the stonework of the buildings, and the foliage remain discernible despite the sepia effect. This conclusion is drawn by examining the uniformity of the tone and the preservation of texture details throughout the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the edges of the image softly degraded with a smooth transition into white, without abrupt lines or visible masking artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The edges of Image B do not show any abrupt lines or masking artifacts. Instead, there is a soft degradation that blends smoothly into the white background. This observation is made by closely inspecting the borders of the image where it meets the white space, ensuring there are no harsh transitions or irregularities.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the art-nouveau frame surround the image without overlapping or cutting through the man’s face, scooter, or any background structures?",
    "explanation": "The art-nouveau frame in Image B surrounds the image completely but does not overlap or cut through any elements within the image. It maintains a clear boundary around the scene, including the man, the scooter, and the background architecture. This assessment is based on checking the interaction between the frame and the internal content of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the blank writing area located directly beneath the image, aligned horizontally, and free from warping or interference with the scooter’s base or ground line?",
    "explanation": "The blank writing area in Image B is positioned directly below the main image, aligned horizontally. It does not interfere with the scooter’s base or the ground line, maintaining a clean separation. This evaluation involves verifying the placement and alignment of the writing area relative to the rest of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the parchment texture appear uniformly across the image without causing blurring, ghosting, or obscuration of fine details like the man’s beard or window shutters?",
    "explanation": "The parchment texture in Image B is applied uniformly and does not blur, ghost, or obscure fine details. The man’s beard and the window shutters retain their clarity and definition. This conclusion is reached by assessing the texture's impact on various detailed elements within the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the postcards arranged in a stack with realistic shadows, overlapping edges, and twine wrapped around them in a way that suggests physical binding?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict a stack of postcards with shadows, overlapping edges, or twine. Instead, it shows a single framed image with a blank writing area below it. Therefore, this question is not applicable to the content of Image B. However, if we were to compare with Image A, Image B lacks these specific features entirely.",
    "answer": "No"
