      "question": "Do the trench coats and fedoras on all characters have natural fabric draping and proper fit without visible distortion or clipping against limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trench coats and fedoras on all characters appear to have natural fabric draping. The folds and shadows suggest a proper fit around their limbs without any visible distortion or clipping. The visual cues such as the way the fabric hangs and the consistent shading imply that the artist paid attention to realistic rendering of clothing. There is no indication of unnatural stretching or compression that would suggest poor fitting.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grayscale foggy cityscape background in Image B is smoothly blended with the characters. The atmospheric perspective is consistent, with buildings fading into the mist as they recede into the distance. There are no sharp boundaries between the characters and the background, and architectural details are preserved despite the foggy effect, indicating a well-executed blending technique.",
