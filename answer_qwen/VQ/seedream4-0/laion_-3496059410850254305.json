      "question": "Does the outline of the guitar body remain intact and undistorted after being converted into an armored torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar has been artistically transformed into a part of a superhero’s armored torso. The original shape of the guitar body is preserved as the central form of the armor, maintaining its characteristic curves and silhouette. Despite the transformation, the outer contour of the guitar—especially the rounded lower bout, waist, and upper bout—is still clearly recognizable and not distorted. This suggests that the artist intentionally retained the guitar's structural outline while integrating it into the armor design. There are no visible warping or stretching of the edges, which would indicate distortion. Therefore, based on visual analysis and common artistic principles in character design (where iconic shapes are often preserved for recognition), the outline remains intact.",

      "question": "Is the metallic finish applied to the guitar body consistent with the original wood grain pattern, showing no signs of artificial texture tiling or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The guitar body in Image B is overlaid with a metallic armor finish, but this does not follow the natural wood grain pattern seen in typical acoustic guitars. Instead, the metal surface appears smooth and reflective, with highlights and shadows suggesting a polished steel-like material. However, there is no attempt to preserve or mimic the wood grain beneath the metal; rather, the grain is completely obscured by the armor. While the metallic texture itself appears consistent and lacks obvious tiling artifacts, it does not align with the original wood grain pattern—it replaces it entirely. In fact, the absence of any wood grain under the metal implies that the texture was applied uniformly, which may suggest digital rendering rather than a realistic fusion. Thus, while the metal finish is coherent, it is not consistent with the original wood grain pattern, and the question specifically asks about consistency with that pattern, which is not present.",

      "question": "Are the illustrative lines evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the guitar's curvature without overlapping or cutting through structural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration features rope-like strands wrapped around the armored torso, which correspond to the guitar's strings. These lines are drawn with consistent spacing and flow along the contours of the guitar-shaped armor. They follow the natural curvature of the body and neck, avoiding sharp angles or abrupt breaks. The lines do not overlap in a way that disrupts the visual integrity of the structure, nor do they cut through critical components like the soundhole or bridge. Instead, they appear integrated into the design, enhancing the illusion of the guitar being transformed into armor. The continuity and alignment are maintained throughout, suggesting careful attention to anatomical and structural harmony in the artwork. Based on standard comic book art techniques, such clean line work is typical for dynamic yet coherent illustrations.",

      "question": "Do the strings appear as continuous, taut muscle strands that follow the body’s contour without kinks, gaps, or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar strings have been reimagined as thick, rope-like muscle strands that wrap around the armored torso. These strands are depicted as taut and continuous, running from the headstock down along the neck and over the body of the guitar-armor. They follow the curvature of the instrument smoothly, without visible kinks or gaps. There are no floating segments—each strand connects logically from one point to another, maintaining tension and directionality consistent with both real guitar string behavior and stylized anatomy. The visual metaphor of 'muscle strands' is effectively executed, blending mechanical and biological elements seamlessly. Given the nature of comic-style illustrations, where exaggerated forms are acceptable, the depiction remains plausible and well-integrated.",

      "question": "Does the cape extend naturally from the neck, showing smooth folds and consistent sound wave patterns along its length without abrupt changes or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cape in Image B flows dramatically from the shoulders of the armored figure, appearing to be made of a luminous, golden fabric. It extends outward and downward with fluid, smooth folds that suggest motion and weightlessness. The lighting emphasizes the draping effect, giving it a sense of realism despite the fantastical context. Additionally, sound wave-like patterns emanate from the headstock area, trailing behind the cape. These patterns are evenly spaced and radiate outward in a consistent manner, reinforcing the theme of music and power. There are no abrupt changes in the fold patterns or breaks in the continuity of the waves, indicating a deliberate and cohesive design choice. The integration of sound waves with the cape enhances the narrative of musical energy, and their alignment with the cape’s flow supports a harmonious visual composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the headstock of the guitar in Image B, there is a glowing emblem featuring a flame-like symbol within a shield. This emblem is centrally located and clearly visible, positioned above the tuning pegs. It does not overlap with any of the tuning pegs, which are arranged symmetrically on either side. The brand name 'Fender' is also present on the headstock, placed below the emblem, and there is no visual interference between the two elements. The emblem is properly scaled and centered, maintaining aesthetic balance. The glow effect adds emphasis without obscuring other details. From a design perspective, this placement ensures clarity and prominence, which is typical in logo placement for branding and visual impact. Thus, the emblem is fully visible, correctly aligned, and free from overlapping issues.",

      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as pixelation, color bleeding, or sharp discontinuities at the junctions between original guitar parts and added elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the transition between the original guitar components and the added armored elements is seamless. The edges of the guitar body blend smoothly into the metallic armor, with no visible pixelation, jagged lines, or color bleeding. The shading and lighting are consistent across the entire figure, suggesting high-quality digital rendering. The integration of the guitar’s wood grain (though largely covered) with the metallic surface appears intentional and unified. There are no sharp discontinuities or mismatched textures at the boundaries between the guitar and the armor. This level of cohesion indicates professional-level digital artistry, where layers are carefully blended using gradient tools and lighting effects. Therefore, no significant artifacts are present.",
