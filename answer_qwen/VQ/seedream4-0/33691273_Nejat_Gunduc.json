      "question": "Does the man’s head position and hand placement near his ear form a plausible and anatomically correct pose that conveys a contemplative state without distortion or unnatural joint angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted standing in profile, facing right, with his head slightly tilted downward and his right hand raised toward his ear. The positioning of the hand near the ear appears natural, consistent with a gesture of listening or contemplation. The angle of the elbow and wrist suggests a relaxed but deliberate motion, typical of someone pondering or focusing on sound. The neck and shoulder alignment are proportionate and do not show any signs of unnatural bending or stretching. Based on human anatomy and common postures associated with introspection (such as listening or thinking), this pose is anatomically plausible and does not exhibit distorted joints or exaggerated angles. There is no indication of digital manipulation causing unnatural curvature or misalignment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the new background elements (urban structures, lighting, and text) visually consistent with the monochrome tone and do they blend naturally without abrupt edges or conflicting textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B introduces several new background elements compared to Image A: a foggy urban street scene, streetlights, wet pavement reflecting light, buildings receding into the distance, and the addition of the 'Coca-Cola NOIR' branding on the billboard. These elements are rendered in black and white, maintaining the monochrome aesthetic of the original image. The lighting from the streetlamp creates a soft glow and atmospheric haze, which enhances depth and realism. The textures of the wet ground, brickwork, and metal lamppost appear consistent with typical urban environments. The transitions between elements—such as the edge of the billboard and the sidewalk—are smooth, with no visible pixelation or harsh seams. The overall composition blends cohesively, suggesting careful editing to preserve tonal harmony and visual continuity. The added text 'Coca-Cola NOIR' is stylistically appropriate and integrated into the advertisement without disrupting its layout.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the thought bubbles properly aligned with the man’s head, drawn with consistent line quality, and free from pixelation or overlapping distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The thought bubble in Image B is positioned above and slightly to the left of the man’s head, following standard comic-style conventions for indicating internal thoughts. It is connected to the man by a small tail pointing toward his head, ensuring clear association. The lines forming the bubble are clean, uniform in thickness, and lack jagged edges or pixelation, indicating high-quality rendering. The interior text, 'What's behind the label?', is legible and centered within the bubble. There is no overlap with other elements such as the man’s clothing or the billboard, nor are there any visual artifacts like blurring or aliasing. The style of the thought bubble is consistent with graphic design norms and integrates seamlessly into the scene without appearing digitally intrusive or poorly placed.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the man’s figure cast a consistent shadow or interact with the billboard surface in a way that preserves spatial depth and avoids floating or disconnected appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The man in Image B stands on the sidewalk adjacent to the billboard. While there is no strong directional light source casting a distinct shadow from the man onto the ground or the billboard, the ambient lighting from the streetlamp provides enough illumination to suggest depth. His silhouette is clearly separated from the background, and he appears grounded on the wet pavement. There is no evidence of floating or detachment—his feet are positioned naturally on the sidewalk, and his posture aligns with the environment. Although the lighting is diffuse due to fog, the absence of a pronounced shadow is reasonable given the overcast conditions. Importantly, there is no visual conflict where the man seems to be hovering or improperly layered over the billboard; his body remains in front of it, maintaining proper spatial hierarchy. The interaction between the man and the surrounding environment supports a coherent sense of depth and grounding.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the man’s knit cap, jacket, and facial features preserved with clear definition and no visible artifacting or over-smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The man’s knit cap shows distinct stitching patterns and texture consistent with woolen material, particularly noticeable in the crown and brim areas. The jacket displays subtle fabric folds and creases, especially around the shoulders and sleeves, indicating attention to detail in rendering textile surfaces. Facial features such as wrinkles, skin texture, and hairline are well-defined, with sharp contrasts that enhance realism without appearing overly sharpened or artificially enhanced. There are no signs of smudging, blurring, or compression artifacts that would suggest over-processing. The image maintains high fidelity in these details, suggesting that the original photograph was either carefully edited or used as a base with minimal degradation. The consistency across all textured regions indicates professional-level post-production work.",
