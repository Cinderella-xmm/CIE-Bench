      "question": "Does the plastic figurine maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the character's body, avoiding distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B depicts Thor with exaggerated musculature typical of action figures, which is common in collectible toys to emphasize heroic features. However, the proportions are generally consistent with stylized representations of Thor seen in Marvel merchandise. The limbs, torso, and head are proportionally aligned with known depictions of the character, without visible geometric distortions such as warped limbs or inconsistent joint angles. The figure stands upright on a base, suggesting structural integrity. While the physique is idealized, it does not violate basic anatomical plausibility for a fictional superhero figurine. Therefore, the proportions are maintained within acceptable artistic and commercial standards.",

      "question": "Are the added lighting effects around the plastic figurine seamlessly integrated with its surface and the surrounding desk, avoiding unnatural highlights or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting effects in Image B include glowing blue energy emanating from the hammer and a circular light halo beneath the figurine’s base. These effects appear digitally enhanced, with sharp edges and uniform glow patterns that do not mimic real-world light diffusion. The glow around the base lacks soft falloff and natural interaction with the desk surface—real light would create subtle reflections, refractions, and shadows. Additionally, the lightning effect near the hammer has an artificial, cartoonish quality with no realistic interaction with nearby objects like the keyboard or monitor. These elements suggest digital post-processing rather than physical lighting, resulting in unnatural highlights and shadow placement. Thus, while visually striking, the integration is not seamless.",

      "question": "Do the hands of the plastic figurine holding the hammer retain natural textures and shapes, with no more than five fingers and no signs of ergonomic distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand holding the hammer in Image B appears to have five distinct fingers, consistent with human anatomy. The shape of the hand is simplified but retains recognizable thumb and finger positioning appropriate for gripping the hammer handle. There is no visible evidence of extra digits, fused fingers, or severe deformation. The texture appears smooth and molded, typical of plastic figurines, with no signs of ergonomic distortion such as bent joints or unnatural curvature. Given that action figures often simplify hand details for manufacturing and articulation, this representation remains within acceptable bounds for a toy model. Therefore, the hand maintains a plausible form.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the plastic figurine retained a structurally sound head and face consistent with the character's identity, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The head of the figurine in Image B closely resembles Thor’s established appearance—blonde hair, beard, and facial structure matching actor Chris Hemsworth’s likeness as seen in Marvel films. The facial features are well-defined, with clear eyes, nose, and mouth, though slightly stylized for sculptural purposes. The texture appears smooth and uniform, typical of painted plastic, with no visible cracks, warping, or material inconsistencies. While some fine details like individual hairs or skin pores are absent (as expected in a figurine), the overall identity and structural integrity of the head are preserved. There is no sign of deformation or loss of key identifying traits. Hence, the head remains consistent with the character’s identity.",

      "question": "Do the armor and cape of the plastic figurine appear cohesive with the rest of the figurine, avoiding any unnatural textures or materials that disrupt the visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor on the figurine in Image B features metallic finishes with gold accents and segmented plates, consistent with Thor’s cinematic design. The textures appear uniform and appropriate for a molded plastic toy, with no visible seams or material mismatches. The red cape flows naturally behind the figure, maintaining fabric-like draping despite being made of rigid material. While the cape’s rigidity is unrealistic compared to actual cloth, this is typical in static figurines. The armor pieces align correctly with the body, and there are no floating or disconnected segments. The overall aesthetic is coherent with the character’s known costume, and no disruptive textures or material inconsistencies are evident. Therefore, the armor and cape remain visually plausible within the context of a collectible figurine.",
