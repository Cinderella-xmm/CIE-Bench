      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trousers in Image B drape naturally over the legs, with folds and creases that correspond logically to the posture of the figure. The way the fabric falls suggests an appropriate weight and flexibility, matching the stance of the individual. This assessment is made by analyzing the realistic depiction of fabric behavior under gravity and movement.",
