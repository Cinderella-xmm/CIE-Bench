      "question": "Does the transition area between the painting and the wall maintain the natural texture of the wall material without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the painting and the wall is examined closely. The wall appears to be a smooth, matte surface with consistent color and texture typical of painted drywall or plaster. Around the edges of the framed painting, there is no visible distortion, pixelation, or unnatural blending that would suggest digital manipulation. The shadow cast by the frame is soft and consistent with the lighting in the room, suggesting a natural depth. There are no jagged edges or color bleeding at the border of the painting, which indicates that the integration of the artwork into the wall environment is seamless. This alignment with real-world expectations for how a framed piece interacts with a wall supports the conclusion that the transition maintains the wall’s natural texture without artifacts.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the trees and water in the painting maintained realistically without appearing stretched or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The painting in Image B depicts a serene autumnal scene with trees lining both sides of a river leading toward a setting sun. Observing the proportions, the trees on either side appear symmetrical and balanced, with consistent spacing and scaling relative to the width of the river. The reflection of the trees and sun in the water is clear and proportionally accurate, showing a realistic mirror effect without elongation or compression. The perspective converges naturally toward the horizon, maintaining proper vanishing point logic. There is no visual evidence of stretching or warping—such as unnaturally tall trees or disproportionately wide water—indicating that the internal composition of the painting adheres to realistic spatial proportions. Comparing this to common artistic standards for landscape paintings, the elements are scaled appropriately, supporting the conclusion that the proportions are preserved.",

      "question": "Do the shadows and lighting in the painting align consistently with the room's light source, avoiding unnatural contrasts or disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the room is illuminated by natural light coming from the right side, likely through an arched window, casting diagonal shadows across the floor and sofa. The painting itself reflects a sunset scene with warm tones and directional lighting from the sun positioned near the horizon. However, the light within the painting (the sunset) is independent of the room’s ambient lighting and does not need to match it directly. What matters is whether the shadows cast by the physical painting and its frame align with the room’s light source. The shadow beneath the frame falls to the left, consistent with a light source from the right, and matches the direction of sunlight on the floor and sofa. There are no abrupt changes in brightness or shadow direction that contradict the room’s lighting. Thus, while the painting’s internal lighting is fictional, the physical interaction of the painting with the room’s light is coherent and natural.",

      "question": "Does the painting preserve its depth and layering, creating a believable 3D effect without disrupting its visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The painting in Image B features multiple layers: foreground trees, midground river, and background sky with a distant treeline and sun. These layers are rendered with atmospheric perspective—trees in the distance appear lighter and less detailed, while those in the foreground are richer in color and definition. The reflections in the water add depth, enhancing the illusion of space. The use of light gradients and shading contributes to a three-dimensional feel. Moreover, the frame casts a subtle shadow, reinforcing the perception of depth between the painting and the wall. There are no visual breaks or inconsistencies in the layering; the transitions between elements are smooth and logical. Combined with the realistic rendering of textures and lighting, the painting maintains strong visual coherence and a convincing 3D effect.",

      "question": "Does the frame around the painting retain its structural integrity and material appearance without visible damage or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frame in Image B is made of wood with a dark brown finish, exhibiting a classic, slightly ornate profile. It appears solid and undamaged, with clean edges and consistent grain patterns that suggest a natural wood material. There are no cracks, warping, or discolorations that would indicate deterioration. The frame casts a soft shadow that matches its thickness and position, indicating physical plausibility. Notably, the frame has been artistically embellished with autumn leaves growing out of it, which is a surreal element but does not compromise the frame’s structural integrity—it remains intact and visually coherent. While the foliage is fantastical, the frame itself retains its material appearance and form, with no signs of digital artifacting or texture disruption. Therefore, despite the creative addition, the frame’s physical realism is preserved.",
