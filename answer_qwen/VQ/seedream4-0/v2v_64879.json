      "question": "Do the industrial structures on the left side maintain their structural coherence without appearing unnaturally distorted or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the industrial structures are depicted with a painterly style that uses thick brushstrokes and vibrant colors. Despite this artistic transformation, the overall shapes and forms of the buildings remain recognizable as industrial structures. The coherence is maintained through the consistent application of the painting style across the entire structure, avoiding fragmentation. The visual cues such as the alignment of windows and the positioning of the chimneys suggest that the artist aimed to preserve the structural integrity while adding an expressive touch.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the winding brown road appear visually plausible with no broken geometric shapes or unnatural textures introduced by the brushstrokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The winding brown road in Image B is rendered with a style that mimics Van Gogh's technique, featuring swirling brushstrokes and a blend of colors. However, the road maintains its continuity and does not exhibit broken geometric shapes. The texture introduced by the brushstrokes enhances the visual interest without disrupting the natural flow of the road. The road appears to follow a logical path through the landscape, contributing to the overall plausibility of the scene.",

      "question": "Are the frosted trees and distant peaks depicted with expressive energy under the starlit night sky while retaining their natural appearance and avoiding unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frosted trees and distant peaks in Image B are portrayed with a dynamic and expressive energy characteristic of Van Gogh's style. The use of bold brushstrokes and vibrant colors captures the essence of a starlit night sky. While the depiction is highly stylized, it retains a sense of natural appearance through the coherent application of the artistic technique. There are no noticeable unnatural artifacts that detract from the overall aesthetic, as the elements blend harmoniously within the painted landscape.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the painted elements and the untouched parts of the image seamless, contributing to the overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is entirely transformed into a painted style, so there are no untouched parts to compare against. The entire image adopts the same artistic approach, ensuring a seamless transition throughout. This uniformity contributes to the overall authenticity of the painted scene, as all elements are treated consistently with the chosen artistic style. The lack of contrast between painted and untouched areas supports a cohesive and natural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the industrial structures and the road been preserved without significant loss or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B applies a painterly style that introduces new textures through brushstrokes, the fine details of the industrial structures and the road are still discernible. The artistic rendering preserves the essential features of these elements, allowing viewers to recognize them despite the stylistic changes. The introduction of new textures adds depth and character but does not significantly distort the original details, maintaining a balance between artistic expression and recognizability.",
