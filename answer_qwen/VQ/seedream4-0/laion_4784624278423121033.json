      "question": "Is the atom illustration placed in the same location as the original dough and does it have a smooth, continuous edge without jagged lines or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the atom-shaped indentation in the dough appears to be in the same position as the one in Image A, indicating that the placement of the atomic shape has been preserved. The edges of the indentation are clean and smooth, with no visible jagged lines or gaps, suggesting that the cookie cutter was pressed firmly and evenly into the dough. This is consistent with typical cookie-cutting behavior where a well-designed cutter produces a continuous outline. The visual continuity and precision of the cut suggest high-quality application, likely using a plastic cutter designed for such shapes. There are no signs of tearing or incomplete cuts, which would indicate poor technique or tool quality.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the additional atom-shaped cookies the same size as the original dough and do they have colors that blend naturally with the beige dough and wooden background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The additional atom-shaped cookies (blue, yellow, and pink) are significantly smaller than the original dough piece. They are decorative elements placed on top of the dough, not replacements for it. Their sizes are proportionally scaled down to represent subatomic particles like protons and neutrons, which is consistent with educational illustrations. In terms of color, the bright blue, yellow, and pink hues stand out against the beige dough and wooden background, which enhances visibility rather than blending in. While they don’t 'blend' naturally (as their purpose is to contrast and highlight), this is intentional for clarity in teaching context. Therefore, they do not match the size of the original dough, nor do they blend with the background—they are meant to pop visually.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arrows point directly to the correct parts of the atom (electrons, protons, neutrons) without crossing over or distorting the atomic shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrows in Image B are labeled 'electrons', 'protons', and 'neutrons'. The arrow labeled 'electrons' points toward the outer orbitals of the atomic shape, which is accurate since electrons occupy electron shells around the nucleus. The 'protons' and 'neutrons' labels point to the central area of the atom shape, which corresponds to the nucleus—where protons and neutrons reside. However, the arrows do cross over each other slightly near the center, and the 'neutrons' arrow curves around the bottom right, potentially overlapping with the yellow cookie. This minor distortion may affect clarity but doesn't completely obscure the intended meaning. Still, the general direction is correct, though there is some overlap and non-ideal spacing. Given that the goal is educational visualization, the accuracy of labeling outweighs minor distortions, but strictly speaking, the arrows do cross and distort slightly.",

      "question": "Is the title text \"Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry\" clearly visible, positioned above the illustrations, and does it not overlap with the atom shapes or cookie cutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title text 'Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry' is clearly visible at the top of the image, centered above the main illustration. It is written in large, white font with a slight shadow effect, making it stand out against the wooden background. Importantly, the text is positioned above the dough and cookie cutter, and there is no overlap with any part of the atom shape or the cookie cutter. This ensures readability and maintains visual separation between the title and the content below. The placement follows standard graphic design principles for titles—above the subject matter and unobstructed.",

      "question": "Are the dotted lines straight, uniformly spaced, and positioned between sections without covering the atom illustrations or cookie cutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dotted lines in Image B form circular paths around the central atom shape and connect the labels ('electrons', 'protons', 'neutrons') to their respective parts. These lines are mostly straight and uniformly spaced, forming dashed arcs that follow the orbital paths of electrons. They are carefully drawn to avoid covering the cookie cutter or the main atom indentation. However, the lines extend close to the edges of the atom shape and even touch the small colored cookies, particularly near the 'neutrons' label. While they do not fully cover the main shapes, they come very close, which could be considered a minor obstruction. Additionally, the spacing is consistent but not perfectly uniform due to curvature. Overall, the lines serve their purpose but slightly intrude on the visual space of the cookies.",
