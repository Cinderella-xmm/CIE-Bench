    "Question": "Q1: Does the retro-style stove maintain its structural consistency without any visible distortion or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the retro-style stove is depicted with a clean, symmetrical design typical of mid-20th-century appliances. Its structure includes four burners on a black grate, five control knobs aligned horizontally, and a visible oven door with a glass window. The coloration is consistent—cream with black trim—and there are no visible distortions such as warped edges, misaligned components, or texture anomalies (e.g., pixelation or unnatural shading). The proportions appear accurate relative to standard vintage stoves, and the rendering lacks any signs of digital artifacts like jagged lines or inconsistent lighting. This suggests that the stove maintains structural consistency and realistic visual fidelity within the stylized illustration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the retro fridge depicted with a natural appearance, free from any obvious artifacts or unnatural blending with the surrounding elements?",
    "explanation": "The retro refrigerator in Image B is rendered in a cream color with silver handles and a central logo, consistent with 1950s design aesthetics. It features two compartments with horizontal dividers, which aligns with typical vintage refrigerators. The fridge appears slightly detached from the background, but this is likely due to the card’s frame design rather than poor blending. There are no visible seams, transparency issues, or clipping artifacts at its edges. The shadow beneath it is soft and appropriately placed, suggesting proper depth integration. While the fridge is stylized, it remains visually coherent and does not exhibit unnatural textures or blending problems. The green side panel adds a subtle detail that enhances realism without introducing inconsistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the wooden utensils exhibit a natural wood texture and appearance, without any signs of unnatural artifacts or degradation?",
    "explanation": "The wooden utensils in Image B are shown in a small bowl on the right side of the kitchen scene. They are illustrated with smooth, rounded shapes typical of spoons and spatulas. The texture appears consistent with natural wood grain, though simplified due to the illustrative style. There are no visible cracks, warping, or digital artifacts such as noise or unnatural color gradients. The lighting on the utensils is uniform and matches the overall warm tone of the scene, indicating intentional artistic rendering rather than technical flaws. Given that the image is a stylized depiction, minor simplifications in texture are acceptable; however, no clear signs of degradation or artificiality are present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the patterned tiles in the background visually plausible and consistent with the vintage theme, without any noticeable distortion or unnatural gradients?",
    "explanation": "The background tiles in Image B feature a grid of square tiles in muted earth tones—browns and greens—with subtle variation in hue, which is characteristic of vintage kitchen designs. The pattern is regular and evenly spaced, maintaining alignment across the wall behind the stove and counter. There are no visible distortions such as warping, misalignment, or repeating patterns that suggest tiling errors. The gradient between tiles is smooth and consistent with natural material variation. While the tile rendering is simplified compared to photorealistic images, it remains plausible within the context of an illustrated retro aesthetic. No unnatural gradients or digital artifacts are evident.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the soft floor shadows beneath the card appear natural and enhance the grounded presentation, without causing any visual inconsistencies or disruptions?",
    "explanation": "The shadow beneath the card in Image B is soft and diffused, extending outward from the bottom edge of the card in a way that mimics natural light interaction with a physical object on a surface. The shadow's intensity decreases gradually toward the edges, creating a sense of depth and grounding the card in the scene. It aligns well with the lighting direction suggested by the rest of the image—likely coming from the upper left—and does not overlap or interfere with the card’s content. There are no sharp edges, irregularities, or unexpected dark spots that would indicate digital artifacts or poor rendering. The shadow enhances realism without disrupting the composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
