    "Question": "Q1: Are the puzzle sections on the horseâ€™s body clearly defined with clean, interlocking edges that follow the natural curves of the horse's form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is depicted as a jigsaw puzzle with distinct sections. The edges of these sections appear to be cleanly cut and interlock in a way that follows the contours of the horse's body. This suggests an intentional design choice to mimic a three-dimensional puzzle where each piece fits into the next. The visual cues such as sharp lines and the alignment of the pieces along the horse's natural shape support this conclusion.",
