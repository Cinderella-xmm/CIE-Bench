    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sheet music patterns are integrated into the butterfly's wings. Observing the orange sections of the wings, the musical notes and staff lines appear to be seamlessly blended with the natural vein lines of the wing. There are no visible texture artifacts or disruptions in the pattern that would suggest a break in the design. The integration seems smooth, maintaining the aesthetic integrity of the wing's appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The antennae in Image B extend from the butterfly's head in a manner that appears smooth and continuous. There are no abrupt kinks or breaks in their curvature, and their length seems proportionate relative to the size of the butterfly. This observation aligns with common representations of butterfly antennae, which typically exhibit a gentle curve without irregularities.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The newly added flowers in Image B have petals shaped like musical notes. While these petals maintain a certain level of curvature consistent with real petals, they also clearly represent musical notes, which is an artistic choice rather than a natural form. However, the thickness and curvature do not seem unnatural for stylized floral art, balancing between the concept of musical notes and petal-like forms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly and surrounding flowers are arranged in a visually balanced circular pattern. Each element, including the butterfly and various flowers, appears at plausible distances and angles relative to one another, creating a harmonious composition. This arrangement enhances the overall symmetry and visual appeal of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

Upon close inspection, there are no visible aliasing or jagged edges along the letterforms, indicating high-quality rendering. The text appears crisp and well-defined, contributing to the polished look of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
