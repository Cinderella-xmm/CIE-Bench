    "Question": "Q1: Are the embroidered patterns on the butterfly’s wings and body aligned with the original gemstone positions and do they display consistent thread density and color without visible breaks or misalignments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings feature intricate gold embroidery depicting floral and leaf-like patterns on a deep blue velvet background. The embroidery is dense and continuous, with no visible breaks or irregularities in thread application. The patterns are symmetrically placed on both wings, suggesting careful alignment. However, there is no direct visual evidence of gemstone positions from the original image (Image A) being preserved—since the design has been transformed from gemstones to embroidery, the alignment cannot be directly compared to gemstone locations. Instead, the embroidery appears organically distributed across the wings, following natural decorative motifs rather than replicating gemstone placement. The color consistency is strong, with gold thread uniformly applied and no noticeable color shifts or breaks. Therefore, while the embroidery itself is well-executed, it does not replicate the original gemstone layout but creates a new aesthetic. Based on the quality of the embroidery alone, the answer is 'Yes' for consistency and alignment within its own design context.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the butterfly’s body and frame appear made of soft fabric with no visible metallic shine or rigid edges, and does it show natural fabric folds or drape?",
    "explanation": "The butterfly’s body in Image B is crafted from a plush, dark blue fabric that matches the wings in texture and color, suggesting it is part of the same material set. There is no visible metallic sheen or rigid structure; instead, the body has a soft, rounded appearance consistent with fabric. The antennae are gold-colored and appear metallic, which is a deliberate design choice rather than an error. However, the body itself shows subtle folds and draping, especially where it connects to the wings, indicating flexibility and softness. The overall impression is one of textile craftsmanship rather than metal or hard plastic. Thus, the body appears to be made of soft fabric with appropriate drape, despite the metallic antennae. The question specifically refers to the body and frame, and since the frame (the outline) is not metallic but rather integrated into the fabric, it meets the criteria. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the wing surfaces exhibit a uniform, matte, soft-textured appearance consistent with velvet, with no shiny spots or reflections resembling gemstones?",
    "explanation": "The wing surfaces in Image B are clearly covered in a deep blue velvet material, which has a characteristic matte finish and soft texture. Velvet typically absorbs light rather than reflecting it, and this is evident here—the surface lacks any glossy highlights or specular reflections that would suggest gemstones or polished materials. While the gold embroidery adds reflective elements, these are limited to the threadwork and do not interfere with the overall matte quality of the velvet. There are no shiny spots that resemble gemstones, as seen in Image A. The texture appears consistent across both wings, reinforcing the impression of high-quality velvet. Thus, the wing surfaces meet the criteria for a uniform, matte, soft-textured appearance. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the fluffy trim along the wing edges evenly distributed, soft, and attached in a way that follows the wing’s natural curve without appearing detached or uneven?",
    "explanation": "The edges of the butterfly’s wings in Image B are lined with a soft, white, fluffy trim that resembles fur or faux fur. This trim is consistently applied along the entire perimeter of both wings, following their natural curved shape closely. There are no visible gaps, clumps, or areas where the trim appears loose or uneven. The attachment seems seamless, and the fluffiness contributes to a luxurious, tactile appearance. The trim enhances the organic feel of the butterfly, complementing the velvet and embroidery. Given the even distribution and adherence to the wing contours, it can be concluded that the trim is properly applied. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the butterfly’s wings symmetrically shaped, the body proportionate to the wings, and the antennae correctly positioned and curved, with no visible warping or scaling errors?",
    "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B exhibits excellent symmetry in wing shape—both forewings and hindwings mirror each other in size, curvature, and pattern placement. The body is centrally located and proportionally sized relative to the wings, maintaining a balanced silhouette. The antennae are gold, thin, and gracefully curved upward, extending naturally from the head region. They follow a typical butterfly morphology and are symmetrically placed. There are no signs of warping, distortion, or unnatural scaling. The overall form is anatomically plausible and aesthetically harmonious. Even though this is a stylized representation, the proportions and positioning adhere to realistic butterfly anatomy. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the butterfly resting on a smooth, uniformly pearl-white cushion with a natural shadow underneath, indicating proper contact and physical grounding?",
    "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B is placed atop a small, square cushion that is cream or pearl-white in color, with a satin-like sheen and a delicate border of pearls. The surface of the cushion is smooth and uniformly colored, with no wrinkles or distortions. A soft, natural shadow is visible beneath the butterfly and the cushion, suggesting that both objects are resting on a flat surface and casting realistic shadows due to directional lighting. The shadow indicates proper physical grounding and depth, reinforcing the sense of three-dimensionality. The cushion appears slightly indented under the butterfly’s weight, which further suggests real contact and stability. Therefore, the cushion and shadow presentation are consistent with a well-composed, grounded scene. The answer is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"
