      "question": "Are the clock faces and architectural details of the tower clearly visible and structurally consistent despite the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock faces are clearly depicted with Roman numerals and hands, maintaining their circular shape and legibility despite the stylized presentation. The architectural elements such as the pointed roof, arched openings at the base, vertical windows, and decorative cornices are simplified but still recognizable and proportionally consistent with the original structure. The cartoon style uses clean lines and bold outlines to define these features, which enhances clarity rather than obscuring them. Based on world knowledge, clock towers like this (e.g., the Albert Clock Tower in Belfast) have distinct architectural symmetry and design elements that are preserved here through intentional simplification. Thus, while stylized, the structural consistency is maintained.",

      "question": "Do the surfaces of the clock tower and surrounding elements retain their natural textures without any noticeable loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the clock tower and surrounding environment are rendered in a cartoon style, which inherently abstracts real-world textures. Instead of showing stone grain, weathering, or subtle surface variations, the tower has flat color fills with minimal shading. Trees are simplified into solid green shapes with no bark texture or leaf detail, and the road lacks asphalt granularity. This is characteristic of cartoon illustrations, where texture is replaced by stylized representation for visual clarity and aesthetic appeal. While the loss of fine textural detail is expected in such art styles, it results in a noticeable departure from natural textures. Therefore, the image does not retain natural textures.",

      "question": "Does the edited image avoid introducing any unnatural artifacts or distortions in the clock tower and its surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized version of the clock tower with exaggerated proportions and simplified forms typical of cartoon art. However, there are no obvious digital artifacts such as pixelation, warping, or misaligned edges. The tower maintains a coherent silhouette, and the perspective appears consistent. The cars, trees, and road markings are also drawn with smooth lines and logical placement. Although the style alters realism, it does so in a controlled and intentional manner without introducing glitches or physically impossible distortions (e.g., floating objects, inconsistent shadows). Based on common sense about cartoon rendering, such stylistic choices are acceptable and do not constitute unnatural artifacts. Hence, the image avoids introducing such issues.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the clock tower and its surroundings logically maintained in the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower remains central and dominant in the composition, standing taller than the surrounding cars and trees, which aligns with its real-world scale. The roundabout is appropriately sized to accommodate the tower’s base, and vehicles appear proportionate relative to each other and the structure. The spacing between trees along the road and the curvature of the roadway suggest a plausible spatial layout. Although the cartoon style exaggerates some elements (e.g., tree foliage), the overall depth, perspective, and relative sizes remain logically consistent with real-world expectations. Comparing with Image A, the proportions are similarly preserved—only the rendering style changes. Thus, despite stylization, the physical relationships are maintained.",

      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the clock tower and its surroundings remain intact and undistorted in the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock tower in Image B retains its fundamental geometric integrity: the tower is a rectangular prism with a pyramidal roof, the arches at the base are true semicircles, and the clock faces are perfectly circular. Vertical lines remain straight, and horizontal elements are level, indicating no significant distortion. The surrounding elements—such as the roundabout, roads, and cars—also maintain their basic geometric forms (circles, rectangles, etc.). While simplifications occur (e.g., flattened trees, simplified car shapes), these are stylistic choices within cartoon conventions and do not involve warping or stretching of shapes. There is no evidence of shearing, bulging, or non-uniform scaling that would indicate distortion. Therefore, the geometric shapes remain intact.",
