      "question": "Do the robot figures derived from the batteries have limbs and heads that are proportionally sized and attached in a way that maintains structural coherence with their original cylindrical form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot figures in Image B appear to be stylized representations inspired by Duracell batteries, which are cylindrical in shape. However, upon close inspection, the limbs and heads of these robots are not proportionally scaled or structurally coherent with a cylinder's geometry. For example, the arms and legs extend outward in ways that do not logically follow from a cylindrical base, and the joints and head placements seem arbitrary rather than derived from the battery’s form. While creative liberty is taken in design, the transformation lacks a clear morphological link between the original cylindrical shape of a battery and the humanoid structure. This suggests that the design prioritizes aesthetic appeal over structural fidelity to the source object.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the robot figures made from the batteries rendered with a consistent metallic texture that mimics copper and black materials without visible artifacts like checkerboard patterns or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot figures feature a combination of copper-colored and black sections, consistent with the color scheme of Duracell Coppertop batteries. The rendering appears smooth, with reflective highlights that suggest a metallic finish. There are no visible checkerboard patterns (which would indicate low-resolution textures or compression artifacts), nor are there glaringly unnatural reflections such as those seen in poorly rendered 3D models. The lighting across the surfaces follows a coherent direction, enhancing the perception of depth and material consistency. The copper areas exhibit warm tones with subtle gradients, while the black sections have blue accent lighting that adds a futuristic feel without compromising realism. Thus, the surface textures are well-rendered and consistent with high-quality digital art standards.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the digital cityscape background positioned behind the robot figures with correct layering, atmospheric gradient, and light source alignment that matches the direction of illumination on the robots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background features a futuristic cityscape with glowing lines, skyscrapers, and digital overlays, typical of sci-fi aesthetics. The layering appears correct: the robots are in the foreground, the city is mid-ground, and the sky forms the backdrop. The atmospheric gradient transitions smoothly from orange at the horizon to darker hues above, suggesting either sunrise or sunset, which aligns with the warm ambient lighting on the robots. The light sources in the scene—such as the neon-blue lines on the ground and the glow from the buildings—appear to originate from similar directions as the illumination on the robots, particularly the highlights on their metallic surfaces. This coherence in lighting direction enhances the sense of depth and spatial logic. Therefore, the background is properly layered and lit in harmony with the foreground elements.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the digital screen displaying “10 Years in Storage” seamlessly integrated into the scene with readable text, smooth edges, and ambient lighting that matches the sci-fi theme without pixelation or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital screen is placed in front of the robot figures and displays the text '10 Years in Storage' clearly. The text is legible, with sharp edges and no visible pixelation or blurring. The screen has a glowing blue interface with circuit-like patterns, fitting the sci-fi theme. The ambient lighting around the screen matches the overall color palette of the scene—cool blues contrasting with warm oranges—and the glow emanates naturally from the display, casting soft reflections on nearby surfaces. There are no visual artifacts such as jagged lines or distorted fonts, indicating high-quality rendering. The integration of the screen into the environment feels natural and thematically consistent.",

      "question": "Is the title \"Duracell Guardians: Power Preserve Adventures!\" displayed in a clean, bold, futuristic font with uniform stroke width and no visual artifacts like jagged edges or overlapping glyphs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title is prominently displayed at the top of the image. The font used for 'DURACELL' is bold, blocky, and modern, consistent with the brand’s established typography. The subtitle 'Guardians: Power Preserve Adventures!' uses a slightly thinner but still clean and futuristic sans-serif font. All characters have uniform stroke widths, and there are no visible jagged edges, aliasing, or overlapping glyphs. The text is crisp and well-aligned, with proper spacing between letters and words. The use of white text on a dark background ensures high contrast and readability. Overall, the typography is professionally executed and fits the sci-fi narrative tone.",

      "question": "Are the robot figures, title, and digital screen arranged in a way that avoids overlapping text or important visual elements, ensuring all components are legible and distinct?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of Image B places the four robot figures in the center, forming a balanced group. The title is positioned at the top, well above the figures, avoiding any overlap. The digital screen is located in the lower central area, slightly in front of the robots but not obscuring their key features. Importantly, none of the robot figures block the title or the screen, and vice versa. The text remains fully visible and unobstructed. Additionally, the layout allows each element—robots, title, and screen—to stand out due to strategic placement and contrast in color and lighting. There is no visual clutter or interference between major components, making the entire scene easy to interpret and visually coherent.",
