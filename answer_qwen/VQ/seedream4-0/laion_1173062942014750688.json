      "question": "Are the individual bead segments aligned in a smooth, continuous curve that mimics the natural curvature of a serpent's body without abrupt angular breaks or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's body is composed of segmented bead-like structures that form a continuous, sinuous curve. The curvature appears smooth and natural, resembling the flexible movement of a real snake. There are no visible angular breaks or misaligned joints between segments; instead, each segment flows into the next in a way that mimics the organic flexibility of a serpent’s spine. This continuity suggests careful design to replicate biological form. The alignment follows a natural S-shaped coil, which is typical for snakes when resting or moving. Therefore, based on visual cues and knowledge of animal anatomy, the alignment appears consistent with a naturally curved serpent body.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blue circular elements positioned at the head end of the serpent in a symmetrical, forward-facing arrangement typical of animal eyes, and do they appear integrated into the surface rather than floating or disconnected?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue circular elements at the head end of the serpent in Image B are positioned symmetrically on either side of the snout, directly facing forward as would be expected for eyes in a bilateral animal like a snake. These elements are embedded within the surface of the head, appearing integrated into the overall structure rather than floating above it. Their placement and integration suggest deliberate artistic design to simulate realistic eye positioning. Additionally, their glossy appearance contrasts slightly with the surrounding matte texture but remains consistent with how eyes might reflect light. This arrangement aligns with typical animal morphology and aesthetic expectations for a snake’s facial features.",

      "question": "Do the black tribal markings follow the natural flow of the serpent’s body segments and avoid sharp, unnatural edges or uniform repetition that suggests digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black tribal markings on the serpent’s body in Image B follow the contours of the segmented scales, flowing along the curves of the body in a way that suggests intentional design inspired by natural patterns. While the markings are stylized and not biologically accurate, they maintain a sense of organic flow without sharp, jagged edges or repetitive geometric shapes that would indicate digital artifacting. The pattern varies across different sections, avoiding uniformity that could signal artificial generation. Instead, the lines appear hand-painted or sculpted, with slight irregularities that enhance realism. This variation supports the conclusion that the markings were designed to follow the natural flow of the body rather than being mechanically repeated.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tail extend naturally from the rear of the serpent, tapering smoothly and ending in small, loosely connected bead-like tips that appear to hang or sway without breaking the continuity of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail of the serpent in Image B extends from the rear of the body and tapers smoothly toward the end, maintaining the same segmented, bead-like structure as the rest of the body. At the tip, there are small, loosely connected bead-like elements attached to thin strands resembling hair or fibers, which hang downward and give the impression of swaying motion. These terminal beads are not rigidly fixed but appear suspended, contributing to a dynamic, lifelike quality. The transition from the main body to the tail is seamless, and the tapering is gradual, preserving structural continuity. Although the addition of hair-like strands is unconventional, it does not break the continuity of the form—it enhances it by suggesting movement or decoration. Thus, the tail extends naturally and maintains coherence with the overall design.",

      "question": "Is the surface texture of the serpent’s body uniformly matte or slightly glossy like the original beads, without introducing areas of unnatural shine, roughness, or inconsistent material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface texture of the serpent’s body in Image B appears uniformly matte with subtle highlights that suggest a slightly glossy finish, consistent with painted ceramic or polymer materials often used in beadwork. There are no abrupt changes in texture—such as patches of unnatural shine, roughness, or inconsistent material properties—that would imply poor craftsmanship or digital manipulation. The scales have a consistent depth and finish, with variations only in color and pattern, not in surface quality. This uniformity matches the expected appearance of handcrafted items made from similar materials as seen in Image A (the original beads), where individual beads also exhibit a consistent matte-to-slight-gloss finish. Therefore, the surface texture is coherent and plausible within the context of the material and design.",
