      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the badge maintain the same level of detail and texture as the vibrant domes and intricate patterns of the building, avoiding unnatural textures or loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge features a depiction of St. Basil's Cathedral, which is known for its colorful, ornate domes and detailed architectural patterns. The artwork on the badge captures these elements with stylized precision—each dome is rendered with distinct colors and patterns, such as the blue-and-white striped dome and the green-and-gold checkered one, reflecting the actual cathedral’s design. However, due to the small scale of the badge, some fine architectural details (like individual arches or decorative brickwork) are simplified or abstracted for artistic effect rather than literal replication. This simplification is typical in miniature art forms like pendants or ornaments, where fidelity must be balanced with aesthetic coherence. While the overall impression of richness and complexity is preserved, the level of micro-texture seen in the original building (as in Image A) is not fully replicated. Thus, the badge maintains an acceptable level of detail for its medium but does not match the full textural fidelity of the real structure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes and proportions of the badge consistent with the architectural style of the building, ensuring no distortion or breakage of shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The badge in Image B presents a circular, stylized representation of St. Basil's Cathedral. The central tower and surrounding onion domes are proportionally arranged within the circular frame, maintaining the general spatial hierarchy of the actual building. Despite being compressed into a smaller space, the relative heights and positions of the towers are preserved, and the iconic onion-shaped domes retain their characteristic curvature. There is no visible warping or stretching of structural elements; instead, the design uses perspective and artistic scaling to fit the complex architecture into a compact format. This approach aligns with common practices in souvenir art, where architectural landmarks are adapted to fit symbolic or decorative formats without sacrificing recognizability. Therefore, the geometric integrity of the building is respected, even if simplified.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the tassel material of the badge appear soft and flexible, and does the circular form look natural and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tassels hanging from the bottom of the badge in Image B are depicted with smooth, layered strands in red, blue, and orange. Their shape suggests a fabric-like texture, and the way they drape downward indicates flexibility and softness, consistent with traditional tassel materials such as silk or cotton. The circular form of the badge itself appears symmetrical and evenly framed by a golden border, with no signs of warping or flattening. The inner illustration of the cathedral is centered and proportionally balanced within the circle, suggesting careful design. There are no visual artifacts indicating digital distortion or unnatural rigidity. Overall, both the tassels and the circular badge exhibit a natural, harmonious appearance appropriate for a hand-held ornament.",

      "question": "Does the hand presenting the badge have a natural appearance, with no more than five fingers, and do the lines and shapes conform to ergonomics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand in Image B shows five fingers, which is anatomically correct. The positioning of the fingers—curved around the badge—suggests a natural grip, with the thumb on one side and four fingers on the other. The contours of the hand, including knuckles, joints, and fingernails, are drawn with attention to human anatomy, though slightly stylized in a cartoonish or illustrative manner. The shading and lighting enhance the three-dimensional feel, and there is no indication of extra fingers or unnatural bending. While not photorealistic, the hand adheres to ergonomic principles and maintains a plausible human form. This consistency supports the realism of the scene despite the artistic style.",

      "question": "Does the placement of the badge integrate seamlessly into the image, maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility without introducing any artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The badge is held in the foreground by a hand against a sky background, creating a clear focal point. Its placement is logical: it is centered and clearly visible, with the hand providing context for scale and interaction. The lighting on the badge matches the ambient light of the sky, and shadows on the hand suggest consistent illumination from above. There are no visible seams, edges, or digital artifacts that would indicate poor integration. The background sky continues smoothly behind the hand and badge, and the composition feels balanced. Although the image has an illustrative style, the integration of the badge into the scene is coherent and visually plausible, with no distortions or inconsistencies that would disrupt the viewer’s perception.",
