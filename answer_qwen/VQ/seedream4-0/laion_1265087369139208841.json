    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the crystal orb surrounding the castle have clean, unbroken edges without visible distortion or bending of the castleâ€™s structure inside it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal orb in Image B appears to have clean, unbroken edges. The visual cues suggest that the castle's structure inside the orb is not distorted or bent; it maintains its architectural integrity as seen through the transparent surface of the orb. This conclusion is drawn by observing the consistent shape and alignment of the castle's features within the orb, which align with expectations for a clear, undistorted view through glass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the clouds positioned above the castle without overlapping or clipping through any architectural elements, and do they have soft, natural-looking edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds in Image B are positioned above the castle without overlapping or clipping through any architectural elements. They exhibit soft, natural-looking edges, suggesting they were carefully integrated into the scene. This analysis is based on the observation that the clouds do not intersect with the castle's structure in an unnatural way and their edges blend smoothly with the background, mimicking real-world cloud formations.",

      "question": "Do the vines climb the castle walls from the bottom upward, following the wall contours without breaking the stone texture or appearing to float in mid-air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vines in Image B climb the castle walls from the bottom upward, following the wall contours closely. They appear to integrate well with the stone texture of the castle, without breaking it or floating in mid-air. This assessment is made by noting how the vines adhere to the surface of the walls, respecting the physical boundaries and textures of the stone, which is consistent with how vines typically grow on structures.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gem-like flowers placed within the garden beds at a natural scale, with no excessive glare or repeating textures that indicate artificial rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gem-like flowers in Image B are placed within the garden beds at what appears to be a natural scale. There is no excessive glare or repeating textures that would indicate artificial rendering. The flowers look like they belong in the scene, with appropriate lighting and shading that matches the rest of the image. This conclusion is reached by examining the size, placement, and visual properties of the flowers in relation to the surrounding environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dragon positioned on a stable part of the central tower, proportionally small compared to the structure, and casting a shadow aligned with the ambient light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon in Image B is positioned on a stable part of the central tower and is proportionally small compared to the structure. It casts a shadow aligned with the ambient light source, indicating careful attention to lighting consistency. This analysis involves checking the dragon's placement relative to the tower, its size in comparison to the castle, and the direction and intensity of its shadow, all of which contribute to a realistic appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the gold base lie flush with the ground, extend evenly under the castle, and show consistent engraved patterns without jagged edges or texture errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold base in Image B lies flush with the ground, extending evenly under the castle. It shows consistent engraved patterns without jagged edges or texture errors. This is determined by observing the base's alignment with the ground, its uniformity in design, and the absence of any visual artifacts that would suggest a lack of coherence in its construction.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all added elements (orb, clouds, vines, dragon, flowers, base) structurally coherent with the original castle, showing no broken lines, floating components, or conflicting lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All added elements (orb, clouds, vines, dragon, flowers, base) in Image B are structurally coherent with the original castle. There are no broken lines, floating components, or conflicting lighting. Each element has been integrated thoughtfully, maintaining the overall realism and harmony of the scene. This conclusion is reached by evaluating the interaction between each added element and the castle, ensuring that they complement rather than disrupt the visual narrative.",
