      "question": "Does the surface of the painted figure show consistent brushstroke patterns and subtle texture variations typical of oil paint on wood, without blocky or repetitive digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the painted figure in Image B displays a richly textured appearance with visible brushstrokes that vary in direction and pressure, particularly noticeable in the beard, clothing, and background. These strokes are irregular and layered, mimicking the natural application of oil paint on canvas or wood. The transitions between colors are smooth yet retain tactile variation, suggesting hand-painted techniques rather than digital rendering. There are no visible blocky patterns, pixelation, or repetitive textures that would indicate low-resolution digital artifacts. The overall aesthetic aligns closely with traditional oil painting methods, especially in the way light interacts with the surface—creating soft highlights and depth through impasto-like effects. This is consistent with the style of Vincent van Gogh’s work, which is known for its expressive brushwork. Therefore, the surface shows characteristics typical of oil paint on wood, without signs of digital corruption.",

      "question": "Do the strands of the elongated beard and mustache maintain continuous, fiber-like structure without forming unnatural loops, droplets, or fluid-like surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beard and mustache in Image B are rendered with long, flowing strands that exhibit a wavy, hair-like texture. Each strand appears to follow a natural curvature, maintaining continuity and coherence throughout the length. The color gradients—from white to blue-green—suggest depth and volume, but do not disrupt the fibrous appearance. There are no visible droplet formations, liquid-like pooling, or abrupt breaks in the strands that would suggest digital over-rendering or AI-generated anomalies. Instead, the beard has a sculpted, almost three-dimensional quality, consistent with how real hair might drape under gravity and lighting. The mustache curls outward in a stylized manner, but the form remains plausible and structurally coherent. Given the artistic intent (likely inspired by fantasy or romantic portraiture), the exaggerated curling is acceptable as stylistic choice, not a flaw. Thus, the beard and mustache maintain a realistic fiber-like structure without unnatural distortions.",

      "question": "Is the velvet texture of the cloak smooth and reflective with depth, and are the golden embroidery lines evenly spaced and aligned with the fabric folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cloak in Image B appears to be made of dark, rich fabric resembling velvet, with a slight sheen that reflects light subtly across its surface, indicating depth and texture. The folds are well-defined, casting shadows that enhance the perception of volume. The golden embroidery along the edges features intricate floral patterns with consistent spacing and alignment relative to the fabric's contours. The gold threads follow the natural curves of the cloth, suggesting careful attention to detail and integration with the textile's draping. There are no misalignments, jagged lines, or floating elements in the embroidery. The reflection on the velvet is soft and diffuse, avoiding harsh specular highlights that would suggest synthetic material. Overall, the visual cues support a high-quality rendering of velvet with realistic texture and properly placed, harmonious embroidery.",

      "question": "Is the wide-brimmed hat positioned correctly on the head without distorting the skull shape, and are the peacock feathers attached along the brim with natural curvature and no clipping into the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wide-brimmed hat sits squarely atop the figure’s head, conforming naturally to the cranial shape without causing any visible distortion or compression of the forehead or temples. The silhouette of the head beneath the hat maintains anatomical proportions, with no bulges or flattening that would suggest warping. A single peacock feather is affixed to the left side of the hat’s brim, extending upward with a graceful, curved arc. Its eye-pattern is clearly visible and follows the natural structure of a real peacock feather. Importantly, the feather does not intersect or clip into the face; it remains spatially separated from the cheek and jawline. The placement is both aesthetically balanced and physically plausible. The hat’s brim casts a soft shadow over the face, further reinforcing its correct positioning. There are no signs of digital misalignment or clipping artifacts.",

      "question": "Does the brooch cast a soft shadow onto the cloak and reflect light consistently with its surroundings, indicating proper placement and integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brooch, located at the center of the chest, features a large blue gemstone surrounded by ornate gold detailing. It casts a faint, diffused shadow downward onto the wooden-textured vest beneath it, which is consistent with the light source coming from the upper left (as suggested by highlights on the face and hat). The shadow is soft and gradual, not sharp or disconnected, indicating realistic interaction with the surface. Additionally, the brooch reflects ambient light in a way that matches the surrounding materials—gold parts shine warmly, while the gemstone captures highlights that resemble refracted light. The reflections are coherent with the overall lighting scheme of the scene, including the swirling stars in the background. This suggests careful attention to global illumination and material properties, supporting the conclusion that the brooch is properly integrated into the composition.",

      "question": "Are the edges of the figure cleanly separated from the background without haloing, double outlines, or partial transparency that suggests poor compositing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boundary between the figure and the background in Image B is sharp and clean, with no visible haloing, feathering, or ghosting around the outline. The transition from the figure to the swirling night sky is seamless, and there are no signs of double outlines or semi-transparent pixels that would indicate poor masking or blending. The edges of the hat, beard, and cloak follow natural contours and integrate smoothly with the background. The background itself is a rendition of Van Gogh’s 'Starry Night,' which has strong contrast and dynamic movement, yet the figure stands out without any visual artifacts. This suggests either a high-quality composite or an original painting where the figure was conceived as part of the whole scene. The absence of compositing errors supports the integrity of the image’s construction.",

      "question": "Are the eyes, nose, and mouth aligned symmetrically and proportionally consistent with the original face, with no stretching or warping caused by adjacent edits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B—the eyes, nose, and mouth—are aligned symmetrically and proportionally consistent with a human face. The eyes are evenly spaced and level, with pupils centered within the irises. The nose is straight and centrally positioned, and the mouth is horizontally aligned with the base of the nose and chin. There is no visible distortion such as stretching, skewing, or disproportionate scaling that would suggest manipulation from adjacent areas (e.g., beard or hat adjustments). While the face has been stylized (with exaggerated features like the long mustache and intense gaze), the underlying proportions remain anatomically plausible. Comparing this to typical Renaissance-style portraits (such as those of Leonardo da Vinci), the symmetry and balance are preserved. The editing process, if any, did not compromise facial integrity. Therefore, the facial structure appears natural and unwarped.",
