      "question": "Are the person's arms and hands in a raised position that looks natural and consistent with their chibi-style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person's arms and hands are raised in a celebratory gesture. This pose is consistent with chibi-style art, which often exaggerates expressions and gestures for effect. The raised position appears natural within the context of the character's cheerful expression and the celebratory theme suggested by the 'Mega Meal' text. The proportions and angles of the arms and hands align well with typical chibi-style transformations, where limbs may be slightly oversized for emphasis.",

      "question": "Does the added text \"Level 6 · Mega Meal\" blend well with the background and does not introduce distracting artifacts or look unnaturally placed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added text 'Level 6 · Mega Meal' in Image B is placed above the table and uses a font style that contrasts subtly with the background while remaining legible. It does not introduce distracting artifacts or appear unnaturally placed. The text complements the playful and thematic elements of the image, such as the chibi figure and the meal setup, enhancing the overall visual narrative without disrupting it.",

      "question": "Do the burgers and fries on the table retain their realistic texture, detail, and shape, appearing as if they were untouched by the transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The burgers and fries on the table in Image B have been stylized to match the chibi aesthetic of the scene. While they retain some recognizable shapes, their texture and detail have been simplified to fit the cartoonish style. They no longer appear realistic but instead complement the whimsical nature of the chibi transformation. Comparing this to Image A, where the food items were detailed and realistic, it's clear that they have been altered to maintain consistency with the new artistic style.",

      "question": "Has the person been transformed into a chibi-style figure that maintains recognizable facial and body features without unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The person in Image B has been transformed into a chibi-style figure. The facial features are simplified and exaggerated, with large eyes and a small mouth, which are characteristic of chibi art. The body proportions have also been adjusted, with a larger head and smaller limbs, maintaining recognizable features like hair color and clothing style. There are no unnatural textures or loss of detail within the constraints of the chibi style.",

      "question": "Does the overall scene remain visually plausible, with the person now as a chibi-style collectible presented in a trendy acrylic standee character sheet format without any distorted elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall scene in Image B remains visually plausible despite the chibi transformation. The person is presented as a collectible figure in an acrylic standee format, which is a common way to display chibi characters. The scene retains coherence with the original setting, including the table and background, ensuring that the transformation does not introduce distorted elements. The combination of the chibi figure, the meal, and the text creates a cohesive and trendy presentation.",
