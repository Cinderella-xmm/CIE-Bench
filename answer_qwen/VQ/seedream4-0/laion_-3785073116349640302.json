      "question": "Are the chibi versions of Ultraman and the creature proportionally scaled with rounded, simplified features that maintain their identifiable characteristics without distorted limbs or facial structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi versions of Ultraman and the monster (resembling a kaiju like Gigan or similar) are stylized in a cute, simplified manner typical of chibi art. Their proportions are exaggerated with large heads, small bodies, and short limbs—hallmarks of chibi design. However, despite the simplification, key identifying features remain intact: Ultraman's iconic red and silver suit, yellow eyes, and chest light; the creature's bat-like wings, sharp teeth, and horned head. The limbs are not elongated or distorted but are appropriately shortened for the chibi style. Facial structures, though simplified, retain recognizable expressions—Ultraman has a calm, determined look, while the creature appears aggressive. This balance between simplification and recognition is consistent with standard chibi representation in collectibles and animation. No anatomical distortions such as bent limbs or misshapen faces are present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the chibi figures exhibit a consistent, smooth, glossy finish without visible texture breaks, uneven highlights, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figures inside the snow globe have a uniform, polished appearance. The surface of both Ultraman and the creature shows a consistent sheen, suggesting a high-gloss material such as plastic or resin commonly used in collectible figurines. There are no visible seams, texture breaks, or abrupt changes in surface quality. Highlights on the figures appear soft and diffused, consistent with lighting in a controlled studio environment. Reflections are subtle and follow natural light behavior—no overly sharp or artificial glares that would suggest digital manipulation or poor rendering. The smoothness of the surfaces enhances the toy-like aesthetic, which aligns with the intended presentation of collectible chibi models.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glittering dust particles evenly distributed in the air around the chibi figures, forming a soft, swirling motion that blends naturally with the background mist without clumping or artificial trails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the globe, there is a layer of fine, glittering particles suspended in the air. These particles are scattered throughout the space, creating a soft, ethereal effect. They appear to be gently swirling, likely due to the presence of mist or vapor within the globe, which adds depth and movement. The distribution is fairly even, with no obvious clumps or dense patches that would suggest poor dispersion. The interaction between the particles and the mist creates a natural-looking diffusion, enhancing the sense of atmosphere. There are no sharp trails or unnatural streaks that would indicate digital artifacts or forced motion. The overall effect mimics real snow or dust in a snow globe, where particles drift slowly and randomly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the outer globe clearly defined with a transparent spherical shape that contains all internal elements, and do the etched cosmic patterns on its surface appear correctly aligned and non-distorted across the curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outer globe is a clear, perfectly spherical enclosure that fully contains the chibi figures and atmospheric elements. Its transparency allows full visibility of the interior while maintaining structural integrity. The etched patterns—depicting stars, galaxies, and the title 'ULTRAMAN: THE TRIALS OF ULTRAMAN'—are precisely engraved on the glass surface. These designs follow the curvature of the sphere without distortion, indicating either careful craftsmanship or high-quality digital rendering. The text and celestial motifs remain legible and proportionally accurate when viewed from different angles, which suggests that the etching respects the spherical geometry. There is no warping, stretching, or misalignment that would occur if the design were poorly applied.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base feature detailed metallic debris and rugged terrain that support the scene's scale and contrast with the chibi figures, without floating or misplaced objects or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the snow globe is designed to resemble a rocky outcrop with realistic textures and depth, providing a grounded foundation for the globe. Scattered across this terrain are various pieces of metallic debris—such as broken gears, bolts, and mechanical fragments—that appear to be remnants of destroyed machinery. These objects are positioned in a way that suggests they have fallen naturally, with some partially embedded in the rock. The lighting is consistent across the scene: shadows fall logically based on the direction of the light source, and the metallic parts reflect light appropriately, showing specular highlights. There are no floating objects or items that seem disconnected from the base. The scale of the debris contrasts effectively with the small chibi figures above, reinforcing the idea of a post-battle landscape. Overall, the composition supports narrative depth and visual coherence.",
