    "Question": "Q1: Does the truck maintain its original proportions and structural integrity without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is rendered in a cartoon or stylized illustration format. Despite the artistic simplification, the overall proportions of the truck—such as the relative size of the cab, grille, wheels, and exhaust pipe—remain consistent with real-world semi-truck designs. The geometric shapes, such as the rectangular cab, circular wheels, and angular grille, are preserved and not distorted. There are no visible breaks, warped edges, or misaligned components that would suggest structural compromise. While the style is simplified, the core structure adheres to the expected form of a classic long-haul truck, maintaining logical spatial relationships between parts. Therefore, even in this stylized depiction, the truck retains its structural integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the surfaces and textures of the truck, such as the wheels, cab, and grille, free from unnatural artifacts and retain appropriate levels of detail?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the truck in a cartoon style, which inherently uses simplified textures and minimal shading compared to photorealistic rendering. However, the surfaces are clean and consistent with the artistic intent. The wheels have defined treads and hubcaps with symmetrical bolt patterns, which are logically represented for a stylized version. The cab has smooth, uniform red coloring with clear outlines, and the grille features vertical bars that are evenly spaced and aligned. Although the texture details are reduced (e.g., no fine scratches or reflections), there are no unnatural artifacts like pixelation, glitches, or inconsistent patterns. The level of detail is appropriate for the medium—cartoon illustration—and maintains visual coherence. Thus, while not realistic, the textures are intentional and free from errors.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the cab's vibrant colors appear natural against the truck's materials and lighting conditions, ensuring material consistency and avoiding unrealistic contrasts?",
    "explanation": "The cab in Image B is depicted in a bright red color, which is typical for many trucks and is visually consistent with common paint finishes. In cartoon illustrations, lighting is often simplified, but here the red is applied uniformly across the cab with subtle shading to suggest depth and light direction. The chrome elements (like the grille, bumper, and exhaust) reflect light appropriately in a stylized manner, using highlights and shadows that align with the assumed light source from above. There are no jarring color shifts or impossible reflections that would break material consistency. While the lighting is not photorealistic, it remains internally coherent within the cartoon aesthetic. The contrast between red and chrome is realistic for such vehicles and does not appear exaggerated or unnatural. Hence, the color application respects both material properties and artistic conventions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the simplified background naturally integrated with the truck, maintaining the overall authenticity of the scene without introducing distracting or out-of-place elements?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of stylized trees, grass, clouds, and a gravel road—all drawn in the same cartoon style as the truck. The integration between the truck and the environment is seamless, with no mismatched scale or perspective issues. The trees are proportionally sized relative to the truck, and the road curves naturally beneath the vehicle. The sky includes simple clouds that do not interfere with the composition. While the background lacks photorealistic detail, it supports the scene without introducing elements that clash with the truck’s presence. For example, there are no floating objects, incorrect shadows, or surreal features. The overall aesthetic is cohesive, and the simplification enhances clarity rather than detracting from authenticity within the context of a cartoon illustration. Thus, the background is appropriately integrated.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the wheels maintain their structural and physical logic, with no signs of distortion or misalignment, thereby preserving the truck's visual credibility?",
    "explanation": "The wheels in Image B are clearly depicted with correct circular geometry and proper alignment under the chassis. Each wheel has a consistent number of lug nuts arranged symmetrically around the hubcap, and the tires show appropriate tread patterns for a heavy-duty truck. The dual rear wheels are paired correctly and positioned parallel to each other, reflecting real-world truck design. There is no warping, stretching, or misalignment that would suggest physical impossibility. Even though the style is simplified, the wheels adhere to basic mechanical principles and remain visually credible within the cartoon framework. Their placement and proportions match the truck’s body, supporting the illusion of a functional vehicle. Therefore, the wheels preserve structural and physical logic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
