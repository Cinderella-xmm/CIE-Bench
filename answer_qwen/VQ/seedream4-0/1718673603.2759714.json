      "question": "Are the roof, walls, and window frames of the Japanese house replaced with colored glass panels outlined by black lead without distorting the original building’s geometry or introducing misaligned or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Japanese house is rendered in a stained glass art style. The roof, walls, and window frames are composed of colored glass segments outlined by black lead lines, which is characteristic of traditional stained glass design. The geometry of the building remains consistent with the original architectural form—its multi-tiered roof, layered eaves, and symmetrical structure are preserved. The panels follow the contours of the original building without introducing misaligned or broken lines. Each section of the roof and wall is segmented into geometric shapes that align with the building's structural elements, maintaining proportional accuracy. There is no visible distortion in the overall shape or layout of the house, indicating that the transformation into stained glass has been executed while respecting the original geometry.",

      "question": "Have the red trees on both sides of the house been converted into symmetrical floral motifs made of red and green glass segments that maintain their original placement and scale without unnatural stretching or fragmentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red trees on both sides of the house in Image B have been stylized into floral motifs composed of red and green glass segments. These motifs maintain their general placement relative to the house, as they are positioned symmetrically on either side, mirroring the original composition. However, the trees are not exact representations of natural foliage but rather abstracted into flower-like patterns with defined petals and leaves made from segmented glass. While the scale appears consistent with the surrounding architecture, the transformation involves significant artistic abstraction—leaves and branches are replaced with stylized floral shapes. This stylization does not involve unnatural stretching or fragmentation; instead, it uses geometric segmentation typical of stained glass art. The symmetry between the left and right trees is preserved, and their positions remain aligned with the original scene’s balance. Thus, although not literal representations, the trees retain their original spatial role and scale within the artwork.",

      "question": "Is the red moon represented as a series of concentric gradient circles in stained glass style, with smooth color transitions and no jagged edges or irregularities in its form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red moon in Image B is depicted as a series of concentric circles with varying shades of red and pink, forming a gradient effect. This design mimics the appearance of stained glass, where color transitions occur across segmented areas. The edges of each circular segment are smooth and well-defined, following the curvature of the moon without jaggedness or irregularities. The use of concentric rings creates a sense of depth and luminosity, consistent with how light might pass through layered glass. There are no visible breaks or distortions in the form of the moon, and its circular shape is maintained throughout. The transition from dark outer edges to brighter center suggests a deliberate gradient technique used in stained glass artistry. Therefore, the moon is accurately represented in stained glass style with smooth color transitions and intact form.",
