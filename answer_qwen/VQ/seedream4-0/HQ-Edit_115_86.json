      "question": "Does the tutu maintain a balanced, layered structure with no visible warping or collapsed sections that suggest digital distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tutu is rendered in a stylized, illustrative manner typical of digital art. The layers of the tutu are clearly defined and exhibit a symmetrical, fan-like spread that radiates outward from the waist. Each layer appears to be evenly spaced and maintains consistent curvature, suggesting careful design rather than distortion. There are no visible warping effects such as unnatural folds, collapses, or irregular bulges that would indicate digital artifacts. The overall shape is harmonious and proportionate, aligning with traditional ballet costume aesthetics. While it's stylized, the structure remains balanced and coherent, without signs of technical distortion.",

      "question": "Are the glitter elements seamlessly blended into the tutu and bodice, showing natural variation in size and brightness without pixelation or unnatural clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glitter elements on the tutu and bodice in Image B are depicted as small, sparkling highlights along the edges and central motifs. These elements vary slightly in size and brightness, creating a sense of depth and sparkle typical of decorative embellishments in ballet costumes. They are distributed in a patterned but not uniform way—some clusters appear denser near the center, while others are sparser at the edges, which mimics real-world sequin placement. There is no visible pixelation or blocky texture, and the sparkles are smoothly integrated into the fabric illustration. The rendering avoids clumping or unnatural clustering, maintaining an aesthetic balance. This suggests intentional artistic design rather than low-resolution or poorly processed digital effects.",

      "question": "Is the background gradient smooth and continuous, with no visible banding or abrupt color shifts that separate it from the subject’s silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a soft, pastel-colored background with a gentle gradient transitioning from light pink to white. The gradient appears smooth across the entire backdrop, with no visible banding, stair-stepping, or sharp transitions. The color shift is subtle and blends seamlessly into the surrounding floral borders. The subject (the ballerina) is clearly separated from the background by clean outlines, but there is no hard edge or chromatic separation between her silhouette and the background. The lighting on the figure is consistent with the ambient tone, and there are no halo effects or clipping artifacts. This indicates a well-executed digital gradient that enhances the image without introducing visual noise or discontinuity.",

      "question": "Are the blank message areas fully opaque and aligned with the image plane, with no visible edge artifacts or texture disruption beneath them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes two rectangular blank areas positioned behind the ballerina, likely intended for text or messages. These areas are uniformly white and appear fully opaque, meaning they cover the underlying background completely. Their edges are clean and straight, with no visible feathering, transparency, or ghosting that would suggest misalignment or layering issues. The texture of the background beneath these areas is consistent—no underlying patterns or gradients peek through—indicating proper masking or layering in the digital composition. The alignment is parallel to the floor and walls, consistent with the image plane. There are no visual disruptions, such as jagged lines or texture bleed, confirming that the blank areas are professionally integrated.",

      "question": "Do the floral motifs along the borders stay within the frame boundaries and maintain consistent scale and orientation without intersecting the ballerina or floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral motifs in Image B are arranged symmetrically along all four corners and edges of the frame. They are composed of soft pink and white flowers with green leaves, forming decorative borders. These elements are contained entirely within the outer edges of the image and do not encroach upon the ballerina or the wooden floor. Their scale is consistent across all sides, with no disproportionate enlargement or shrinking. The orientation of the flowers follows a natural, flowing arc that complements the frame without overlapping the subject. Importantly, none of the floral stems or petals cross into the main scene, preserving spatial clarity and preventing visual interference with the ballerina’s pose. This careful framing reflects deliberate artistic composition.",

      "question": "Do both hands show exactly five fingers each, with natural curvature and spacing, and no extra or fused digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands of the ballerina are illustrated in a graceful, arched position typical of ballet. Upon close inspection, each hand displays five distinct fingers: thumb, index, middle, ring, and little finger. The fingers are properly spaced, with natural curvature that matches human anatomy. There is no evidence of fused digits or extra fingers. The proportions and positioning are consistent with standard cartoon or anime-style drawing conventions, where anatomical accuracy is preserved even in stylized forms. The nails are subtly detailed, and the joints are implied correctly. No anomalies such as missing or duplicated fingers are present, indicating accurate representation.",

      "question": "Are both feet positioned correctly on pointe with natural arches and toes, and is the supporting leg aligned to sustain the posture without unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina is shown en pointe, with both feet placed on their toes. The right foot is fully extended forward on pointe, while the left foot supports the body weight. Both feet display natural arches and toe alignment consistent with classical ballet technique. The toes are pointed and evenly spaced, and the instep curves appropriately. The supporting leg (left leg) is straight and aligned vertically, providing stability without any visible unnatural bending or joint distortion. The calf muscles are drawn with correct tension, and the overall posture reflects balance and control. While stylized, the depiction adheres to realistic biomechanics of ballet, avoiding exaggerated or impossible angles.",
