      "question": "Does the enlarged skirt maintain consistent lace texture and pattern without visible warping, tiling, or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skirt appears to have been enlarged. Observing the lace texture and pattern, there is no visible warping or tiling that would suggest an unnatural stretching. The lace maintains its intricate design consistently across the expanded area. This conclusion is drawn by examining the continuity of the lace pattern and ensuring it aligns logically with how fabric typically behaves when extended.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the enhanced lace details consistent in thickness, spacing, and opacity with the original lace, and do they lack abrupt edges or synthetic-looking overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The enhanced lace details in Image B appear consistent in thickness, spacing, and opacity compared to what one would expect from a natural lace material. There are no abrupt edges or synthetic-looking overlays disrupting the texture. Comparing this with Image A, the lace retains its delicate appearance without any noticeable alterations that would indicate artificial enhancement.",

      "question": "Do the added structural elements of the camper van conversion (e.g., side panels, windows) follow the car’s existing geometry and maintain consistent scale and perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added structural elements of the camper van conversion in Image B seem to follow the car’s existing geometry well. They maintain a consistent scale and perspective relative to the rest of the vehicle. This assessment is based on observing how these new elements integrate seamlessly with the original car structure without appearing out of place or disproportionate.",

      "question": "Are the floral paintings applied smoothly across the car’s curved surfaces without flatness, misalignment, or unnatural shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral paintings on the car in Image B are applied smoothly across the curved surfaces. There is no evidence of flatness, misalignment, or unnatural shadowing that would detract from the realistic appearance. The flowers blend naturally with the contours of the car, suggesting careful attention to detail in their application.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the kraft paper texture uniformly applied across the background without obscuring the subject or creating visible seams, and are the nautical borders contained within the image boundaries without cutting into the woman or car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kraft paper texture in Image B is uniformly applied across the background, not obscuring the subject or creating visible seams. The nautical borders are neatly contained within the image boundaries, avoiding intrusion into the woman or car. This indicates a thoughtful integration of the frame elements with the photograph.",

      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the woman’s dress, car, and added elements align with the original overhead sunlight source and show no conflicting highlights or dark spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadows on the woman’s dress, car, and added elements in Image B align well with the overhead sunlight source. There are no conflicting highlights or dark spots that would disrupt the natural lighting effect. This consistency suggests that the editing process maintained the original lighting conditions effectively.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman’s right hand resting on the car hood in Image B shows five distinct fingers with natural joint angles and skin texture. Her feet are properly aligned with the sandals without any deformation.
