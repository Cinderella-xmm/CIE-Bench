      "question": "Does the person's face retain its structural coherence with natural shading and texture in the soft illustration style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person's face is rendered in a soft illustration style that uses smooth gradients and gentle color transitions to mimic natural skin tones. The facial features—eyes, nose, mouth, and cheeks—are proportionally accurate and maintain anatomical coherence. Shading is applied subtly around the jawline, under the chin, and near the eyes, suggesting depth without harsh lines, which aligns with typical techniques used in digital illustrations to create a lifelike yet stylized appearance. The texture appears consistent with a painted or watercolor-like effect, avoiding pixelation or distortion. This style preserves the natural structure of the face while enhancing it with artistic softness, indicating that the illustration maintains both structural integrity and aesthetic harmony.",

      "question": "Are the teddy bears, including their shirts' text and proportions, depicted coherently and naturally in the soft illustration style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teddy bears in Image B are illustrated with soft edges and consistent fur texture, maintaining their recognizable form and relative proportions. Each bear has distinct coloring and features (e.g., one wears a red hat), and their sizes appear balanced and proportional to each other and to the person holding them. The red shirts they wear have legible text—phrases like 'thinking of you makes me smile,' 'BEST FRIEND REV', and 'COULD YOU USE A HUG TODAY?'—which are clearly readable despite the illustrative style. The lettering follows natural curvature and spacing, consistent with how text would appear on clothing in an artistic rendering. There are no distortions or misalignments in the text or body shapes, and the overall depiction remains coherent and visually plausible within the chosen soft art style.",

      "question": "Does the handwritten text at the top appear naturally integrated into the image without introducing visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handwritten-style text 'Some friends come with hugs' is placed at the top of Image B in a flowing, cursive font that matches the warm, sentimental tone of the scene. The color of the text (a muted brown) harmonizes with the beige background and the overall color palette, ensuring it does not stand out jarringly. There are no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or layering inconsistencies that would suggest digital artifacting. The text blends smoothly into the composition, appearing as if it were part of the original illustration rather than an afterthought. Its placement above the subject enhances the emotional message without obstructing key visual elements, contributing to a cohesive and polished design.",

      "question": "Does the beige sofa maintain its natural texture and color, contributing to the warm and cozy tone of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beige sofa in Image B is rendered with soft, blended strokes that simulate fabric texture, such as subtle creases and cushioned padding. The color is consistent with a warm beige, slightly tinted toward cream, which complements the overall soft and inviting atmosphere of the illustration. The lighting suggests a gentle source from above, casting soft shadows that enhance the three-dimensionality of the sofa’s backrest and seat. While stylized, the texture avoids over-simplification or unnatural flatness; instead, it retains enough detail to convey comfort and realism within the illustrative context. This contributes effectively to the warm, cozy mood intended by the artwork.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition, including the person, teddy bears, and added text, preserve visual credibility and a warm, cozy atmosphere in the soft illustration style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition of Image B successfully balances all elements—the person, the teddy bears, the sofa, and the textual overlay—within a unified soft illustration style. The person is centrally positioned, creating a focal point, while the teddy bears are arranged symmetrically in her arms, reinforcing a sense of warmth and affection. The color scheme—dominated by beiges, reds, and soft browns—evokes comfort and intimacy. The addition of the handwritten text enhances the emotional narrative without disrupting the visual flow. All components are stylistically consistent, with no abrupt transitions or dissonant elements. The result is a credible, emotionally resonant image that achieves its goal of conveying coziness and friendship through thoughtful artistic choices.",
