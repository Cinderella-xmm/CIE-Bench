      "question": "Are the facial features added over the star motif proportionally aligned and integrated without distorting the star’s shape or creating unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a cartoon-style human face has been superimposed onto the upper chest area of the jersey, directly overlapping the white star motif. The facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) are positioned such that they appear to be emerging from behind the collar, with the star located just below the chin area. However, the star's shape is not visibly distorted—its five-pointed geometry remains intact. The edges of the face blend into the jersey background with soft transitions, and there is no visible clipping or jaggedness around the star itself. The face appears as a layered graphic element rather than a physical modification of the jersey, so it does not alter the star’s form. Given that the star is preserved in its original shape and alignment, and no warping or edge artifacts are present, the integration can be considered proportional and clean.",

      "question": "Do the motion lines surrounding the character have smooth, consistent strokes that align with the jersey's design language and do not exhibit pixelation or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motion lines in Image B are stylized, curved streaks radiating outward from the left side of the character, suggesting movement. These lines are rendered in shades of gray and blue, matching the jersey’s color scheme. Upon close inspection, the lines have clean, vector-like edges without visible pixelation or jaggedness, indicating high-resolution rendering. They follow a dynamic arc pattern that complements the energetic theme of cycling, and their thickness and spacing are consistent. There is no evidence of clipping artifacts—such as misaligned pixels or missing segments—suggesting proper layering and compositing. The style of these lines also echoes the geometric patterns on the jersey (e.g., the diagonal 'DALLAS' text and grid motifs), reinforcing a cohesive visual language. Therefore, the motion lines are smoothly integrated and professionally executed.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all newly added elements (facial features, motion lines, tagline) rendered using only the original jersey’s color scheme (blue, white, red, gray), with no unintended color bleed or mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original jersey in Image A uses a palette of blue, white, red, and gray, which is clearly maintained in Image B. The facial features use skin tones (not part of the original palette), but this is acceptable as they are a character addition and not part of the jersey fabric. However, the motion lines are rendered in varying shades of gray and blue, consistent with the jersey’s design. The tagline 'Ride Like a Star!' uses dark blue text with a white outline, both of which are within the original color scheme. There is no visible color bleed—no unwanted blending or halo effects around the edges of the added elements. The skin tone of the face is distinct but isolated, not contaminating adjacent areas. While the face introduces new colors (like flesh tones), the question specifies 'only the original jersey’s color scheme,' which would exclude non-original hues. Since the face contains non-original colors, this could violate the condition. However, the question asks whether *all* newly added elements are rendered using *only* the original colors. Since the face includes skin tones not in the original palette, the answer must reflect this deviation. Thus, the requirement is not fully met.",

      "question": "Is the tagline \"Ride Like a Star!\" positioned diagonally in the bottom-left corner without overlapping or obscuring existing text or graphics, and is it clearly readable without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tagline 'Ride Like a Star!' is placed in the bottom-left quadrant of the image, angled diagonally upward from left to right. It does not overlap with the word 'DALLAS' on the front of the jersey, nor does it cover any critical design elements like the star or the 'YOUR NAME' placeholder. The text is large enough to be legible and uses a bold sans-serif font with clear contrast against the background. There is no blurring, distortion, or anti-aliasing issues that would impair readability. The placement is strategic, enhancing the visual appeal without interfering with the jersey’s primary branding. Based on visual inspection, the tagline is cleanly rendered and well-positioned.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the fabric texture of the jersey, including the repeated \"DALLAS\" pattern and mesh-like sections, remain intact and undistorted even in areas near the added facial features and motion lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fabric texture of the jersey—including the subtle repeating 'DALLAS' watermark and the gray geometric mesh patterns on the lower right—is visible throughout Image B. In regions near the facial features and motion lines, the underlying texture appears continuous and unaltered. There is no stretching, warping, or pixelation of the pattern beneath the overlaid elements. The facial feature is a transparent overlay, allowing the jersey’s print to show through where appropriate. Similarly, the motion lines are translucent and do not obscure or distort the fabric details underneath. This suggests that the editing process preserved the integrity of the original jersey texture, likely by using layer masks or transparency effects. Therefore, the textile design remains consistent and undistorted.",
