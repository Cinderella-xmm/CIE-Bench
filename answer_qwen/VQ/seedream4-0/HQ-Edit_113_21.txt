    "Question": "Q1: Does the woman’s body posture while leaning against the hut appear physically plausible, with correct alignment of limbs and no unnatural bending or floating?",
    "explanation": "In the top-left postcard of Image B, the woman is depicted leaning against a thatched hut. Her posture shows her standing upright with one hand resting on her hip and the other holding a walking stick. Her legs are positioned naturally, with weight distributed appropriately for balance. The angle of her torso relative to the hut suggests a relaxed yet stable lean. There is no visible distortion in limb alignment—her arms, legs, and spine follow anatomically plausible curves. The use of shading and perspective supports a grounded stance, with her feet firmly planted on the ground. Based on visual cues and common knowledge of human biomechanics, this posture appears physically plausible. There is no indication of floating limbs or unnatural bends. This assessment is consistent with typical representations of elderly individuals in traditional settings, where support from a cane and partial reliance on a structure like a hut are common.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the abstracted beaded jewelry elements rendered with smooth transitions and consistent geometric patterns, without visible artifacts such as blurring or distorted shapes?",
    "explanation": "In the top-right postcard of Image B, the woman's beaded jewelry is highly stylized, featuring multiple layers of necklaces composed of brightly colored, geometrically patterned beads. The rendering uses a mosaic-like, digital art style with sharp edges and vivid color blocks. While the design is abstract and not photorealistic, the transitions between colors and shapes are clean and deliberate. Each bead appears as a distinct, uniform shape within a larger repeating pattern, suggesting intentional artistic consistency. There are no visible signs of blurring, pixelation, or distortion—each element maintains its form and placement. The geometric patterns are symmetrical and aligned across the necklace tiers, which indicates careful digital construction. Given that this is an artistic interpretation rather than a photograph, the absence of artifacts and the presence of structured, coherent patterns suggest high-quality rendering. Therefore, despite abstraction, the jewelry elements are well-executed with smooth transitions and consistent patterns.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the silhouette of the woman cleanly separated from the background with no jagged edges, ghosting, or misaligned contours?",
    "explanation": "In the bottom postcard of Image B, the woman is shown as a black silhouette against a vibrant, stylized landscape. The outline of her figure is sharply defined, with smooth, continuous contours that follow the natural shape of her body, including her head, shoulders, arms, and legs. The silhouette is set against a gradient sky and a field of green grass, both of which do not bleed into the figure’s edges. There are no visible jagged lines, anti-aliasing errors, or ghosting effects that would suggest poor masking or clipping. The transition from the silhouette to the background is abrupt but clean, indicating precise vector-based or high-resolution raster cutting. In digital art, especially stylized silhouettes, such clean separation is often achieved through path tracing or layer masking. The absence of any visual artifacts confirms that the silhouette has been professionally isolated from the background.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the geometric borders applied consistently around each postcard without overlapping or distorting the main subject or background elements?",
    "explanation": "Each of the three postcards in Image B features a colorful, geometric border composed of triangular and rectangular shapes in bright hues. These borders frame the images uniformly and are evenly spaced around the edges of each card. The borders do not intrude into the central subject matter—there is no overlap onto the woman’s clothing, face, or the background elements such as the hut or grassland. The spacing between the border and the image content remains consistent across all three cards, suggesting a standardized design template. Furthermore, the borders maintain their shape and color integrity without warping or distorting the underlying image. The use of a white mat between the border and the image further enhances clarity and prevents any visual interference. This consistent application reflects good graphic design practice, ensuring that the borders enhance rather than obscure the content.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the patterns and textures on the woman’s traditional clothing appear continuous and undistorted across all three versions, with no unexpected highlights or material shifts?",
    "explanation": "Across the three postcards in Image B, the woman’s traditional clothing is depicted in different styles: full-body in the top-left, close-up facial and jewelry detail in the top-right, and as a silhouette in the bottom. In the top-left and top-right images, the clothing features intricate patterns with geometric motifs, bright colors, and layered textures that resemble woven fabrics and beadwork. These patterns are consistent in style and continuity—no sudden breaks, distortions, or material shifts are observed. The same design language is used across both images, indicating a unified artistic vision. However, in the bottom silhouette, the clothing details are absent due to the black fill, which is expected in a silhouette representation. There are no unexpected highlights or reflections in the colored versions; lighting is flat and stylized, appropriate for the graphic nature of the artwork. Thus, while the texture cannot be seen in the silhouette, the patterns in the two detailed images remain intact and coherent. The consistency in design and absence of visual anomalies confirm that the patterns are properly maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
