      "question": "Does the quilt display uniform square blocks with visible grid lines and a matte finish consistent with LEGO bricks, without any fabric-like folds or stitching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt appears to be composed of uniform square blocks with visible grid lines and a matte finish that is characteristic of LEGO bricks. There are no fabric-like folds or stitching present, which aligns with the appearance of LEGO construction. The visual cues such as the blocky texture and consistent pattern suggest a LEGO design rather than a traditional fabric quilt.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the round sports elements (e.g., football, soccer ball) represented as circular LEGO tiles with consistent size and alignment within the square grid, without stretching or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The round sports elements on the quilt in Image B are depicted as circular LEGO tiles embedded within the square grid. They maintain consistent size and alignment without any stretching or deformation, fitting seamlessly into the LEGO aesthetic. This representation adheres to the typical LEGO design principles where circular pieces are used to depict rounded objects.",

      "question": "Is the pillow replaced by a cube composed of stacked LEGO bricks with equal dimensions on all sides, right angles, and no visible gaps or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pillow in Image B has been replaced by a cube made up of stacked LEGO bricks. The cube exhibits equal dimensions on all sides, right angles, and no visible gaps or misalignments between the bricks, which is consistent with how LEGO structures are typically built. This replacement maintains the LEGO theme throughout the image.",

      "question": "Is the bed base a flat, white, seamless surface with no visible wood grain, shadows, or depth cues, resembling a standard LEGO baseplate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bed base in Image B is a flat, white, seamless surface that resembles a standard LEGO baseplate. It lacks any wood grain, shadows, or depth cues that would suggest a physical material like wood. This design choice supports the overall LEGO aesthetic of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire background a smooth, uniform white surface with no visible walls, furniture, or windows, and are there no shadows or lighting gradients indicating a physical space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a smooth, uniform white surface with no visible walls, furniture, windows, or other environmental features. There are also no shadows or lighting gradients that would indicate a physical space. This minimalist approach enhances the focus on the LEGO-themed elements in the foreground.",
