      "question": "Does the glass container maintain the original circular shape and proportions of the compass body, with no warped edges or irregular thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object is a glass container designed to resemble a compass. The outer rim of the glass appears circular and symmetrical, consistent with the typical round shape of a compass. Upon close inspection, the edges of the glass are smooth and uniform in thickness, showing no signs of warping or distortion. The glass maintains a consistent curvature throughout its perimeter, which aligns with the expected proportions of a traditional compass body. There are no visible bulges, dents, or asymmetries that would suggest irregularity in thickness. This suggests that the design has preserved the original circular geometry while adapting it into a transparent glass form. Based on visual cues and common design principles for such objects, the shape is accurately maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the spray nozzle centered within the glass container, aligned with the pivot point of the original needle, and does it have a smooth, continuous metallic surface without jagged edges or textural inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spray nozzle in Image B is positioned directly above the center of the compass face, where the original needle's pivot point would be located. This alignment ensures symmetry and functional integration with the compass design. The nozzle itself is metallic and cylindrical, with a polished finish. Its surface appears smooth and continuous, with no visible jagged edges or textural breaks. The transition from the nozzle base to the cap is seamless, and the material reflects light uniformly, indicating a consistent texture. In real-world manufacturing, such components are typically machined to precision, and the visual evidence here supports this level of craftsmanship. Therefore, both alignment and surface quality meet high standards.",

      "question": "Does the cap feature a detailed engraving of a vintage map that is evenly distributed across its surface, with no blurred lines or inconsistent depth, and is it attached seamlessly to the top of the glass container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap on top of the glass container in Image B displays an intricate engraving resembling a vintage map, complete with lines, latitude/longitude markings, and decorative elements typical of old cartography. The engraving is evenly spread across the cap’s surface, with clear, sharp lines and consistent depth, suggesting high-quality detailing. There are no visible blurring or uneven etching patterns. The cap is securely and seamlessly attached to the top of the glass container, forming a tight seal without gaps or misalignment. The connection between the cap and the glass appears flush and professional, reinforcing the idea of a well-integrated design. This level of detail and attachment is consistent with premium product design, especially in luxury or themed items like perfumes or collectibles.",

      "question": "Is the bronze gradient applied smoothly across the glass container and cap, with subtle variations in tone that simulate wear and light reflection, and no sharp color boundaries or artificial sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bronze-colored metal elements in Image B—both the outer ring of the glass container and the cap—display a gradient that mimics natural aging and lighting effects. The tonal shifts are gradual and realistic, with darker areas in shadowed regions and lighter highlights reflecting ambient light. These transitions are smooth, without abrupt edges or harsh color boundaries, which would indicate poor rendering. The surface exhibits a matte-to-slight-gloss finish that avoids artificial shine, enhancing the authentic, aged appearance. Such gradients are commonly used in high-end product design to convey depth and realism. The absence of unnatural reflections or digital artifacts further supports the conclusion that the bronze finish is well-executed.",

      "question": "Is the branding text visible along the outer rim of the glass container, with consistent font size and spacing, and does it appear embedded into the surface without overlapping or floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Along the outer rim of the glass container in Image B, there is text engraved in a circular fashion. The letters are clearly visible and follow a consistent font style, size, and spacing, maintaining uniformity around the circumference. The text appears to be etched or embossed into the metal surface rather than superimposed digitally, as it follows the contour of the rim and integrates naturally with the material. There is no evidence of floating or overlapping characters; each letter sits flush with the surrounding surface. This embedding technique is typical in premium branding, where legibility and aesthetic harmony are prioritized. The placement and execution suggest careful design and manufacturing attention to detail.",
