    "Question": "Q1: Are the body shapes of both elephants smoothly transformed into curved bottle forms without visible breaks or unnatural bends in their silhouettes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephants' bodies are seamlessly integrated into the shape of perfume bottles. The transition from the elephant's head to the bottle body is smooth and continuous, with no abrupt changes or breaks in the silhouette. This suggests a deliberate design choice to maintain an elegant and cohesive form. The curves follow a natural flow that aligns with the contours of an elephant's body.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the elephant ears appear as gold-trimmed bottle caps with smooth edges and no misalignment or deformation compared to the rest of the structure?",
    "explanation": "The ears of the elephants in Image B are designed as bottle caps with gold trim. They have smooth edges and are aligned properly with the rest of the bottle structure. There is no visible deformation or misalignment, indicating a well-executed design where the ears serve both as functional caps and decorative elements consistent with the overall aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the glittering texture on the backs of the elephants replaced with a clear, evenly distributed glass mosaic pattern that reflects light naturally without artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the backs of the elephants feature a glass mosaic pattern instead of a glittering texture. The mosaics are evenly distributed and reflect light naturally, creating a sparkling effect. There are no visible artifacts or irregularities in the pattern, suggesting a high-quality finish that enhances the visual appeal of the bottles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the brand logo and fragrance name label clearly visible along the trunks without stretching, warping, or overlapping with other features?",
    "explanation": "The brand logo and fragrance name labels in Image B are placed along the trunks of the elephants. They are clearly visible and legible, with no signs of stretching or warping. The placement ensures that they do not overlap with other features, maintaining clarity and readability while contributing to the overall design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the gold trim, glass mosaic patterns, and bottle surfaces exhibit consistent lighting and reflection behavior that aligns with real-world material properties?",
    "explanation": "The gold trim, glass mosaic patterns, and bottle surfaces in Image B display consistent lighting and reflection behavior. The gold trim reflects light in a manner typical of metallic materials, while the glass mosaics and bottle surfaces exhibit reflections and refractions consistent with glass. This consistency in material properties enhances the realism and quality of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
