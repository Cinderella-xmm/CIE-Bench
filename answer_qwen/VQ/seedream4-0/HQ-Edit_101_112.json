      "question": "Does the kimono display consistent, non-distorted fabric folds with visible, harmonious pattern details that align with the woodblock print aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono is rendered in a style consistent with traditional Japanese woodblock prints (ukiyo-e). The fabric folds are stylized rather than realistic, with clean, angular lines and minimal distortion. The pattern on the kimono features geometric and floral motifs typical of such art forms, including repeating designs in red, blue, and gold, which are harmoniously distributed across the garment. These patterns are clearly defined and follow the contours of the kimono without warping or unnatural stretching. In woodblock prints, fabric is often depicted with simplified but deliberate folds to convey form and texture, and this image adheres to that convention. The use of bold outlines and flat color areas further supports the aesthetic of woodblock printing. Compared to Image A, where the kimono is more realistically rendered with soft shadows and natural folds, Image B’s version emphasizes graphic clarity and stylistic simplification, which is appropriate for its artistic medium.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossom petals in the air and on the ground evenly distributed with clear, non-overlapping edges and consistent size variation typical of stylized woodblock art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossom petals are depicted in a manner consistent with the stylized approach of woodblock prints. They are scattered both in the air and on the ground, with a relatively even distribution that avoids dense clustering. Each petal has a clean, distinct outline, and there is no overlapping or blurring between them, which is characteristic of the line-based technique used in ukiyo-e. The size variation among the petals is moderate and follows a pattern typical of stylized representations—smaller petals near the viewer and slightly larger ones in the distance, suggesting depth without realism. This contrasts with Image A, where petals appear more randomly dispersed and have softer edges due to photographic realism. The controlled, uniform appearance in Image B reflects the intentional design choices common in woodblock art, where every element is carefully placed to maintain visual harmony.",

      "question": "Is the matte texture applied uniformly across the entire image without obscuring facial features, fabric patterns, or the basket’s weave structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a subtle matte texture that mimics the surface quality of aged paper commonly seen in traditional woodblock prints. This texture is applied consistently across the entire image, including the background, sky, water, and foreground elements. However, it does not obscure key details such as the facial features of the elderly woman, the intricate patterns on her kimono, or the woven structure of the basket. The texture enhances the vintage feel without compromising legibility or clarity. For example, the fine lines of the basket’s weave remain visible despite the overall texture, and the facial wrinkles and expression are still discernible. In contrast, Image A has a smoother, more polished finish typical of digital photography, lacking any such textural overlay. The application of the matte effect in Image B is therefore well-balanced and serves the artistic intent without detracting from important visual information.",

      "question": "Does the basket preserve its cylindrical shape and handle structure with visible, coherent weaving lines, even if simplified?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The basket in Image B maintains a clear cylindrical form with a rounded top and a defined handle arching over the rim. The weaving lines are visible and follow a consistent, interlaced pattern typical of wicker baskets, though they are stylized and simplified to fit the woodblock print aesthetic. The lines are evenly spaced and do not distort or break at any point, preserving the structural integrity of the object. While the detail level is lower than in a photorealistic depiction (as seen in Image A), the essential geometry and craftsmanship of the basket are accurately represented within the constraints of the artistic style. The coherence of the weave suggests careful attention to form, even in abstraction. This aligns with how objects are typically rendered in ukiyo-e, where functionality and recognizable shape are prioritized over hyper-detailed realism.",

      "question": "Do the hands show five fingers per hand with natural joint alignment and no extra digits or unnatural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the elderly woman are positioned in her lap, palms facing upward, with fingers gently folded together. Each hand clearly shows five fingers, and the joints are aligned in a way that reflects natural human anatomy. There are no extra digits, and the curvature of the fingers appears consistent with relaxed posture. The rendering is stylized but anatomically plausible, with slight exaggeration in the knuckles and finger length typical of woodblock art. The lines defining the fingers are smooth and continuous, avoiding any unnatural bends or distortions. In comparison to Image A, where the hands may appear more lifelike due to shading and skin texture, Image B's hands are simplified yet still accurate in count and structure. Given the artistic conventions of ukiyo-e, where figures are often idealized but not distorted, the representation here is acceptable and correct.",
