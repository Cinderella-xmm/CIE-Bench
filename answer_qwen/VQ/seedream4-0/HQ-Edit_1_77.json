      "question": "Are the facial features and body proportions of the central figure preserved and undistorted despite the artistic transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure retains a strong resemblance to the original in terms of facial structure—eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline are clearly defined and proportionally consistent with human anatomy. The artistic transformation introduces an oil painting style with visible brushstrokes, but these do not distort the underlying facial features. The symmetry of the face remains intact, and the proportions of the head relative to the torso appear balanced. The eyes are large and expressive, but their placement and size remain anatomically plausible. While the style is painterly, the core structural elements are preserved. Comparing this to Image A (the original), which appears more photorealistic, the transformation in Image B maintains the same facial layout and body proportions, suggesting that the artistic rendering did not introduce distortion. This conclusion is supported by the fact that even in stylized or painted representations, artists often preserve fundamental proportions for realism and recognition.",

      "question": "Are the added Maasai motifs on the blue garment aligned with the fabric's folds and free from jagged edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue garment in Image B now features intricate geometric patterns resembling traditional Maasai designs, particularly along the front panel. These motifs are rendered with bold lines and symmetrical shapes, including triangles and diamond patterns, typical of Maasai art. However, upon close inspection, the patterns appear slightly disconnected from the natural flow of the fabric’s folds. The lines of the design seem to be overlaid rather than integrated into the draping of the cloth, creating a sense of discontinuity. Additionally, some edges of the motifs exhibit slight jaggedness due to the painterly brushwork, especially where the pattern intersects with the folds. In contrast, Image A shows a simpler, plain blue garment without any such motifs. The addition in Image B enhances cultural representation but lacks seamless integration with the fabric’s texture and movement. Therefore, while the motifs are stylistically coherent, they are not perfectly aligned with the fabric’s folds and contain minor imperfections in line continuity.",

      "question": "Do the glowing elements on the bead ornaments emit light in a controlled manner without creating halos or color bleed onto the skin or fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes luminous elements within the bead ornaments, particularly on the central vertical strand of the neckpiece and possibly on the arm bands. These glowing points emit a warm, golden light that appears intentional and symbolic, possibly representing spiritual or ceremonial significance. However, the glow is not contained; it creates soft halos around the beads, extending into the surrounding areas of the skin and fabric. This effect causes a subtle color bleed, especially noticeable on the neck and upper chest where the light diffuses beyond the intended boundaries. While this might be an artistic choice to emphasize the sacred nature of the ornaments, it violates the principle of controlled illumination. In comparison, Image A has no glowing elements—everything is realistically lit by ambient daylight. Thus, the addition in Image B introduces visual artifacts that disrupt the clarity of the figure’s form. The glow, though aesthetically striking, lacks precision and control.",

      "question": "Are the brush strokes in the background evenly applied and do they preserve the correct shapes and positions of trees, terrain, and horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is rendered in an impressionistic oil painting style, characterized by visible brushstrokes and vibrant color blending. While the overall composition of the savanna landscape—with scattered acacia-like trees, rolling terrain, and distant mountains—is recognizable, the application of brushstrokes varies in consistency. Some areas, particularly the foreground grasses and midground trees, show thick, expressive strokes that distort the precise outlines of individual plants and shrubs. The horizon line remains relatively stable, but the transition between sky and land is softened, losing sharp definition. In contrast, Image A presents a photorealistic background where each tree and terrain feature is sharply delineated. The artistic transformation in Image B sacrifices detail for mood and texture, resulting in a less accurate representation of spatial relationships and object forms. Although the scene remains identifiable, the uneven stroke application and abstraction of shapes indicate a departure from fidelity.",

      "question": "Are the bead ornaments on the neck, arms, and headpiece fully intact with no missing, duplicated, or warped segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bead ornaments in Image B—including the elaborate neckpiece, arm bands, and headpiece—are richly detailed and visually striking. Upon close examination, the neckpiece consists of multiple concentric layers of red, blue, white, and yellow beads, arranged symmetrically. The arm bands follow a similar pattern, and the headpiece features dangling strands and decorative elements. However, there are subtle inconsistencies: some bead strands on the neck appear slightly misaligned or fragmented, particularly near the center where the vertical red thread runs down. The headpiece also shows minor asymmetry in the arrangement of hanging beads. Additionally, the brushwork may obscure fine details, making it difficult to confirm perfect continuity. Compared to Image A, where the beads are cleanly rendered and uniformly spaced, Image B’s painted version introduces slight warping due to the texture of the paint. While most elements are present, the artistic interpretation results in minor distortions and gaps in the beadwork, indicating that the ornaments are not fully intact in a technical sense.",
