    "Question": "Q1: Do the enlarged shopping bags retain their original geometric shapes without distorted edges or broken polygons?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shopping bags have been significantly altered with a geometric, faceted design composed of colorful triangular and polygonal patterns. These modifications give the bags a stylized, almost origami-like appearance. While the overall form of the bags remains recognizable as shopping bags, their edges are now sharp and angular, consistent with the applied geometric pattern. There are no visible broken polygons or jagged distortions in the structure—each facet appears cleanly rendered and properly aligned. The transformation is intentional and artistic, not accidental or flawed. Therefore, despite being stylized, the bags maintain coherent geometric integrity without visual errors such as distorted edges or broken polygons.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the velvety texture on the coat uniformly applied without unnatural shine or inconsistent surface details?",
    "explanation": "The coat in Image B exhibits a rich, deep red color with a pronounced velvety texture. This texture is consistent across the entire garment, with soft shadows and subtle highlights that suggest a plush fabric. However, upon closer inspection, there are areas—particularly along the collar and shoulders—where the lighting creates an overly reflective sheen that does not align with typical velvet behavior under natural sunlight. Velvet tends to absorb light rather than reflect it sharply, so these bright, specular highlights appear artificial and inconsistent with the material's expected properties. Additionally, some regions show a slightly uneven surface quality, possibly due to digital enhancement, which breaks the uniformity of the texture. Thus, while the general impression is velvety, the application includes unnatural shine and minor inconsistencies.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the glossy gloves visually consistent in shape and reflection, with no distorted finger joints or misplaced highlights?",
    "explanation": "The black gloves in Image B appear to be made of a shiny, leather-like material. Their shape is anatomically accurate, with clearly defined fingers and joints. The reflections on the gloves are smooth and follow the curvature of the hand, suggesting a consistent glossiness. There are no visible distortions in the finger joints—each knuckle and fingertip maintains natural proportions. Highlights are placed logically based on the direction of the light source (from above), creating realistic specular reflections. The rendering of the gloves shows attention to detail, with no signs of misaligned or misplaced highlights. Therefore, the gloves remain visually consistent and well-rendered.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the abstract retail symbols positioned around the subject without overlapping or intersecting with her body or shopping bags?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, various abstract retail icons—such as shopping bags, shoes, drinks, calendars, and geometric shapes—are arranged in a border-like fashion around the central figure. These symbols are placed at a distance from the woman and her shopping bags, generally avoiding direct overlap. However, some icons, particularly near the top left and bottom right corners, appear to be positioned very close to the edges of the shopping bags. While they do not physically intersect with her body, one icon (a blue and yellow shopping bag) is partially obscured by the edge of a real shopping bag, indicating a slight intersection. Moreover, the placement seems deliberately framed, but the proximity suggests potential clipping or layering issues. Given that even partial overlap counts as intersection in visual composition, this indicates a failure to fully avoid contact.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the open panel for personal messages blend seamlessly into the background with matching lighting and texture?",
    "explanation": "The large white panel behind the woman in Image B resembles an open notebook or message board. It has a clean, flat surface with faint horizontal lines and a small handwritten-style text 'Thank.' The panel is set against a plain off-white background that matches the surrounding wall. However, the lighting on the panel is noticeably different from the rest of the scene—it appears brighter and more evenly lit than the ambient environment, which casts soft shadows on the woman and her clothing. Additionally, the texture of the panel is smoother and lacks the subtle imperfections and depth present in the actual wall surface. This discrepancy in lighting and texture creates a clear separation between the panel and its surroundings, making it stand out rather than blend in. Therefore, the panel does not integrate seamlessly into the background.",
    "answer": "No"
