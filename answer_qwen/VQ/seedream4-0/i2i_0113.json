      "question": "Does the character's face maintain its natural appearance and texture while integrated into the soft vinyl material without visible unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's face appears smooth and lacks fine details that would typically be present in a natural human texture. The skin seems uniformly matte, which is characteristic of soft vinyl figures. There are no visible seams or distortions around the face, suggesting it has been well-integrated into the figure. This analysis combines visual cues with knowledge of how vinyl materials typically render facial textures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the character's body proportions and posture logically consistent and visually credible within the form of a soft vinyl figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B exhibits proportionally realistic limbs and torso for a human figure, maintaining a stance that suggests readiness and balance. The posture is upright and stable, typical of action figure designs meant to convey strength and agility. Comparing this with common soft vinyl figure standards, the proportions appear logical and credible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the character's suit retained its detailed textures and material realism without introduction of unnatural artifacts in the soft vinyl figure design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suit in Image B shows clear lines and patterns that mimic fabric and leather textures, such as stitching and paneling. These details align with what one would expect from a high-quality vinyl figure. There are no apparent glitches or inconsistencies that disrupt the realism of the suit's design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the interchangeable accessories, such as weapons and hand gestures, integrate seamlessly with the figure's design without disrupting its structural consistency or introducing visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The accessories in Image B, including the guns and hand gestures, are designed with attention to detail and scale, matching the figure's overall aesthetic. They are positioned naturally on the base, indicating they are intended to be part of the figure's set. There are no visible disruptions or artifacts where these accessories interact with the figure.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character stand naturally on the black base without visible distortion or unnatural support, ensuring the figure's visual stability and plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B stands firmly on the black base, with feet positioned in a way that supports the figure's weight realistically. There are no signs of distortion or additional supports that would detract from the figure's stability and plausibility as a standalone piece.",
