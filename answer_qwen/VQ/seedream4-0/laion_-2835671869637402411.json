      "question": "Does the transformed character have correctly proportioned limbs and head with no signs of unnatural stiffness or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted as a doll-like figure seated in a rocking chair. The proportions of her limbs and head appear consistent with typical stylized anime or doll aesthetics, where exaggerated features (such as large eyes and small nose) are common. Her arms are bent naturally at the elbows, and her legs are positioned symmetrically, showing no visible signs of unnatural stretching or compression. The joints (elbows, knees) align properly with the body’s posture. While the character's style is not realistic, the limbs and head maintain internal consistency in scale and articulation, without any evident distortions such as warped angles or disproportionate lengths. This suggests that the character’s anatomy, though stylized, is internally coherent and free from obvious stiffness or deformation.",

      "question": "Are the layers of the lace dress clearly defined with natural folds and shadows, and do they interact with light in a believable way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B features multiple layers, including ruffles and lace trimmings. These layers are visually distinct, with clear separation between them, especially around the skirt and bodice. Shadows are cast beneath each layer, suggesting depth and volume, and the lighting appears to originate from the right side (from the oil lamp), creating soft gradients across the fabric. The interaction of light with the lace patterns shows subtle highlights on raised edges, which enhances the texture and realism. There are no flat or uniformly lit areas, indicating attention to how light would realistically fall on layered fabrics. This level of detail suggests that the rendering respects principles of fabric physics and lighting behavior.",

      "question": "Does the wooden sewing kit have visible wood texture, appropriate internal components, and correct shadow alignment with the surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden sewing kit in Image B is rendered with visible grain patterns consistent with polished wood, indicating a realistic texture. Inside the open box, there is a spool of thread mounted on an axle, which is a standard component of traditional sewing kits. The thread is neatly wound, and the spool appears proportionate to the size of the box. Shadows cast by the kit extend toward the lower left, matching the direction of light from the oil lamp on the right. The shadow under the box blends smoothly into the rug, and its shape corresponds to the object's silhouette, suggesting accurate lighting and depth. There are no floating or misaligned shadows, confirming proper spatial integration.",

      "question": "Is the porcelain figurine rendered with a smooth, reflective surface and accurate three-dimensional shape that matches the scale of the original cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The porcelain figurine in Image B depicts a small female figure in a floral dress, standing upright. Its surface appears glossy and reflective, with soft highlights indicating a smooth ceramic material. The form is well-defined, with rounded contours and consistent proportions typical of handcrafted porcelain dolls. However, comparing it to the black cat in Image A (which was present beside the basket), we see that this figurine is significantly smaller than the cat—approximately half its height. Given that cats are typically larger than most decorative figurines, the scale seems plausible. But since the question asks if it 'matches the scale of the original cat,' and the cat in Image A was roughly the size of a real domestic cat, while the figurine here is much smaller, it does not match the same scale. Therefore, even though the figurine itself is rendered accurately, its relative scale differs from the original cat.",

      "question": "Does the oil lamp have a structurally sound design with visible glass and metal parts, and does it emit light that creates soft, realistic illumination and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The oil lamp in Image B has a classic design: a metal frame with a handle, a glass chimney enclosing a glowing flame, and a base with a fuel reservoir. All structural components are present and correctly assembled. The glass panel is transparent, allowing the flame to be seen, and the metal parts show reflections and subtle wear, adding realism. The light emitted from the lamp casts a warm, diffused glow on nearby surfaces, including the floor, rug, and side of the rocking chair. Shadows are soft and gradual, consistent with ambient light diffusion. The lamp’s illumination also affects the surrounding environment—e.g., the wall behind it is faintly lit—indicating a physically plausible light source. There are no harsh lines or unnatural brightness spikes, supporting a realistic lighting model.",

      "question": "Is the rocking chair fully grounded, properly scaled beneath the character, and free from geometric distortions such as bent legs or missing joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rocking chair in Image B is positioned on a patterned rug and appears to rest firmly on the floor, with both rockers touching the ground. The legs are straight and symmetrical, with no visible warping or bending. Joints at the armrests and backrest are clearly defined and structurally sound. The chair's scale is appropriate for the seated character—the seat height matches the character’s posture, and the backrest supports her upper body without appearing oversized or undersized. The curvature of the rockers is smooth and follows expected mechanical design for stability. No geometric anomalies such as broken lines or mismatched angles are observed, indicating a well-modeled and correctly placed object.",

      "question": "Are all edited elements (doll, dress, chair, sewing kit, figurine, lamp) free from jagged edges, color bleeding, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, all elements—including the doll, dress, chair, sewing kit, figurine, and lamp—display clean edges and smooth transitions between colors. There are no visible jagged lines (anti-aliasing is effective), no color bleeding along borders (especially noticeable around translucent materials like the glass of the lamp), and no pixelation or blocky textures. The rendering quality is high-resolution, with fine details preserved in lace patterns, wood grain, and fabric folds. Lighting effects are blended seamlessly, and shadows are soft without artifacts. This indicates professional post-processing and high-quality digital composition, ensuring visual integrity across all objects.",
