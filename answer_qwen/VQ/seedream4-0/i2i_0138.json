      "question": "Does the text 'Sharp' at the top left blend naturally into the image without causing any visible disruption to the scissors or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Sharp' is positioned in the top-left corner of the image, overlaying a portion of the scissor blade and the dark background. The font style is hand-drawn and white with a textured appearance, which contrasts sharply with the smooth metallic surface of the scissors and the matte black background. While the text does not obscure critical functional parts of the scissors (like the pivot or handles), it partially covers the upper edge of the left blade. This creates a visual interruption because the edge of the blade appears cut off by the lettering, especially around the 'S' and 'h'. Additionally, the texture of the text introduces a grainy effect that contrasts with the clean, reflective surface of the metal, making it stand out rather than blend in. From a design perspective, such text placement can be intentional for branding or emphasis, but visually, it disrupts the continuity of the blade’s form. Therefore, based on visual cues and aesthetic principles, the text does not blend naturally.",

      "question": "Is the text 'Clean' at the bottom right rendered in a sketch style that matches the image's aesthetic, without introducing any artifacts or visual noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Clean' is located in the bottom-right corner and is styled in a white, brush-stroke-like script with visible texture, similar to 'Sharp'. This sketch-style rendering complements the overall modern yet slightly artistic tone of the image. The font choice aligns with common design practices for product branding—using expressive typography to convey qualities like precision and craftsmanship. The text does not overlap any critical features of the scissors, such as the handles or pivot point, and is placed over the dark background where contrast is high but not distracting. There are no visible digital artifacts, pixelation, or noise in the text itself; the edges are smooth and consistent with the intended sketch effect. Given that the image has a polished, professional look, the addition of this stylized text enhances rather than detracts from the composition. Thus, the text matches the image’s aesthetic and maintains visual integrity.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the scissors preserved, with no apparent distortion in their shape caused by the placement of the texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scissors in the image appear to be symmetrically positioned and maintain consistent proportions throughout. The blades intersect at the pivot point, forming an X-shape typical of standard scissors, and the handles are evenly shaped and proportionate. The placement of the text 'Sharp' near the top left and 'Clean' near the bottom right does not alter the physical dimensions or curvature of the scissors. There is no warping, stretching, or compression of the scissors’ structure that would suggest digital manipulation affecting their shape. Even though 'Sharp' overlaps part of the blade, it does not distort the underlying geometry—the blade’s angle and length remain intact. Similarly, 'Clean' is placed away from the main body of the scissors, so it doesn’t interfere with their form. Based on visual inspection and knowledge of object consistency in photography and graphic design, the proportions of the scissors are preserved.",

      "question": "Do the fine details, like reflections and edges of the scissors, remain sharp and unaffected by the presence of the texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scissors exhibit clear reflections on their metallic surfaces, particularly along the blades and the golden handles, indicating high-quality lighting and a clean capture. These reflections are crisp and continuous across the entire visible surface. The text 'Sharp' is overlaid on the upper portion of the left blade, but it does not obscure or blur the underlying reflection—it remains visible beneath the letters, suggesting the text was added as a semi-transparent layer or carefully composited. However, the edges of the text itself are sharp and do not bleed into the scissors’ surface, preserving the clarity of the metal. Similarly, 'Clean' is placed over the background and does not interfere with any reflective areas of the scissors. No smudging, softening, or aliasing is evident in the scissors’ edges near the text. Therefore, the fine details of the scissors remain sharp and undistorted by the textual overlays.",

      "question": "Does the composition of the image, including the positioning of the scissors and the added texts, appear balanced and maintain visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition centers the scissors diagonally across the frame, creating a dynamic yet stable visual axis. The dark background provides strong contrast, drawing attention to the metallic sheen of the scissors. The text 'Sharp' is placed in the top-left, and 'Clean' in the bottom-right, forming a diagonal balance that mirrors the orientation of the scissors. This arrangement follows the rule of thirds and creates visual harmony by distributing elements across the frame without overcrowding. Both texts are stylistically consistent and enhance the message associated with the product—sharpness and cleanliness—without overwhelming the subject. There is no unnatural alignment or spacing that breaks realism. The overall image feels intentional and professionally composed, maintaining visual plausibility within a commercial or promotional context. Thus, the composition is balanced and coherent.",
