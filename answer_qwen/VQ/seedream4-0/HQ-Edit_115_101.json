      "question": "Does the cylindrical glass body maintain consistent curvature and transparency, with the embossed patterns clearly visible and proportionally scaled across the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cylindrical glass body of the bottle in Image B appears to maintain consistent curvature and transparency. The embossed patterns are clearly visible and proportionally scaled across the surface, as they follow the contours of the bottle without distortion. This is evident by observing how the light interacts with the glass and patterns, maintaining clarity and depth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the label \"Timeless Reserve\" centered within the circular area, with Roman numerals uniformly positioned along its perimeter and matching the font style and size of the original clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label 'Timeless Reserve' is centered within the circular area on the bottle's front face. The Roman numerals are uniformly positioned along the perimeter, matching the font style and size of what would be expected from a clock face design. This conclusion is drawn from the symmetry and alignment of the text and numerals relative to the circular boundary.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the top ring now resemble a functional bottle cap with a cork stopper that has a natural porous texture, and are the gold accents seamlessly integrated without visible seams or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top ring of the bottle resembles a functional bottle cap with a cork stopper that has a natural porous texture, which can be inferred from the detailed surface appearance of the cork. The gold accents around the neck are seamlessly integrated, with no visible seams or inconsistent lighting, suggesting a smooth transition between materials.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ornamental scrollwork patterns preserved with full depth and clarity across the curved glass surface, showing no signs of stretching, compression, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ornamental scrollwork patterns on the bottle are preserved with full depth and clarity across the curved glass surface. There are no signs of stretching, compression, or pixelation, indicating that the patterns have been carefully mapped onto the 3D model of the bottle to maintain their original intricacy and detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the reflections and shadows on the glass bottle align with the lighting direction of the scene, and are there no visible seams, ghosting, or texture discontinuities at the boundaries between the bottle and the wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflections and shadows on the glass bottle align well with the lighting direction of the scene, creating a realistic interaction between light and the object. There are no visible seams, ghosting, or texture discontinuities at the boundaries between the bottle and the wooden background, ensuring a cohesive visual presentation.",
