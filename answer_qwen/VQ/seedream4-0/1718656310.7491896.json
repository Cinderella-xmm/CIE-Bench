    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the stained glass wings feature consistent, smooth patterns without jagged edges or pixelated textures, and do they appear to transmit light naturally as if made of glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stained glass wings in Image B exhibit intricate patterns with smooth lines and no visible jagged edges or pixelation. The transparency and color gradients suggest light transmission, mimicking the properties of actual stained glass. This conclusion is drawn from observing the wing's design and how it interacts with the surrounding light.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dress composed of leaf-like and vine-like elements that maintain natural curvature, shading, and thickness, with no visible seams or synthetic textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B appears to be made of natural elements like leaves and vines, showing realistic curvature and shading. There are no seams or synthetic textures visible, which supports the idea that the dress is designed to look organic and integrated with nature. This analysis is based on the visual coherence of the dress's material with natural forms.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glowing mushrooms and twinkling fireflies integrated into the background with consistent lighting and depth, avoiding floating or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing mushrooms and fireflies in Image B are well-integrated into the background, with lighting and depth consistent with a forest setting. They do not appear to float unnaturally or seem misplaced, suggesting careful attention to detail in their placement and rendering. This assessment considers the harmony between these elements and the environment depicted.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do both hands show five fingers each with natural joint alignment, smooth skin texture, and no distortion or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both hands in Image B show five fingers each with natural joint alignment and smooth skin texture. There is no distortion or presence of extra digits, indicating a realistic portrayal of human anatomy. This conclusion is reached by examining the hands' structure and comparing it to typical human hand features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the legs positioned in a physically plausible seated posture with natural knee and ankle angles, and no elongation or compression of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The legs in Image B are positioned in a seated posture that looks physically plausible, with natural knee and ankle angles. There is no sign of limb elongation or compression, supporting a realistic depiction of the seated position. This evaluation is based on assessing the anatomical correctness and physical feasibility of the leg positioning.",
