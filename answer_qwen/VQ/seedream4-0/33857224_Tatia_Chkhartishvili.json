      "question": "Is the head proportionally enlarged but still geometrically consistent with the neck and shoulders, without unnatural stretching or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a stylized, cartoonish form typical of a rubber keychain. The head appears larger relative to the body, which is a common stylistic choice in such designs to emphasize facial features and create a cute or exaggerated aesthetic. However, despite this enlargement, the proportions between the head, neck, and shoulders remain consistent with the overall cartoon style. There is no visible distortion, such as unnatural stretching or compression of the neck or shoulders, that would suggest a flaw in the design. The transition from the head to the neck is smooth and maintains a coherent silhouette, which aligns with standard practices in character design for keychains. This suggests that while the head is proportionally larger, it remains geometrically consistent within the intended artistic style.",

      "question": "Are the surfaces of the body, dress, and hair uniformly rendered with a soft rubber texture, free from conflicting textures or glossy reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a rubber keychain, which is typically made from silicone or a similar flexible material. The visual cues—such as the matte finish, lack of sharp highlights, and uniform surface appearance—indicate a soft rubber texture across the entire figure. The body, dress, and hair all share this consistent matte quality, with no areas exhibiting glossy reflections or conflicting textures like metal, fabric, or plastic. The slight shadows and subtle depth suggest a three-dimensional form molded from a single material, reinforcing the impression of uniformity. There are no visual anomalies such as shiny spots or textural mismatches, which would be inconsistent with a standard rubber keychain design. Therefore, the rendering adheres to expectations for such an object.",

      "question": "Are the red boots and lace dress clearly identifiable with preserved structural details such as buckles, stitching, and knit patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red boots in Image B are clearly defined, featuring visible buckles on the side, which match the design of real-life rain boots. The shape and contours of the boots are accurate and recognizable. The white dress also retains its knitted texture and ruffled hemline, with detailed perforations and patterned stitching that mimic the original outfit's lace-like structure. These elements are simplified but still discernible, consistent with the level of detail expected in a rubber keychain. While not perfectly realistic, the keychain preserves enough structural detail to identify the boots and dress accurately. The presence of these features confirms that the essential design elements have been maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bent posture maintain anatomical alignment of the spine, hips, and knees without unnatural angles or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is shown in a forward-bending pose, with hands reaching toward the feet. The spine curves naturally in a rounded arch, and the hips are positioned correctly relative to the torso and legs. The knees are bent at a plausible angle, consistent with the motion of bending over. There are no floating limbs or disconnected joints, and the overall posture follows basic human biomechanics, albeit in a stylized form. While the proportions are exaggerated (e.g., large head), the alignment of the spine, hips, and knees remains anatomically reasonable within the context of cartoon representation. No segment appears misaligned or detached, which supports the conclusion that the posture is anatomically coherent.",

      "question": "Is the silver keyring visibly connected to the character without gaps or overlapping edges, and does the wooden plank background show consistent texture and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silver keyring in Image B is attached to the top of the character’s head via a small loop and chain. The connection point is clearly visible, with no gaps or overlaps that would suggest a poor attachment. The chain links are properly aligned and appear securely fastened. The wooden plank background beneath the keychain displays uniform horizontal lines with consistent spacing and texture, resembling real wood planks. There are no irregularities such as uneven gaps, distorted grain patterns, or mismatched colors, indicating a high-quality rendering of the background. Both the keyring connection and the background texture meet the standards expected for a product photograph of a keychain.",
