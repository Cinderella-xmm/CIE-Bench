      "question": "Are the beige and brown puzzle pieces uniformly aligned and interlocked across the surface of the sculpture without visible gaps, misalignments, or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the surface of the sculpture is covered with interlocking puzzle pieces that appear to be carefully fitted together. The beige and brown pieces are arranged in a grid-like pattern, with each piece having standard jigsaw contours. There are no visible gaps between the pieces, and the interlocking tabs and blanks seem to align properly. The edges are smooth and consistent, suggesting a uniform fit. While some slight variations in color tone exist (especially in the brown areas), these do not indicate misalignment. Based on visual cues and common knowledge of puzzle construction, where precision fitting is expected, the alignment appears accurate and intentional. No jagged edges or noticeable misalignments are evident.",

      "question": "Do the edges of the puzzle pieces follow the natural curvature of the original ceramic head shape without abrupt angular deviations or unnatural flattening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original ceramic head in Image A has a rounded, organic form, particularly around the cheeks, jawline, and top of the head. In Image B, the puzzle pieces are superimposed over this form. However, despite the curved nature of the sculpture, the puzzle pieces maintain their flat, angular geometry. This creates a contrast between the smooth, curvilinear surface of the ceramic and the rigid, rectilinear shapes of the puzzle pieces. While the pieces are placed along the contours, they do not conform perfectly to the curvature—especially noticeable along the side and back of the head, where the puzzle grid appears slightly flattened or forced into a non-natural shape. This suggests that the puzzle design prioritizes geometric regularity over anatomical fidelity, resulting in minor unnatural flattening and angular deviations. Therefore, the edges do not fully follow the natural curvature.",

      "question": "Is the green puzzle fragment on the top of the head smooth and free of rough textures, cracks, or color variations that contrast with the surrounding beige and brown puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green area on the top of the head in Image B appears to be a single puzzle piece that matches the shape and size of the others. It is visually distinct due to its color but maintains a similar texture and finish as the rest of the puzzle pieces. There are no visible cracks, rough textures, or irregularities on its surface. The green color is relatively uniform, though it shows slight tonal variation consistent with glaze effects seen in ceramics. Compared to the beige and brown pieces, the green one does not appear out of place in terms of material or finish—it seems integrated into the overall design. The lack of jaggedness or discoloration suggests careful crafting. Thus, the green fragment is smooth and consistent with the surrounding elements.",

      "question": "Is the sculpture placed horizontally on the white shelf with stable contact and no floating or tilting effects, maintaining a natural shadow and perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture rests on a white shelf. The base of the object makes full contact with the shelf surface, and there is no visible gap or floating effect. The shadow beneath the sculpture is soft and consistent with overhead lighting, indicating a stable placement. The perspective is straight-on, with no signs of tilting or rotation that would suggest instability. The alignment of the shelf edge and the sculpture’s base confirms horizontal positioning. Additionally, the lighting and shadows are natural and proportional, supporting the impression of a grounded, realistic setup. Based on visual cues and principles of photography and object placement, the sculpture appears securely and naturally positioned.",

      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, eyebrows, mouth, ears) clearly preserved in shape and proportion despite being integrated into the puzzle piece design, without deformation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features of the sculpture—such as the eyes, eyebrows, mouth, and ears—are located primarily on the front portion of the head, which is not covered by puzzle pieces in Image B. These features remain intact and unaltered by the puzzle overlay, preserving their original shape and proportions. The eyes are still circular with hollow centers, the eyebrows are dark and arched, the mouth is wide and toothy, and the ears are large and black. Since the puzzle pieces begin only after the face, they do not interfere with the facial details. There is no blurring or distortion of these features; they appear sharp and consistent with the original ceramic design. Therefore, the integration of the puzzle design does not affect the clarity or accuracy of the facial expression.",
