      "question": "Does the statue's body maintain anatomically accurate proportions and joint alignment, with no bent or elongated limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue in Image B appears to have a well-proportioned human form. The limbs are neither excessively elongated nor shortened, and the joints such as elbows and knees seem correctly aligned. This conclusion is drawn by observing the natural curvature of the arms and legs, which aligns with typical human anatomy. There are no visible distortions that would suggest otherwise.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
