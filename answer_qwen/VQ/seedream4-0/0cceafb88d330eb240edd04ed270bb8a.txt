    "Question": "Q1: Does the bust have a visibly coherent head-to-body proportion where the head is enlarged relative to the torso but remains structurally plausible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bust features a stylized figure with a large, rounded head in comparison to the torso. This is a common design choice in chibi or kawaii-style figurines, where the head is intentionally exaggerated for cuteness and visual appeal. Despite the enlarged head, the proportions are consistent with this artistic style—there is no structural distortion or anatomical impossibility. The neck connects smoothly to the torso, and the overall silhouette maintains balance. While not realistic, the design adheres to established conventions in collectible figurines, making it structurally plausible within its genre. Thus, the head-to-body ratio, though exaggerated, remains coherent and intentional.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the facial features simplified but still clearly defined, with no missing or distorted elements such as eyes or mouth?",
    "explanation": "The face in Image B displays simplified cartoonish features typical of stylized collectible figures. The eyes are large, round, and black, with no pupils or irises, which is common in this aesthetic. The eyebrows are simple curved lines, and the mouth is a small, gentle smile. All essential facial features are present: two eyes, one nose (implied by the shape), and a mouth. There are no missing or distorted elements. Although the features are abstracted, they are clearly defined and recognizable as human facial components. This simplification aligns with the design language of modern character toys, such as Funko Pops or similar collectibles.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the embroidered patterns on the robe appear continuous and logically structured, without jagged edges or disrupted textures?",
    "explanation": "The robe in Image B features intricate embroidered patterns along the front and sleeves. These patterns consist of geometric shapes and symmetrical motifs that are evenly spaced and aligned. The stitching appears smooth, with clean lines and consistent color transitions. There are no visible jagged edges, pixelation, or texture disruptions that would suggest digital artifacts or poor rendering. The embroidery follows a logical design structure typical of traditional textile art, suggesting careful attention to detail in the model’s creation. Given the high-quality finish and absence of visual flaws, the patterns are both continuous and well-structured.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the stripes on the headdress evenly spaced and smoothly colored, without visible artifacts such as color bleeding or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "The headdress in Image B has multiple horizontal stripes in vibrant colors including red, blue, yellow, green, and purple. Upon close inspection, the stripes are uniformly spaced and maintain consistent width throughout. The color transitions between stripes are sharp and clean, with no signs of color bleeding, smudging, or misalignment. The edges of each stripe are well-defined, indicating either high-resolution modeling or careful digital painting. The overall appearance is polished and free from rendering artifacts, suggesting professional-grade design work. Therefore, the stripes are both evenly spaced and smoothly colored.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the pomegranate have a glossy surface with natural-looking highlights that do not distort its shape or create false reflections?",
    "explanation": "The pomegranate held by the bust has a highly reflective, glossy surface with bright highlights concentrated at the top-right area, consistent with a light source positioned above and to the right. The highlights are smooth and follow the curvature of the fruit, enhancing its three-dimensional appearance without distorting its spherical shape. There are no unnatural reflections or specular glitches that would suggest over-rendering or incorrect material properties. The red color is vivid and uniform, and the crown-like calyx at the top is accurately detailed. Overall, the rendering of the pomegranate is realistic and visually coherent, with appropriate lighting effects.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the wooden base fully attached to the bust and visually grounded, with no floating or misaligned sections?",
    "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B is circular and appears to be made of polished wood with visible grain patterns. It is positioned directly beneath the bust, supporting it from below. The bottom of the bust rests flush against the top surface of the base, with no visible gaps or floating portions. The shadow under the base suggests physical contact with the surface it sits on, reinforcing the impression of stability and grounding. There are no misalignments or floating elements; the connection between the bust and the base is seamless and realistic. This indicates proper assembly and positioning in the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Does the hand holding the pomegranate have exactly five fingers with natural joint angles and no deformation?",
    "explanation": "The hand in Image B is stylized but clearly shows five distinct fingers: thumb, index, middle, ring, and little finger. Each finger is shaped with rounded tips and subtle joint articulation, consistent with the overall cartoonish design. The joints are not overly exaggerated or deformed, and the fingers wrap naturally around the pomegranate. While the hand is simplified compared to real anatomy, it maintains a plausible structure with no missing digits or unnatural bending. The spacing and curvature of the fingers are consistent with how a hand would hold an object, even in a stylized form. Thus, despite the artistic abstraction, the hand has five fingers with natural joint angles and no deformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
