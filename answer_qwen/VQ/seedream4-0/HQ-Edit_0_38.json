      "question": "Do the golden highlights on the grape clusters follow the natural curvature and lighting direction of the grapes without appearing as separate, overlaid patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden highlights on the grape clusters are carefully placed along the contours of the grapes. They appear to follow the natural shape and lighting direction, suggesting a light source from above that would naturally highlight these areas. The highlights blend smoothly with the purple color of the grapes, avoiding the appearance of being separate or overlaid patches. This integration is consistent with how light typically interacts with objects in nature.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the twisted vine design of the cane maintain smooth, continuous curves and proportional thickness consistent with a natural vine, without sharp breaks or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The twisted vine design of the cane in Image B exhibits smooth, continuous curves that mimic the organic growth patterns of a natural vine. The thickness of the cane varies subtly along its length, which is characteristic of a real vine's structure. There are no sharp breaks or irregularities visible; instead, the design flows naturally, enhancing the realistic appearance of the cane.",

      "question": "Are the ornate filigree details on the suitâ€™s fabric seamlessly integrated into the existing weave pattern without visible outlines or layering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ornate filigree details on the suit's fabric in Image B are intricately woven into the existing pattern of the fabric. These details do not have harsh outlines or layering artifacts that would disrupt the texture. Instead, they appear as part of the fabric's weave, contributing to a cohesive and elegant design that complements the overall look of the suit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the vineyard-themed symbols positioned in the corner(s) of the image at a scale and orientation that integrates naturally with the composition without appearing misplaced or oversized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vineyard-themed symbols in Image B are located in the corners of the image and are appropriately scaled relative to the rest of the composition. Their orientation aligns well with the edges of the image, creating a balanced frame around the central figure. The size of these symbols does not overpower the main subject, ensuring they enhance rather than detract from the overall visual harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the cane have exactly five fingers with natural positioning, skin texture, and shadowing consistent with the rest of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand holding the cane in Image B clearly shows five fingers with natural positioning. The skin texture appears consistent with the rest of the figure, featuring subtle wrinkles and shading that suggest a realistic human hand. The shadowing under the hand and around the fingers enhances the three-dimensional effect, making it look like a natural part of the figure.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all added or modified elements (golden highlights, filigree, symbols, cane design) rendered in colors that fall within the earthy tone range and do not introduce jarring or non-matching hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All added or modified elements in Image B, including the golden highlights, filigree, symbols, and cane design, are rendered in colors that harmonize with the earthy tones of the original image. The gold accents complement the natural colors of the grapes, leaves, and suit, maintaining a cohesive palette. There are no jarring or non-matching hues that disrupt the overall aesthetic.",
