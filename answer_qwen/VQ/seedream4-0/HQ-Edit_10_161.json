      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the dress preserved as continuous, non-distorted shapes without broken edges or misaligned tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress appears to be composed of mosaic-like tiles in various colors such as blue, yellow, orange, and red, arranged in a geometric pattern. These tiles resemble stained glass or ceramic pieces with defined edges and distinct boundaries. Upon close inspection, the shapes are largely continuous and maintain consistent alignment across the surface of the dress. There are no visible gaps, broken edges, or misalignments between adjacent tiles. The transitions between colors and shapes follow a structured, repeating pattern typical of intentional design. This suggests that the geometric forms are preserved with high fidelity, maintaining their integrity despite the artistic stylization. Given that the pattern is rendered in a highly detailed and coherent manner, it can be concluded that the shapes are not distorted or fragmented.",

      "question": "Do the necklaces appear as flat, transparent stained glass tiles with consistent color gradients and no jagged or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The necklaces in Image B consist of multiple layers of bead-like structures arranged in concentric circles around the neck. However, these beads do not resemble transparent stained glass tiles; instead, they appear more like solid, opaque strands of colored beads. The texture and lighting suggest a matte finish rather than transparency or refraction characteristic of glass. Additionally, the edges of each individual strand are smooth and well-defined, lacking any jagged or pixelated artifacts. While there is no evidence of digital distortion, the material does not exhibit the visual properties of stained glass—such as translucency, light diffusion, or internal reflections. Therefore, although the edges are clean, the description of 'transparent stained glass tiles' is inaccurate based on visual cues and material appearance.",

      "question": "Are the individual braids still distinguishable and proportionally accurate, with smooth transitions between segments and no collapsed or fused strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The braids in Image B are clearly visible and individually separated, extending from the scalp in a symmetrical fashion. Each braid contains embedded decorative elements (beads) at regular intervals, which help maintain their definition. The strands show consistent thickness and spacing, indicating proportional accuracy. There is no sign of fusion, collapse, or merging between adjacent braids. The transitions between the segmented parts of the braids—especially where beads are inserted—are smooth and natural-looking, suggesting careful rendering. The overall structure aligns with traditional African hair styling practices, where individuality of braids is preserved for cultural significance. Thus, both visual clarity and anatomical plausibility support the conclusion that the braids remain distinct and accurately represented.",

      "question": "Does the background display varied textures and elevation changes consistent with natural terrain, without uniform patches or unnatural color blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is not a natural landscape but rather an embroidered textile featuring stylized representations of terrain, including hills, rivers, and trees. The texture is highly uniform and repetitive, resembling hand-stitched fabric with raised threads forming patterns. While the design includes variations in color and shape to simulate elevation and landforms, these are artistic interpretations rather than realistic topographical features. There are no actual depth cues such as shadows, perspective, or natural erosion patterns that would indicate real terrain. Instead, the background consists of flat, patchwork-style areas with abrupt transitions and consistent stitching lines, which lack the organic variability found in nature. Therefore, the background does not represent natural terrain but rather a crafted, symbolic representation, making it inconsistent with real-world geological features.",

      "question": "Are the bracelets on both arms symmetrically positioned, correctly numbered, and free from distortion such as stretching or overlapping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bracelets on both arms are visible and appear to be stacked in multiple layers. On the left arm (viewer's right), the bracelets are aligned vertically and evenly spaced, showing no signs of stretching or overlapping. Similarly, the right arm (viewer's left) displays a matching set of bracelets with identical arrangement and spacing. Both sets contain the same number of bands—approximately five—and feature similar color schemes (white, red, green, blue). The symmetry is visually balanced, and the proportions are consistent with typical tribal adornment styles. There is no indication of digital distortion, such as warping or compression, and the positioning reflects cultural symmetry often seen in traditional body jewelry. Based on visual inspection and cultural context, the bracelets are accurately rendered and symmetrically placed.",
