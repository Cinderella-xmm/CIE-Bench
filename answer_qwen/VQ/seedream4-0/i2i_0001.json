      "question": "Does the keychain appear to be naturally integrated into the scene without any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain is held in a human hand against a neutral, softly lit background. The lighting on the keychain and the hand is consistent, with soft shadows that match natural light direction. There are no visible digital artifacts such as jagged edges, color bleeding, or pixelation around the keychain's outline. The surface of the keychain appears smooth and matte, consistent with rubber material, and its integration into the scene is seamless. The hand holding it provides scale and context, reinforcing the realism of the image. Given the absence of visual distortions or artificial elements, the keychain appears naturally integrated.",

      "question": "Are the keychain's features consistent with the chibi-style representation of the subject, preserving structural coherence and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain depicts the subject in a chibi (super-deformed) art style, characterized by an oversized head, large eyes, simplified facial features, and a small body. These stylistic choices are common in anime and kawaii merchandise. The blue headscarf, yellow dress, and pearl earring are retained, but stylized to fit the chibi aesthetic. The proportions—such as the large head relative to the body—are typical of this genre and do not compromise structural coherence. The design maintains a playful yet recognizable interpretation of the original subject. Therefore, despite the exaggeration, the keychain preserves visual credibility within the chibi framework.",

      "question": "Does the keychain maintain essential details that make the subject recognizable, avoiding distortions such as broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the stylization, the keychain retains key identifying features from the original artwork: the blue and yellow headscarf, the pearl earring, the yellow garment with a white collar, and the overall pose. These elements are simplified but not distorted—there are no broken lines, misshapen contours, or geometric inconsistencies. The face, though cartoonish, still suggests the same orientation and expression as the original. The symmetry and continuity of the shapes (e.g., the scarf’s drape, the collar’s curve) remain intact. This ensures that the subject remains clearly recognizable even in this stylized form.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the materials of the keychain, specifically the soft rubber texture and bold black outlines, accurately represented without introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain has a matte finish with subtle surface variations consistent with soft rubber or silicone materials commonly used in such accessories. The bold black outlines define the edges sharply, which is typical for molded rubber keychains to enhance visual clarity and durability. There are no signs of unnatural glossiness, uneven texture, or digital over-processing. The slight depth and shadowing around the edges suggest a three-dimensional form, further supporting the realistic representation of the material. The combination of matte surface and clean lines aligns with real-world expectations for such products.",

      "question": "Does the small silver keyring attached to the keychain appear proportionally correct and physically plausible, contributing to the overall visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silver keyring is small, circular, and connected via a short chain to the top of the keychain. Its size is appropriate relative to the keychain and the hand holding it—neither too large nor too small. The metallic sheen and reflective highlights suggest a realistic metal finish. The chain links are uniformly sized and properly connected, indicating physical plausibility. The attachment point is centered and secure, consistent with standard keychain construction. No anomalies in scale or material properties are observed, so the keyring enhances rather than detracts from the image’s realism.",
