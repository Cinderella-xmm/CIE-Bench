    "Question": "Q1: Does the robe's fabric show natural folds and creases consistent with silk material, and are the dragon and floral embroidery patterns continuous and free from jagged edges or missing stitches?",
    "explanation": "The robe in Image B is a richly embroidered traditional Chinese garment, likely a ceremonial or imperial-style robe given its intricate design. The fabric appears to be satin or silk, which typically drapes with smooth, flowing folds and subtle sheen. In this image, the folds on the sleeves and torso appear soft and natural, consistent with how heavy silk would hang under gravity. The light reflects off the surface in a way that suggests a glossy texture, reinforcing the silk-like quality. The dragon and floral embroidery are highly detailed, with gold threadwork forming continuous, fluid lines. There are no visible jagged edges or gaps in the stitching; the patterns are seamless and well-integrated into the fabric. This level of detail suggests careful rendering, possibly digital, but still adheres closely to real-world textile craftsmanship standards.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the jade accessories (such as necklace or earrings) display realistic translucency, soft highlights, and subtle internal refraction, and are they properly attached to the body without floating or clipping through skin or clothing?",
    "explanation": "The jade accessories in Image B include a long beaded necklace, matching earrings, and hair ornaments. These items exhibit a green hue typical of jade, with slight variations in tone suggesting depth and translucency. The beads have soft highlights that mimic how light interacts with semi-precious stones—there’s a gentle glow rather than harsh reflections, indicating realistic material properties. Internal refraction is subtly visible in the larger beads, where light seems to bend slightly within the stone. The necklace rests naturally against the collarbone and chest, following the curve of the body, and does not clip through the fabric or float unnaturally. The earrings dangle appropriately from the earlobes, maintaining correct proportions and attachment points. No signs of floating or misalignment are present, suggesting careful attention to physics and anatomy in the rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the extended hairstyle anatomically plausible with natural volume and flow, and do the jade hairpins sit securely within the hair without floating, intersecting, or causing unnatural bulges?",
    "explanation": "The hairstyle in Image B is an elaborate Qing-dynasty-inspired headdress, featuring a structured black base adorned with jade hairpins and decorative elements. The hair is styled in a high, voluminous bun with controlled layers, consistent with historical imperial court styles. The volume appears plausible for such a style, with gradual tapering and natural-looking strands framing the face. The jade hairpins are positioned symmetrically across the top of the head and are embedded into the hair structure in a way that suggests secure placement. They do not float above the hairline nor intersect through it in an unrealistic manner. There are no unnatural bulges or distortions around the pins; instead, the hair flows around them logically. While the overall style is stylized, it remains within the bounds of historical accuracy and physical plausibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the background feature clearly visible classical Chinese scrolls with consistent lighting, depth, and color harmony (rich reds, golds, deep greens), and does it blend seamlessly with the subject without abrupt edges or mismatched shadows?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B includes several hanging classical Chinese scrolls with calligraphy, displayed on wooden panels. These scrolls are rendered with sufficient detail to distinguish characters and ink strokes, contributing to a scholarly or imperial atmosphere. The lighting on the scrolls matches the ambient illumination on the subject—soft and directional from the front-left, casting gentle shadows that enhance depth. The colors are harmonious: deep greens of the walls contrast with warm reds and golds of the robe and scroll frames, creating a balanced palette typical of traditional Chinese aesthetics. There are no abrupt transitions between the subject and background; the edges of the figure blend smoothly into the scene, and shadows fall consistently, indicating a unified light source. The depth of field is shallow enough to keep the focus on the subject while still allowing background elements to be recognizable and contextually meaningful.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are both hands fully visible with exactly five fingers each, natural finger spacing and curvature, and no signs of fusion, extra digits, or unnatural bending?",
    "explanation": "Both hands in Image B are clearly visible, positioned gently in front of the body with fingers interlaced. Each hand displays five distinct fingers with proper spacing and natural curvature. The knuckles, joints, and nail shapes are proportionate and anatomically accurate. There is no evidence of fused fingers, extra digits, or distorted angles. The positioning of the hands—slightly curled inward—appears relaxed and natural, consistent with a poised posture. The lighting casts soft shadows beneath the fingers, enhancing their three-dimensional form without introducing any visual artifacts. Overall, the hands are rendered with high fidelity to human anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are the embroidery threads, jade surface textures, and scroll calligraphy sharp and clear, without visible pixelation, smudging, or artificial edge enhancement?",
    "explanation": "The details in Image B are exceptionally crisp. The embroidery threads on the robe show fine texture, with individual stitches visible along the dragon and floral motifs, indicating high-resolution rendering. The jade surfaces exhibit smooth gradients and micro-reflections, with no signs of pixelation or blurring. The calligraphy on the background scrolls is legible, with clean brushstrokes and consistent ink density, suggesting either a high-quality scan or precise digital recreation. There is no evidence of artificial edge enhancement (such as haloing or over-sharpening), and the textures appear organic and natural. The overall image quality is high, with consistent clarity across all elements, supporting the conclusion that these features are sharply rendered without technical flaws.",
    "answer": "Yes"
