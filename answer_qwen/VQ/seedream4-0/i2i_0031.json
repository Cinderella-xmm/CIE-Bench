      "question": "Are the simplified lifeguard tower and rescue vehicle icons free of unnatural textures and maintain their original key features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lifeguard tower and rescue vehicle are depicted as minimalist, stylized icons. The lifeguard tower is represented with a simple geometric structure: a rectangular observation deck with a red roof, supported by an X-shaped frame. The rescue vehicle is a yellow car with basic windows, wheels, and a red light on top. These elements are rendered using solid color blocks and clean lines without any texture, shading, or gradients. This flat design style is consistent with digital iconography, where textures are intentionally omitted to emphasize clarity and simplicity. The key features—such as the tower's elevated platform and the vehicle's shape and emergency light—are preserved in a recognizable form. Since the icons are not meant to be photorealistic but rather symbolic representations, the absence of texture is appropriate and does not constitute an unnatural quality. Therefore, they maintain their essential characteristics while avoiding any distracting textures.",

      "question": "Do the minimalist safety icons retain proper proportions and avoid broken geometric shapes when compared to surrounding elements in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lifeguard tower and rescue vehicle in Image B are composed of well-defined geometric shapes such as rectangles, squares, and circles. The tower’s support legs form a symmetrical X-shape, which is structurally balanced and proportionate to the height of the observation deck. The car has evenly sized wheels, a consistent body length, and windows that align with typical vehicle proportions. There are no fragmented or distorted shapes; all components are cleanly connected and properly scaled relative to each other. Although the image contains only these two elements (no surrounding objects for direct comparison), internally the proportions appear coherent and intentional. In the context of minimalist icon design, maintaining proportional harmony is crucial for visual legibility. The lack of distortion or asymmetry confirms that the geometric integrity is preserved. Thus, the icons do not suffer from broken or misaligned forms.",

      "question": "Are the minimalist icons integrated seamlessly into the scene without disrupting the overall visual plausibility and authenticity of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a standalone illustration of a stylized lifeguard tower mounted on a yellow rescue vehicle. While this combination is highly unusual in real-world contexts—lifeguard towers are typically stationary structures placed near beaches, not mobile units attached to vehicles—the image is clearly designed as a symbolic or conceptual representation rather than a realistic depiction. The integration of the tower atop the car is visually coherent within the minimalist art style, but it defies physical plausibility. Real-life rescue vehicles do not carry full-sized lifeguard towers, and such a configuration would be impractical. Therefore, although the visual elements are harmonious in style, the scenario lacks authenticity and realism. The seamless integration is achieved stylistically, but not in terms of functional or environmental plausibility. Hence, the overall visual authenticity is compromised.",

      "question": "Does the transition from detailed objects to minimalist icons result in a clean representation without degrading fine details or introducing visual noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists entirely of minimalist icons with no detailed objects present. It does not depict a transition from realistic to abstract elements, unlike what might occur in a hybrid image combining photography and illustration. Instead, it is uniformly rendered in a flat, graphic style with bold outlines and solid colors. There are no gradients, textures, or overlapping layers that could introduce visual noise. The edges are sharp, and the color blocks are distinct and uniform. Since there is no degradation of fine details (as no fine details were present to begin with), and no visual clutter or inconsistencies, the representation remains clean. However, the question implies a comparison between detailed and minimalist forms, which is not applicable here because the image is purely minimalist. Nevertheless, within its own framework, the representation is clean and free of noise.",

      "question": "Do the minimalist safety icons exhibit clean edges and distinct color blocks consistent with airport signage styles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Airport signage typically uses high-contrast, simple geometric shapes, bold outlines, and clear color coding (e.g., blue, red, white, yellow) to ensure quick recognition. The icons in Image B feature clean, sharp edges and solid color blocks—yellow for the vehicle, black for outlines, red for the roof and light, and blue for windows. These attributes align with the principles of minimalism and high visibility used in public safety signage. However, airport signs usually include standardized symbols (like arrows or pictograms) and are often monochromatic or limited in palette for consistency. While the design is clean and readable, the specific combination of a lifeguard tower on a car is not typical of airport signage, which focuses on directional cues, aircraft, terminals, or emergency exits. Thus, while the visual style shares some traits with airport signage (clarity, simplicity), the subject matter and composition deviate significantly from standard airport iconography. Therefore, the icons reflect a minimalist aesthetic but are not consistent with actual airport signage conventions.",
