      "question": "Do the crystal wands have smooth, continuous surfaces with consistent refraction and no visible digital artifacts or irregularities in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal wands in Image B are visually intricate, featuring faceted designs that resemble cut gemstones at their tips—colored red, blue, and clear—and twisted, geometric stems. The surfaces appear polished and reflective, with light refracting through the facets in a way consistent with real crystal materials. There are no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural distortions that would suggest digital artifacts. The shapes are symmetrical and proportionally consistent with high-quality crystal craftsmanship. Based on visual inspection and world knowledge of how light interacts with glass and crystal (e.g., dispersion, clarity), the refraction appears natural and continuous. The smoothness of the surfaces and the absence of rendering flaws support the conclusion that these wands are well-formed and realistic.",

      "question": "Are the etched floral patterns on the crystal vase evenly distributed, continuous, and visually integrated into the surface without breaking lines or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal vase in Image B features delicate floral etchings that are visible on its body and around the midsection where a carved ribbon-like band is present. These patterns are consistently spaced and follow the curvature of the vase. The etching appears to be uniformly deep and continuous, with no broken lines or abrupt transitions that would indicate poor craftsmanship or digital distortion. The shading within the etched areas is subtle but coherent, suggesting depth without artificial contrast or inconsistency. In real crystalware, such etchings are typically handcrafted or precision-cut, and the visual quality here aligns with that standard. There is no evidence of misalignment or incomplete rendering, indicating that the patterns are seamlessly integrated into the surface.",

      "question": "Is the carved crystal ribbon fully formed with intact floral motifs and no visible breaks, overlaps, or flattened areas that suggest a 2D-to-3D conversion error?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal ribbon encircling the vase is intricately designed with repeating floral motifs and appears three-dimensional. The carving has depth and follows the contour of the vase smoothly. There are no visible gaps, overlapping elements, or flat sections that would imply a failed 2D-to-3D conversion. The edges of the ribbon are sharp and well-defined, and the floral patterns are complete and symmetrical. Real crystal carvings often feature such detailed relief work, and this ribbon's appearance matches that expectation. The lighting highlights the texture and dimensionality without revealing any artifacts like flattening or warping. Thus, the ribbon appears fully formed and authentic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the reflection on the mirrored surface show a clear, undistorted image of the crystal vase and its contents, with proper symmetry and matching lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mirrored surface beneath the vase reflects the object clearly. The reflection shows the full form of the crystal vase, including the etched patterns, the crystal wands, and the pearls inside. The reflected image is symmetrical and aligned with the actual object above it, with no noticeable distortion or warping. The lighting in the reflection matches the ambient light in the scene—soft and diffuse—indicating consistent illumination across both the object and its reflection. There are no color shifts, blurring, or ghosting effects that would suggest digital manipulation or poor rendering. This level of fidelity in reflection is typical of high-quality photography or realistic rendering, where mirror reflections accurately preserve detail and spatial relationships.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pearls uniformly sized, evenly spaced, and free from warping or blurring that suggests compression or incorrect rendering due to the crystal vase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pearls inside the crystal vase are visible through the transparent material and appear spherical and consistent in size. They are densely packed but not compressed or deformed, and there is no indication of blurring or stretching that would suggest digital artifacting or improper rendering. The transparency of the crystal allows for a clear view of the pearls without distortion, and their arrangement seems natural. In real-world settings, pearls in such containers would settle with minor variations, but here they appear uniform and well-represented. There is no sign of compression artifacts, such as pixelation or edge halos, which might occur if the image were poorly rendered or heavily compressed. Therefore, the pearls appear realistically depicted.",
