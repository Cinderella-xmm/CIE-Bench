      "question": "Are the arms and face drawn on the pie’s surface consistent with the texture and color of the crust, without visible digital artifacts or mismatched shading?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly woman's face and arms appear to be superimposed onto the surface of the pie. The skin tones and facial features are clearly not part of the actual pie crust; they are rendered in a photorealistic style that contrasts sharply with the golden-brown, textured lattice crust. The lighting on the face and arms does not match the warm, diffused light reflecting off the baked pastry. Additionally, there are visible edges around the face and arms where the image has been digitally inserted—these areas show slight blurring or haloing, indicating digital artifacting. The shading on the face is inconsistent with the ambient light direction seen on the pie, which suggests directional overhead lighting. Furthermore, the texture of the 'skin' is smooth and lacks the crumbly, flaky appearance of the crust, making it visually jarring. This indicates a mismatch between the added elements and the original pie surface.",

      "question": "Does the lattice pattern retain its original grid structure and spacing, and does it appear as a draped fabric apron without broken or stretched lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lattice pattern of the pie in Image B has been creatively reinterpreted to resemble an apron worn by the elderly woman. However, this transformation distorts the original geometric regularity of the lattice. The horizontal and vertical strips of dough are now bent and curved to mimic folds in fabric, especially around the waist area of the apron. These distortions break the uniform spacing and symmetry of the original lattice design. In some areas, such as near the top edge of the apron, the lines appear stretched or compressed, suggesting digital manipulation. While the concept is imaginative, the structural integrity of the lattice is compromised for artistic effect. The transition from pie lattice to fabric-like apron involves stretching and warping that would not occur naturally in real-world baking or fabric draping, leading to visual inconsistencies.",

      "question": "Is the knife converted into a feather pen with a realistic quill tip and wooden shaft, and does it maintain a natural transition from the original knife shape without abrupt edges or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife from the original image has been replaced with a feather pen. The transformation includes a dark brown wooden shaft and a large, detailed quill at the tip. The quill appears anatomically accurate for a bird feather, with barbs and a central rachis. The shaft shows wood grain and a metallic ferrule connecting it to the feather, adding realism. However, the transition from the blade of the original knife to the base of the pen is abrupt and unnatural. There is no gradual morphing or blending of materials—instead, the metal blade ends abruptly and gives way to the wooden handle without any logical continuation. The texture of the wood does not flow seamlessly from the knife’s metal surface, creating a sharp boundary that stands out as a digital edit. Moreover, the overall size and angle of the pen do not align with the physical constraints of the pie’s surface, suggesting forced placement rather than organic integration.",

      "question": "Are the additional pastries positioned at a consistent distance and scale relative to the main pie, and do they cast realistic shadows and reflect the same lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes several small, anthropomorphized pastries surrounding the main pie. These pastries vary in size and are placed at different distances from the central pie. Their scale is inconsistent—some appear roughly the size of a slice of the pie, while others seem smaller or larger, lacking proportional coherence. The lighting in the scene suggests a primary light source from above and slightly to the left (based on the shadow under the plate and the highlights on the pie). However, the shadows cast by the small pastries are either absent or misaligned with this direction. Some pastries have no discernible shadow, while others have faint, diffuse shadows that don’t follow the expected geometry of the scene. Additionally, the pastries themselves have cartoonish features like eyes and limbs, which further disqualify them from being treated as realistic objects within the same spatial logic as the main pie. Thus, both their scale and lighting behavior fail to maintain consistency with the rest of the composition.",

      "question": "Are the text bubbles positioned close to the pie’s mouth, legible, and free from overlapping or clipping with the pie or plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple speech bubbles are present, each containing humorous phrases like 'Hush! Respect the quiet crust.' and 'You’ll get a slice of silence!' These bubbles are positioned near various parts of the pie and surrounding pastries. One bubble is near the upper-left corner, another near the bottom-left, and one near the top-right. However, none of these bubbles originate from the pie’s 'mouth'—in fact, the pie doesn't have a mouth, so the concept is metaphorical. The bubbles are placed somewhat arbitrarily and do not emerge from any specific character feature. They are legible and well-formatted, but they do overlap slightly with the edges of the plate and nearby pastries. For example, the bottom-left bubble ('Hush! Remeps') clips into the edge of a pastry and partially obscures it. Additionally, the top-right bubble intrudes into the space near the feather pen, creating visual clutter. While the text itself is readable, the positioning violates principles of clean layout and spatial awareness in graphic design.",

      "question": "Do the hands on the pie have exactly five fingers each, proper joint alignment, and a natural grip on the feather pen without deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands depicted on the pie in Image B belong to the illustrated elderly woman who appears to be emerging from the pie. Her right hand holds a feather pen. Upon close inspection, the hand appears to have five fingers, with distinct knuckles and fingernails, which aligns with human anatomy. The joints are reasonably aligned, and the grip on the pen is consistent with how a person might hold a writing instrument—thumb and index finger forming a pinch, with other fingers curled beneath. There are no visible extra digits or obvious deformations. However, due to the stylized nature of the illustration, some details like finger length and curvature may be slightly exaggerated for artistic effect. Still, within the bounds of digital illustration standards, the hand maintains anatomical plausibility and a natural-looking grip. The transition from the pie crust to the hand is seamless in terms of drawing style, though it is clearly a fictional addition.",
