      "question": "Are the paws of the husky significantly larger than natural proportions but still maintaining smooth, rounded shapes without distorted edges or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the husky is a plush toy, and its paws are visibly larger in proportion to its body compared to a real husky. This enlargement is typical of stuffed animals designed for visual appeal and huggability. However, the paws maintain smooth, rounded shapes with clearly defined toes and no jagged edges or geometric distortions. The texture appears consistent with soft fabric, and the overall form is cohesive and symmetrical. While the size is exaggerated relative to natural proportions, the shape remains anatomically plausible within the context of a plush toy. Therefore, based on visual analysis and common design principles for stuffed animals, the paws are indeed larger but retain smooth, well-formed geometry.",

      "question": "Is the entire body covered in a seamless, velvety fabric texture that uniformly replaces the original fur without visible seams, texture inconsistencies, or areas where fur remains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a plush toy version of a husky. The surface texture is clearly made of soft fabric, resembling velvet or plush material, which uniformly covers the body. However, upon close inspection, there are visible seams running vertically along the torso and around the limbs, indicating construction lines from stitching. These seams break the illusion of a completely seamless surface. Additionally, the texture varies slightly—some areas appear more compressed or padded than others—indicating texture inconsistencies. The fur from the original image (a real dog) has been entirely replaced, but the replacement is not seamless due to these structural seams. Thus, while the fabric is uniform in appearance, it is not truly seamless.",

      "question": "Are the eyes replaced with clearly defined, symmetrical embroidered patterns that maintain proper positioning and spacing relative to the nose and ears, without jagged lines or misplaced stitches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the plush husky are not realistic; they are stylized features. Upon close examination, the eyes appear to be made of a smooth, possibly plastic or glossy material rather than embroidery. There are no visible stitched patterns, threads, or needlework details that would suggest embroidery. Instead, the eyes are flat, round, and blue, with a uniform surface and sharp, clean edges. They are symmetrically placed and properly aligned with the nose and ears, which is consistent with standard plush toy design. However, since the eyes are not embroidered but likely printed or attached as plastic inserts, the description of 'embroidered patterns' does not apply. Therefore, the eyes are not embroidered, even though they are symmetrical and correctly positioned.",

      "question": "Does the tail appear significantly fuller and fluffier than in the original image but remain attached to the body with a continuous, cohesive shape and no floating or detached segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the plush husky is indeed fuller and fluffier than what would be seen in a real husky’s tail, especially when compared to the sleeker, more compact tail in Image A. The plush tail is made of dense, layered fabric, giving it a voluminous, bushy appearance typical of stuffed animals. It is securely attached to the back of the body, forming a continuous, cohesive shape with no gaps, floating parts, or detached segments. The connection point blends smoothly into the body, and the tail curves naturally without any visual breaks. This matches common plush toy design standards where tails are often exaggerated for aesthetic appeal while maintaining physical continuity.",

      "question": "Has the original snowy landscape and surrounding trees been fully replaced by a clean wooden shelf and minimalist backdrop, with no traces of snow, trees, or sky remaining in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a plain, light-colored wall with no signs of snow, trees, or sky. The husky is sitting on a wooden shelf, which is clearly visible beneath it. In contrast, Image A depicts a detailed winter scene with snow-covered ground, pine trees, birch trees, and a cloudy sky. All elements of the original outdoor environment have been removed in Image B, replaced entirely by an indoor setting featuring only the shelf and neutral backdrop. There are no remnants of snow, foliage, or atmospheric effects from the original scene. This indicates a complete environmental replacement consistent with product photography or staged display settings.",
