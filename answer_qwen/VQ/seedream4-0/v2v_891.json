      "question": "Are the chibi-style renditions of the monitor, computer tower, speaker, keyboard, and mouse free from any unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects inside the box—monitor, computer tower, speaker, keyboard, and mouse—are stylized in a chibi (cute, simplified) aesthetic. However, despite the exaggerated proportions typical of chibi design (such as large heads or oversized features), the core geometric forms of each object remain intact. The monitor has a rectangular screen with a proper stand; the computer tower maintains its vertical rectangular shape with visible front panel details; the speaker retains circular drivers; the keyboard shows a clear layout of keys; and the mouse is proportionally rounded but recognizable. There are no visible warps, jagged edges, or broken geometry that would suggest digital artifacts or rendering errors. These elements are consistent with intentional artistic scaling rather than distortion. Therefore, based on visual inspection and understanding of stylized design principles, the figures do not exhibit unnatural distortions.",

      "question": "Do the materials of the collectible figures, including the monitor screen, computer tower casing, speaker mesh, keyboard keys, and mouse surface, look natural and free from any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The materials depicted on the collectible figures appear to be stylized for aesthetic appeal rather than photorealism. The monitor screen is black and reflective, consistent with a glossy display surface. The computer tower casing has a matte black finish with subtle highlights indicating a smooth plastic-like texture. The speaker mesh is rendered with a fine grid pattern resembling real speaker grilles, though simplified. The keyboard keys show slight depth and uniform spacing, suggesting molded plastic. The mouse surface has a slight sheen and ergonomic curve, consistent with typical mouse designs. While these textures are simplified due to the collectible nature of the items, they do not exhibit pixelation, noise, or unnatural patterns. The lighting and shading are soft and consistent, avoiding any artificial or glitchy appearances. Thus, the materials look plausible within the context of a stylized collectible product.",

      "question": "Have the intricate details of the collectible figures, such as the buttons on the keyboard, the ports on the computer tower, and the speaker cones, been preserved without any loss of detail or introduction of artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the keyboard displays individual keys with legible labels and proper alignment, maintaining functional detail despite the small scale. The computer tower includes clearly defined drive bays and front-facing ports (USB, audio jacks), which are accurately represented in miniature form. The speaker cones are circular and centered within their housing, showing appropriate depth and concentric rings. These elements suggest that the designer prioritized fidelity to real-world components even at a reduced size. There are no visible blurring, ghosting, or aliasing effects that would indicate artifacting. Given the context of a collectible item designed to mimic real hardware, such level of detail is expected and present. Therefore, the intricate details have been preserved effectively.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the chibi-style figures inside the box, including the monitor, computer tower, speaker, keyboard, and mouse, create a balanced and visually credible layout that mirrors the original desk setup?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement inside the box follows a logical and symmetrical layout reminiscent of a standard desktop configuration. The monitor is centrally placed, flanked by the speaker on the left and the computer tower on the right. The keyboard sits directly in front of the monitor, and the mouse is positioned to the right, matching typical ergonomics. This spatial relationship closely mirrors the setup seen in Image A, where the same components are arranged on a wooden desk. The chibi versions maintain this relative positioning, ensuring visual coherence. Additionally, the inclusion of two cute figurines adds playful balance without disrupting the composition. The layout appears intentional and aesthetically pleasing, suggesting careful design consideration. Hence, the placement is both balanced and faithful to the original setup.",

      "question": "Does the soft cream hue of the box with delicate gold accents, along with the warm, pastel-toned minimalist design, complement the collectible figures and enhance the overall aesthetic appeal without appearing unnatural or out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box in Image B features a soft cream color palette with gold circuitry patterns and gear motifs, evoking a futuristic yet cozy 'tech lifestyle' theme. This choice of color scheme creates a warm, inviting atmosphere that contrasts gently with the black electronics inside. The pastel tones avoid harshness and instead contribute to a premium, collectible feel. The gold accents align with the 'luxury tech' aesthetic often seen in limited-edition gadgets or themed merchandise. The overall design is cohesive: the round window offers a glimpse into a warmly lit room, reinforcing the idea of a comfortable, modern living space. The integration of the collectible figures within this environment feels harmonious—neither clashing nor overly synthetic. The lighting is soft and diffused, enhancing the dreamlike quality without introducing visual anomalies. Thus, the design choices successfully elevate the aesthetic without appearing forced or unnatural.",
