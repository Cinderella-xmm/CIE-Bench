    "Question": "Q2: Are the enhanced facial expressions (focused eyes and light effects) integrated seamlessly into the athlete's face and do not appear as unnatural overlays?",
    "explanation": "The facial features in Image B, particularly the eyes, exhibit a high level of detail and integration with the rest of the face. The light effects around the eyes enhance the sense of focus and intensity but do not appear as separate overlays. They blend well with the skin tone and shading, contributing to a cohesive appearance. This analysis is based on the visual harmony between the facial elements and the absence of any jarring contrasts or separations.",
