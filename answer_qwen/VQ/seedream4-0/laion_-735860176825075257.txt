    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges of the rooflines, gables, and timber framing sharply defined and angular without rounded or blurred transitions that contradict the paper-cut style?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural elements such as rooflines, gables, and timber framing are rendered in a stylized, layered paper-cut aesthetic. The visual cues show crisp, clean lines with sharp angles and no softening or blurring at the edges. This is consistent with the characteristics of paper art, where each layer is precisely cut and positioned to create a dimensional effect. The absence of rounded or fuzzy transitions reinforces the intentional design choice to mimic handcrafted paper models. Given that paper-cut art relies on precise geometric shapes and clear boundaries, the sharpness observed here aligns perfectly with this artistic style. Therefore, based on the visual clarity and adherence to stylistic conventions, the edges are indeed sharply defined.",

    "Question": "Q2: Do the gold foil accents on the window frames and flower box edges appear uniformly applied with consistent reflectivity and no pixelated or smudged textures?",
    "explanation": "The gold foil accents in Image B are applied along the borders of windows and flower boxes, forming decorative elements within the paper-cut design. Upon close inspection, these accents exhibit a uniform metallic sheen with consistent reflectivity across all instances. There are no visible signs of pixelation, smudging, or irregular texture that would suggest digital artifacts or poor rendering. The foil appears as if it were carefully layered over the paper surface, maintaining a smooth and even finish. In high-quality paper art illustrations, especially those incorporating metallic elements, such consistency is expected to preserve the illusion of physical materials. Thus, the gold foil appears professionally rendered, matching the intended aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the crimson color of the entrance awning evenly distributed and consistent with the lighting direction, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural shadowing?",
    "explanation": "The crimson awning in Image B is depicted with a flat, solid red hue that spans across its surface. There is no variation in tone or gradient that would suggest directional lighting effects. However, since this is a stylized paper-cut representation, realistic shading is not expectedâ€”instead, the focus is on bold, flat colors. The lack of shadows or highlights means there are no abrupt color shifts or unnatural contrasts. While real-world lighting would introduce subtle gradients, the artistic style here intentionally avoids them. Therefore, within the context of the paper-cut medium, the crimson color is evenly distributed and appropriate for the style, even if it lacks photorealistic depth.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the geometric arch borders cleanly aligned with the edges of the image and do they not overlap or distort any part of the building's structure?",
    "explanation": "Each of the four panels in Image B is framed by an ornate geometric arch border made of thin golden lines. These borders are symmetrically placed around the central elements (house, window, door) and do not intrude into or obscure any architectural details. The alignment is precise, with the arches fitting neatly within their respective quadrants without overlapping the building structures or causing distortion. The design maintains spatial integrity, suggesting careful layout planning typical of professional graphic design. No warping or misalignment is visible, indicating that the borders serve as decorative frames rather than disruptive elements. Thus, the borders are properly aligned and respectful of the internal composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the edge of the image appear clean and continuous without visible clipping, jagged lines, or missing pixels that suggest improper trimming or rendering?",
    "explanation": "The overall boundary of Image B shows a smooth, uniform edge across all four panels. There are no visible signs of jagged lines, pixelation, or clipped corners that might indicate poor image processing or incorrect cropping. The background is a consistent neutral tone, and the transition between the panels and the surrounding space is seamless. The edges of the individual paper-like frames also appear clean and well-defined, suggesting high-resolution rendering and proper digital composition. In digital artwork, especially when presented in a grid format, such precision is essential for professional presentation. Since no artifacts are present, the image edge is considered clean and continuous.",
    "answer": "Yes"
