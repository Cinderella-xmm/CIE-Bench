      "question": "Does the cat’s curled-up posture in the chibi illustration match the original position on the car hood and maintain structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style cat is depicted lying curled up on the hood of a car, with its body positioned in a way that suggests it is resting on a flat surface. The orientation of the cat—head to the right, body curved inward, and paws tucked under—mirrors the general posture seen in the original photo (Image A), where the cat is also curled up on the car hood. However, in the chibi version, the proportions are exaggerated for cartoonish effect: the head is larger, limbs are simplified, and the overall shape is more rounded. Despite these stylizations, the core pose—the cat lying down with its back arched and face turned slightly downward—retains structural consistency with the original. The positioning relative to the car's hood is preserved, though the car itself is simplified and lacks realistic depth. Thus, while not perfectly accurate in anatomical detail, the posture maintains a recognizable and consistent form.",

      "question": "Are the gradient color blocks used to depict the cat’s fur smooth and free from unnatural textures or color blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi illustration uses simplified gradients to represent the cat's fur, employing broad strokes of brown and orange tones with darker stripes. These gradients are applied smoothly across the body, with no sharp, jagged edges or pixelation. While the fur texture is not realistic—it lacks individual hairs or fine details—the transitions between colors are generally even and follow the contours of the cat's body. There are no abrupt color shifts or unnatural blocky patterns that would suggest poor rendering. Instead, the design uses clean, vector-like shading typical of chibi art styles. Therefore, although stylized, the gradient application is smooth and visually coherent within the artistic context.",

      "question": "Does the car appear as a curved surface with reflection lines only, maintaining its structural integrity and avoiding obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is rendered in a simplified, cartoon style. It features a gray body with subtle highlights and shadow lines to suggest curvature and depth. Reflection lines are present along the hood and windshield, indicating light interaction with a curved surface. However, these reflections are minimal and stylized rather than photorealistic. The car’s structure is maintained with proper perspective: the windshield slopes upward, and the side mirror is positioned correctly. There are no visible artifacts such as misaligned edges, floating elements, or inconsistent shading that would compromise structural integrity. The use of smooth curves and consistent line work ensures the car remains recognizable and coherent despite being abstracted.",

      "question": "Is the sticker outlined with a thick white line and does it have a transparent background, retaining the visual coherence of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is presented as a sticker-style graphic, clearly defined by a thick white border around the entire composition. This border gives it a cut-out appearance typical of digital stickers. Additionally, the background consists of a checkerboard pattern, which universally indicates transparency in digital graphics. This means the sticker has a transparent background, allowing it to be placed over various surfaces without a solid backdrop. The combination of the white outline and transparent background enhances visual coherence by making the sticker stand out while remaining adaptable for different contexts. This is a common technique in digital illustrations to preserve clarity and usability.",

      "question": "Have any unnatural textures been introduced, or have key details of the cat and car been lost in the chibi illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The chibi illustration simplifies both the cat and the car significantly, but this is consistent with the artistic style. Unnatural textures are not present; instead, the artwork uses clean, smooth fills and bold outlines. While fine details like individual fur strands, whiskers, or complex reflections on the car are omitted, they are expected to be absent in a chibi design due to its emphasis on simplicity and charm. Key elements such as the cat’s curled posture, facial features (eyes, nose, ears), and the car’s basic shape (hood, windshield, side mirror) are preserved. The loss of detail is intentional and stylistic, not indicative of errors or degradation. Therefore, no unnatural textures were introduced, and essential features remain intact within the context of the art style.",
