      "question": "Is the rubber duck significantly larger than its original size but still proportionally coherent with the girl’s hand and the bathtub environment without appearing physically implausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rubber duck appears to be slightly larger than typical real-world proportions for a child's bath toy. However, it is still held comfortably in the girl’s hands, which suggests that the scale has been adjusted within a plausible range for a stylized cartoon depiction. The duck maintains a consistent shape and size relative to the girl’s body and the bathtub, indicating that while it may be exaggerated for visual appeal, it does not violate physical plausibility in this artistic context. In cartoons, objects are often scaled for emphasis or aesthetic reasons without breaking realism entirely. Therefore, the enlargement is stylistic rather than physically implausible.",

      "question": "Do the splash effects around the rubber duck and the girl's hand follow realistic water physics with smooth, continuous droplet formations and no pixelation or unnatural texture patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The splash effects in Image B are clearly stylized, featuring exaggerated, cartoonish water splashes with sharp, clean lines and dynamic arcs. These do not mimic real-world fluid dynamics, where water droplets would form more irregularly and with natural diffusion. Instead, the splashes appear as simplified, outlined shapes with minimal detail and uniform color gradients, characteristic of animated or illustrated media. While visually appealing, they lack the randomness and continuity seen in real water behavior. There is also no visible pixelation, but the texture is intentionally non-photorealistic. Thus, the splash effects are not realistic in terms of water physics, even though they are smoothly rendered.",

      "question": "Is the pink beret visibly larger than the original but still properly aligned with the girl’s head, maintaining natural fabric folds and shadowing without distorting her face or hairline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pink beret in Image B appears slightly larger and more rounded compared to typical real-life berets, likely due to the cartoon style. However, it remains centered on the girl’s head, with soft shading and fold lines that suggest fabric draping naturally. The edges of the beret align well with the contours of her head and hairline, and there is no distortion of facial features or hair. The rendering preserves the sense of depth and volume, using gradient shading to simulate three-dimensionality. Although the beret is stylized, its proportions and placement remain consistent with the character’s anatomy, avoiding any unnatural stretching or misalignment.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the materials and textures of the bathtub, tiles, and faucet consistently stylized in a cartoon-like manner without visible breaks in geometry or loss of fine detail such as grout lines or metallic reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all elements — the bathtub, tiles, and faucet — are rendered in a consistent cartoon art style. The tiles have clean, straight edges with subtle shading to suggest depth, and the grout lines are present but simplified. The faucet has a metallic appearance with soft highlights that imply reflectivity, though not in a photorealistic way. The overall geometry remains intact, with no broken edges or missing details. While the textures are stylized (e.g., flat colors, minimal surface variation), they maintain coherence within the artistic framework. There is no visible inconsistency or loss of fine detail; instead, the design emphasizes clarity and aesthetic harmony over realism. This consistency supports the cartoon aesthetic throughout.",

      "question": "Are the bubbly borders and any added frame elements visually consistent with the scene’s depth and lighting, without overlapping or obscuring key elements like the ship model or faucet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bubbly border surrounding the image in Image B is a decorative frame element that floats above the main scene. It consists of translucent bubbles with rainbow-like refractions, adding a whimsical effect. These bubbles are placed along the outer edge of the image and do not intrude into the central composition. Importantly, they do not overlap or obscure critical background elements such as the wooden ship model on the shelf or the faucet behind the girl. The lighting within the bubbles matches the ambient light of the scene, suggesting they are part of the same visual layer. Their transparency allows underlying elements to remain visible, preserving the integrity of the scene. Thus, the frame enhances rather than disrupts the visual narrative.",
