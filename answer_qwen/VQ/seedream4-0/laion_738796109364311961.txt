    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the player in red (player #24) exhibits exaggerated muscle proportions. The muscles are significantly larger and more defined than typical human anatomy, suggesting a stylized or cartoonish approach. However, these proportions still follow basic anatomical guidelines without appearing unnaturally distorted or bulging. The visual cues such as muscle definition and placement align with common artistic exaggerations seen in sports illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The uniform colors of both players in Image B appear vibrant but retain natural color gradients and material textures. The red and white uniforms show shading and highlights that suggest fabric texture, and the colors do not seem oversaturated or flat. This is consistent with how sports uniforms are often depicted in stylized art forms to maintain realism while enhancing visual appeal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The team logos on both players' helmets and jerseys in Image B are accurately rendered and properly aligned. There is no visible deformation or pixelation; the logos are clear and sharp, which is typical for high-quality digital art. The logos maintain their integrity despite the stylistic enhancements applied to the overall image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The background behind the players in Image B is stylistically enhanced with bright, colorful spectators and field markings.

The crowd and field details are consistent and there are no sudden distortions or loss of detail, indicating a well-integrated background that complements the main subjects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The limbs and body postures of both players in Image B maintain structural consistency with real-world biomechanics. Even though the motion is exaggerated, the joints and limbs are connected logically, without any broken joints or floating limbs. The postures are dynamic yet plausible within the context of a stylized sports illustration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
