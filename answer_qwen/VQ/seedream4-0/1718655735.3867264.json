      "question": "Does the glass dome surrounding the fairy have consistent transparency, smooth surface curvature, and realistic reflections without visible artifacts such as jagged edges or unnatural refractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B exhibits a high degree of visual fidelity. Its surface is smooth with no visible jagged edges or pixelation, indicating a well-rendered curvature. The transparency is consistent throughout, allowing clear visibility of the fairy and internal elements like floating petals. Realistic reflections are present on the dome’s surface, including subtle highlights and light distortions that mimic how light interacts with curved glass. There are no obvious artifacts such as unnatural refractions or warping of the fairy's image through the glass, which suggests accurate simulation of optical properties. The dome's shape is symmetrical and physically plausible, further supporting its realism. These observations align with real-world physics of light behavior on glass surfaces, confirming the dome's quality.",

      "question": "Is the wooden base beneath the fairy rendered with realistic wood grain patterns, consistent shading, and no artificial or distorted surface features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B displays detailed wood grain patterns that follow natural directional flow typical of polished hardwood. The shading is consistent with ambient lighting, showing subtle gradients from light to dark that suggest depth and three-dimensionality. There are no visible distortions, such as unnatural warping or repeating textures, which might indicate low-resolution texturing or digital artifacts. The surface appears smooth and reflective in areas where light hits it, consistent with a polished finish. This level of detail matches expectations for high-quality 3D rendering of wood materials, especially in collectible display cases. Therefore, the base is rendered realistically without artificial or distorted features.",

      "question": "Are the butterfly wings' metallic surfaces evenly lit with subtle highlights and reflections, maintaining intact venation patterns and no visible texture repetition or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly wings in Image B are rendered with a metallic sheen that reflects light smoothly across their surface. Highlights are soft and distributed naturally, suggesting even illumination. The venation patterns—fine lines resembling those found in real butterfly wings—are clearly visible and maintain continuity without abrupt breaks or repetitions. There is no evidence of tiling artifacts or stretched textures, which could occur in lower-quality renders. The metallic finish shows slight variations in tone and reflectivity, mimicking real-world material behavior under diffuse lighting. The overall appearance is cohesive and physically plausible, consistent with high-fidelity digital artistry.",

      "question": "Do the fabric textures on the fairy’s outfit appear detailed and continuous, with no abrupt transitions, blurring, or inconsistencies in thread patterns or material thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fairy’s outfit in Image B features intricate lace and layered fabric textures that appear highly detailed. The patterns on the bodice and skirt show fine craftsmanship with consistent threadwork and no visible seams or abrupt transitions between texture regions. Material thickness varies appropriately—thicker at folds and thinner at translucent sections—indicating careful modeling of fabric behavior. There is no blurring or loss of detail, even in shadowed areas, suggesting high-resolution texturing. The continuity of the design across different parts of the garment supports a seamless integration of materials, which is characteristic of advanced digital rendering techniques. Thus, the fabric textures are rendered convincingly.",

      "question": "Are the floating petals and leaves positioned at varying depths with soft edges and translucent qualities, showing no overlapping errors, sharpness mismatches, or unnatural placement relative to the fairy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floating petals and leaves in Image B are rendered with soft, translucent edges and subtle translucency, giving them an ethereal quality. They are distributed at various apparent depths, creating a sense of three-dimensional space within the dome. There are no overlapping errors—each petal or leaf appears to occupy its own spatial layer without clipping into others. Sharpness is consistent across all elements, matching the focus of the scene, and there is no indication of mismatched depth-of-field effects. Their positions around the fairy feel natural and balanced, contributing to a dreamlike atmosphere without appearing forced or misplaced. This careful composition aligns with principles of visual harmony and depth perception in digital art.",

      "question": "Is the blue gradient background smoothly transitioned without visible color bands, pixelation, or irregularities in tone distribution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a smooth blue gradient that transitions from a lighter shade at the bottom to a deeper blue at the top. There are no visible color bands (also known as banding artifacts), which typically appear as distinct steps in color change when gradients are poorly rendered. The tone distribution is uniform, with no pixelation or noise, suggesting high-resolution rendering. The gradient enhances the sense of depth and complements the enclosed scene without distracting from the central subject. This kind of smooth transition is common in professional-grade digital compositions and indicates careful post-processing or high-quality rendering settings.",
