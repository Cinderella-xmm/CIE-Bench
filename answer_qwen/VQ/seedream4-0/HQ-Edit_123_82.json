      "question": "Are the butterfly wings proportionally sized relative to the woman’s body and positioned naturally behind her shoulders without overlapping or distorting her silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings are visually large and extend symmetrically from behind the woman's shoulders. Their size appears exaggerated compared to a typical human figure, as real butterfly wings would not be this large relative to a person's body. However, in the context of fantasy or artistic illustration, such proportions are common. The wings are positioned directly behind her shoulders and do not overlap with her arms or torso in a way that distorts her silhouette. They are placed in a manner consistent with how wings might be attached to a humanoid figure in stylized art. While not anatomically accurate, they maintain a natural-looking attachment point and spatial relationship with the body. Therefore, despite their fantastical scale, they are proportionally balanced within the artistic style and do not distort the figure.",

      "question": "Do the butterfly wings display consistent and detailed textures across their surfaces, with no visible artifacts such as jagged edges, repeated patterns, or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly wings in Image B feature intricate patterns resembling those of a morpho butterfly, with blue, orange, and black coloration. The texture includes fine lines mimicking wing veins and subtle gradients that suggest depth. Upon close inspection, the pattern appears mostly consistent, with no obvious jagged edges or pixelation. There is a slight repetition in the scale-like texture, particularly in the blue sections, which could suggest digital rendering artifacts. However, these are minor and likely intentional for stylistic effect. The shading follows the curvature of the wings logically, giving them a three-dimensional appearance. Overall, while there are minor signs of digital generation (like uniformity in some textures), the wings are largely free of major artifacts and maintain visual coherence.",

      "question": "Does the woman’s body maintain natural proportions, with no exaggerated limbs, distorted joints, or disproportionate head size that would compromise visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's body is depicted in an anime-style illustration, which often features stylized proportions. Her limbs are slender but not excessively elongated; her arms and legs appear proportionate to her torso. The head size is slightly larger than average, which is typical in anime aesthetics to emphasize facial expressions. Her neck is appropriately scaled, and her joints (elbows, shoulders) are well-defined without distortion. While the proportions are idealized, they remain within the bounds of visual credibility for this art style. There are no visible deformities or unnatural bends in limbs. Thus, despite being stylized, the figure maintains coherent anatomical structure suitable for its genre.",

      "question": "Is the gold embroidery on the red dress clearly defined, textured appropriately, and integrated into the fabric without appearing flat, misplaced, or disconnected from the material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red dress in Image B features ornate gold embroidery along the front panel and straps. The embroidery has a raised, thread-like appearance with clear outlines and shading that suggests depth and texture. It follows the contours of the dress naturally, aligning with the folds and seams. The design appears to be part of the fabric rather than pasted on, as it interacts with light and shadow consistently. There are no floating elements or misalignments with the garment's structure. The pattern is symmetrical and flows organically down the dress, indicating careful integration. In terms of realism within the illustrative style, the embroidery is convincingly rendered and does not appear flat or disconnected.",

      "question": "Are the months displayed on the wings clearly legible, properly aligned, and integrated into the wing design without disrupting the wing’s shape or causing visual conflicts such as overlapping or floating text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the butterfly wings in Image B, several calendar pages are affixed, each labeled with months such as 'June', 'November', '2023', etc. These labels are written in a script font and appear to be superimposed onto the wing surface. However, the placement of these text elements is inconsistent—some are rotated or skewed, and others partially obscure the wing’s natural patterns. The words 'Savanna' and 'Doeqin' (likely names) are embedded into the wings, but they are not aligned with any logical grid or flow. The calendar cards themselves are arranged haphazardly, with some overlapping each other and the wing edges. This creates a sense of visual clutter and disrupts the organic form of the wings. Moreover, the text appears to float above the wing surface rather than being integrated into it, suggesting poor design integration. Therefore, the text is not clearly legible in context and interferes with the aesthetic and structural integrity of the wings.",
