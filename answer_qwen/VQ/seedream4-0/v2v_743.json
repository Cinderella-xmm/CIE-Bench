        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figurine is depicted inside a Polaroid-style photograph that is being held by a human hand. The figurine appears fully contained within the boundaries of the photo’s frame, with no parts extending beyond it. There are no visual indications of the figurine emerging from the frame—such as partial overlaps, transparency, or distortions at the edges. The image maintains a clean separation between the 2D photograph and the 3D-like figurine, which is rendered entirely within the photo's border. This suggests that the figurine does not emerge from the frame but remains confined to it. Based on common visual expectations of how photographs work, objects do not typically 'emerge' from them unless explicitly stylized for surreal effects (e.g., pop-up art), which is not present here. Therefore, there are no visible breaks or unnatural edges suggesting emergence.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the chibi figurine consistent with its interaction with the Polaroid frame and the human hand, avoiding any distortion or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figurine in Image B is stylized with exaggerated features typical of chibi art—large head, small body, and simplified limbs. However, when considering its scale relative to the Polaroid frame and the human hand holding it, the proportions appear plausible. The size of the figurine within the photo matches the expected scale of a character drawn in a standard photo format. The hand holding the Polaroid is proportionally sized compared to the frame, and the figurine fits naturally within the photo’s dimensions. There is no evidence of stretching, compression, or disproportionate scaling that would make the figurine appear too large or too small for the context. While the chibi style inherently alters real-world proportions, the internal consistency between the figurine, the frame, and the hand suggests realistic scaling within the artistic convention. Thus, despite stylization, the proportions are consistent and avoid unrealistic distortion.",

      "question": "Does the chibi figurine retain clear and natural textures, especially in areas like clothing and hair, without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figurine in Image B exhibits smooth, clean surfaces typical of 3D-rendered cartoon characters. The yellow shirt and shorts have uniform coloration with subtle shading that suggests fabric texture, though it is stylized rather than photorealistic. The hair is rendered with defined strands and volume, maintaining a consistent appearance without pixelation or blurring. The shoes show clear separation between materials (e.g., white soles, black uppers, yellow accents), indicating attention to detail. While the textures are not hyper-realistic, they are coherent and well-defined for a chibi design. There is no visible loss of detail or artifacting in key areas such as clothing seams or hair edges. Given that chibi art prioritizes simplicity and clarity over realism, the textures remain natural within this stylistic framework.",

      "question": "Is the yellow attire of the chibi figurine consistent in color and material with the original image, contributing to a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the tennis player wears a bright yellow t-shirt, headband, and wristband, all matching in tone and material (likely athletic fabric). In Image B, the chibi figurine also wears yellow clothing—a shirt, shorts, headband, and wristband—that closely matches the hue and saturation of the original. The material appearance, while stylized, retains the same yellow shade and is consistent with the aesthetic of athletic wear. Although the texture is simplified due to the chibi style, the color continuity ensures visual coherence between the two images. This consistency helps maintain a natural transition from the real-life athlete to the cartoon version, reinforcing the idea that the figurine is a stylized representation of the original. Thus, the yellow attire is both color- and material-consistent with the original image, supporting a cohesive and natural appearance.",

      "question": "Does the Polaroid photograph and the human hand holding it appear natural and structurally consistent, with no unnatural artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Polaroid photograph in Image B has a clean white border and a rectangular shape typical of instant photos. The image within the frame is sharp and properly aligned, with no warping or perspective distortion. The human hand holding the photo appears anatomically correct, with natural finger positioning and skin texture. There are no visible artifacts such as jagged edges, shadows that don’t align with lighting, or unnatural transparency. The lighting on the hand and the photo is consistent, suggesting a single light source from above, which enhances realism. The way the fingers grip the edge of the Polaroid is believable and proportional. Overall, both the Polaroid and the hand are rendered with high fidelity and structural accuracy, lacking any obvious digital anomalies or distortions. This contributes to a convincing and natural presentation.",
