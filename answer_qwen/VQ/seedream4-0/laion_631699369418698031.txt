    "Question": "Q1: Is the cylindrical glass dome fully enclosing the totem pole without visible clipping, jagged edges, or unnatural transparency?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cylindrical glass dome appears to be a seamless, transparent enclosure surrounding the totem pole. The edges of the dome are smooth and continuous, with no visible clipping or jagged lines that would suggest digital artifacts or poor rendering. The transparency of the glass is consistent and realistic—light reflects naturally off its surface, and the background forest is softly blurred behind it, indicating depth and proper refraction. There are no signs of pixelation or unnatural transparency gradients that would imply editing flaws. Based on visual cues such as reflection, refraction, and edge continuity, combined with common knowledge about how glass domes behave in photography and digital compositing, the dome appears professionally rendered and fully enclosing the object.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the ferns and moss at the base of the totem grounded and proportionally sized, with no floating or misaligned elements?",
    "explanation": "The ferns and moss at the base of the totem in Image B appear to be rooted in a naturalistic arrangement on the wooden base beneath the glass dome. They are positioned around the bottom of the totem, resting on what looks like a layer of soil or substrate, suggesting grounding. The size and shape of the ferns are consistent with real fern species found in forest environments, and they do not appear disproportionately large or small relative to the totem. There are no floating elements—the fronds curve naturally, and their shadows align with the lighting direction from above. The moss is spread evenly and realistically across the base, showing texture and depth. This alignment with botanical realism and physical grounding suggests careful composition and attention to scale and placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the butterfly perched on the top of the totem with correct scale, natural wing shape, and no deformation of the totem’s structure?",
    "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B is positioned on the uppermost part of the totem, near the head with horn-like protrusions. Its wings display a natural orange and black pattern typical of a monarch butterfly, with proper symmetry and vein structures. The scale of the butterfly appears appropriate for its position—it is not oversized or undersized relative to the totem's features. Importantly, the totem’s structure beneath the butterfly shows no signs of deformation; the wood grain and carved details remain intact and undistorted. The butterfly's legs are delicately placed on the edge of the carving, which adds to the sense of realism. Given that butterflies typically rest on surfaces without altering them, and the totem remains structurally sound, this indicates a well-executed integration of the butterfly into the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the ferns, moss, and butterfly use natural green tones that harmonize with the wood color of the totem without unnatural color shifts?",
    "explanation": "The colors of the ferns and moss in Image B are rich and varied greens, ranging from bright lime to deep forest green, which are typical of healthy plant life in shaded woodland environments. These tones complement the warm brown hues of the wooden totem, creating a natural contrast that enhances the overall aesthetic. The butterfly has vibrant orange and black wings, which are characteristic of monarch butterflies and stand out appropriately against the earthy background without appearing oversaturated or artificially enhanced. There are no visible color shifts, such as unnatural glows or chromatic aberrations, that would suggest digital manipulation. The lighting across all elements is consistent, reinforcing the harmony between the organic materials and the wooden sculpture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are all carved facial features and wood grain details on the totem clearly visible and undistorted after editing?",
    "explanation": "The totem pole in Image B retains sharp definition in its carved facial features—eyes, noses, mouths, and decorative patterns—across all three stacked faces. The wood grain is visibly detailed, with texture running vertically along the surface, consistent with real wood carving. There are no signs of blurring, stretching, or distortion that might result from poor image editing or scaling. Even under the glass dome, where reflections could potentially obscure details, the carvings remain clear and legible. Comparing this to the original (Image A), the same level of detail is preserved, indicating that the editing process did not compromise resolution or clarity. The lighting in Image B enhances the depth of the carvings without overexposing or flattening them, further supporting the conclusion that the details are faithfully represented.",
    "answer": "Yes"
