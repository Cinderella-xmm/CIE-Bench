      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the table and chairs composed of uniformly sized brown and amber LEGO bricks with clean, interlocking edges and no visible breaks or misalignments in their surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table and chairs appear to be constructed from LEGO bricks, identifiable by their characteristic stud patterns and blocky geometry. The color palette includes various shades of brown and amber, consistent with LEGO’s color range for wooden-like furniture. Upon close inspection, the bricks seem to be uniformly sized and aligned, with clean interlocking edges typical of LEGO construction. There are no visible breaks, gaps, or misalignments in the brickwork, suggesting a high-quality digital rendering or physical build that maintains structural integrity. The design mimics real-world furniture but uses LEGO aesthetics faithfully, which supports the conclusion that the components are well-assembled without defects.",

      "question": "Do the tabletop and chair seats display a consistent LEGO brick texture with repeating stud patterns and no unnatural stretching or distortion of individual bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tabletop and chair seats in Image B exhibit a highly detailed LEGO brick texture, characterized by the uniform, raised circular studs across the surface. This pattern is consistent throughout all horizontal surfaces, such as the tabletop and seat planks, indicating careful attention to detail in the design. There is no visible stretching or warping of the brick elements; each stud appears evenly spaced and proportionally correct relative to the size of the bricks. This consistency suggests either a precise digital model or a meticulously assembled physical set, adhering closely to LEGO’s standard brick dimensions and textures. The absence of distortions supports the conclusion that the texture is accurate and natural within the LEGO aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the central element on the table a LEGO-style plant made of green bricks with recognizable leaf shapes, and is it positioned centrally without overlapping or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central object on the table in Image B is clearly designed to resemble a plant constructed from LEGO bricks. It features green pieces arranged in a way that mimics foliage, with distinct leaf-like shapes formed by stacked and angled bricks. The structure sits atop a brown baseplate that matches the table’s color scheme, ensuring visual coherence. The plant is positioned precisely at the center of the table and rests flush with the surface, showing no signs of floating or overlapping beyond its intended footprint. Its placement and construction align with LEGO design principles, where modular elements are integrated seamlessly into larger builds. This confirms both the authenticity of the LEGO style and proper spatial integration.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the furniture placed on a flat, gray LEGO baseplate that fits snugly beneath the table and chairs, with no overhang beyond the furniture edges and no visible seam between the baseplate and the real ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire furniture set rests on a large, flat gray LEGO baseplate, which is identifiable by its signature stud pattern and uniform gray color. The baseplate extends slightly beyond the edges of the table and chairs, providing a stable foundation. However, there is a noticeable overhang on the sides, particularly around the bench and chairs, where the baseplate protrudes beyond the furniture's footprint. Additionally, a clear seam is visible between the edge of the baseplate and the surrounding concrete patio, indicating a separation between the artificial LEGO layer and the real-world environment. While the baseplate is flat and properly textured, the presence of overhang and visible seams contradicts the requirement of a snug fit without gaps or extensions. Therefore, the baseplate does not fully meet the criteria described in the question.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged edges, pixelation, or unnatural lighting shadows around the LEGO furniture that suggest incomplete rendering or poor integration with the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the LEGO furniture exhibits smooth edges and clean lines, with no visible jaggedness or pixelation, suggesting a high-resolution render or photograph of a well-constructed model. The lighting appears consistent with the outdoor setting, casting soft shadows that align naturally with the direction of sunlight. However, there are subtle discrepancies in shadow behavior—specifically, the shadows under the furniture do not perfectly match the expected depth or angle based on the light source, and the transition between the LEGO baseplate and the real ground shows slight inconsistencies in shading. These minor anomalies suggest that while the overall integration is strong, there are faint signs of digital manipulation or rendering imperfections, such as mismatched shadow gradients and edge blending issues. These artifacts indicate incomplete realism in the integration process, though they are not severe enough to obscure the overall coherence of the scene.",
