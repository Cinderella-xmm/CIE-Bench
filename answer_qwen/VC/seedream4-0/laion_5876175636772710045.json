      "question": "Is the man's left arm still wrapped around the woman's back, supporting her in a ballroom dance hold?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is seen from behind, and his left arm is clearly extended outward and positioned across the woman’s back, with his hand resting near her shoulder blade. This posture is consistent with a standard ballroom dance hold, where the man supports the woman by keeping his arm around her back to guide and balance her during movement. The positioning of the arm appears secure and supportive, which aligns with typical ballroom dance technique. Based on visual cues such as the angle and placement of the arm, combined with knowledge of ballroom dance postures, it can be concluded that the man’s left arm is indeed wrapped around the woman’s back.",

      "question": "Does the woman's right hand remain on the man's left shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s right hand is visibly placed on the man’s left shoulder, maintaining contact and balance as part of the dance hold. This is a common position in ballroom dancing, especially during turns or flowing movements, where the woman uses her hand to anchor herself to the partner. The hand placement is firm yet graceful, indicating an intentional and controlled pose. Comparing this to typical dance choreography, such hand placement supports stability and coordination between partners. There is no indication that the hand has moved away from the shoulder.",

      "question": "Is the woman's back arched backward with her right leg lifted off the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s back is slightly arched, giving her a poised and elegant posture typical of ballroom dancing. However, her right leg is not lifted off the ground; instead, it is planted firmly on the floor, with only the heel raised slightly, suggesting a step or pivot rather than a lift. Her left leg is the one that appears to be bearing more weight, while the right foot remains grounded. Therefore, although her back is arched, her right leg is not lifted. This conclusion is based on analyzing the alignment of her legs and feet, combined with knowledge of dance positions.",

      "question": "Is the man positioned with his back to the viewer while the woman faces slightly toward the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is clearly positioned with his back facing the viewer, as his head and shoulders are turned away from the camera. The woman, in contrast, is angled so that her face is visible and she is looking upward and slightly toward the camera. This positioning is consistent with a classic ballroom dance pose where the man leads from behind and the woman responds with an expressive facial orientation. The lighting and depth of field further emphasize the man’s back and the woman’s forward-facing expression. Thus, the description matches the visual evidence.",

      "question": "Does the woman's long blonde hair flow outward to the right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s long blonde hair is swept dynamically to the right side of the frame, likely due to the motion of the dance. The flow of the hair suggests movement, possibly from a spin or turn, and it extends gracefully beyond her shoulder into the right portion of the image. This effect is enhanced by the lighting and composition, which highlight the texture and direction of the hair. Given the physics of motion and the way hair behaves during dance, this outward flow is realistic and consistent with the scene.",

      "question": "Is the man's left foot forward and the woman's right heel raised off the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man’s left foot is indeed positioned forward relative to his right foot, indicating a forward step or lead in the dance. Meanwhile, the woman’s right heel is visibly raised, with her foot in a pointed position, suggesting she is either stepping or balancing on the ball of her foot. This posture is common in ballroom dancing for maintaining balance during transitions. Both observations are supported by the alignment of their feet and the angle of their bodies, which reflect coordinated dance movement. Therefore, both conditions are satisfied.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s head is tilted upward, and her gaze is directed toward the upper left portion of the frame. This upward tilt and directional focus are consistent with expressive ballroom dance poses, often used to convey emotion or elegance. Her eyes are clearly oriented in that direction, and the lighting highlights her facial features, reinforcing the sense of upward gaze. This positioning is also supported by the overall composition, where her line of sight adds dynamism to the scene. Thus, the visual evidence confirms the described head and eye orientation.",
