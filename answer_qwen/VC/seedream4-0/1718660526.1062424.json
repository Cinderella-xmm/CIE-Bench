      "question": "Are the black stripes evenly distributed across the body, head, and legs in the same pattern as the original knitted animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal is constructed from mosaic tiles, with each tile forming part of a larger pattern. The black stripes are composed of dark-colored tiles arranged in bands across the body, head, and legs. While the overall stripe pattern mimics that of a tiger or striped animal, the distribution appears less uniform due to the geometric nature of the tiles—some areas have gaps or irregular spacing between tiles, especially around joints and curves. In contrast, the original knitted animal (Image A) has smooth, continuous stripes formed by yarn, resulting in even and consistent striping. Therefore, although the general pattern is preserved, the evenness and continuity differ significantly due to the material and construction method.",

      "question": "Is the snout present with two clearly defined, dark circular nostrils positioned symmetrically on the upper portion of the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snout is clearly visible and shaped like that of a stylized animal. The nostrils are represented by dark tiles forming two distinct, rounded shapes located on the upper portion of the snout. These nostril shapes are symmetrical and well-defined, matching typical anatomical expectations for such an animal representation. The use of dark tiles ensures high contrast against the orange background, making them visually prominent. This matches the expected design based on common animal depictions and the visual clarity of the mosaic work.",

      "question": "Are the eyes large, round, and positioned symmetrically on the face, each consisting of a white outer ring and a central black pupil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes in Image B are indeed large and round, placed symmetrically on either side of the face. Each eye is composed of a white outer ring made from light-colored tiles, surrounding a central black pupil formed by darker tiles. This design closely resembles cartoonish or toy-like representations of animal eyes, which often emphasize expressiveness through large, round features. The symmetry and color contrast are maintained consistently, aligning with both aesthetic norms and the visual cues seen in the image.",

      "question": "Is the mouth a clearly visible curved line forming a smile below the snout, consistent with the original animal’s expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouth area is depicted as a subtle curved line formed by lighter-colored tiles beneath the snout. This curve suggests a smiling expression, similar to that seen in the original knitted animal. However, due to the mosaic texture, the line is not as smoothly defined as in the soft fabric version; instead, it consists of individual tiles that create a slightly jagged but still recognizable smile. Despite minor imperfections from the medium, the intent to convey a cheerful expression is clear and consistent with the original's demeanor.",

      "question": "Is the animal in a walking pose with the left front leg extended forward and the right front leg grounded behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the posture in Image B, the animal appears to be mid-stride. The left front leg is visibly extended forward, while the right front leg is positioned further back, suggesting movement. This stance is consistent with a walking gait. The positioning of the legs aligns with biomechanical expectations for quadrupedal animals in motion. Comparing this to Image A, the same walking pose is mirrored, indicating that the editing process preserved the dynamic posture. Thus, the pose is accurately maintained despite changes in material and texture.",

      "question": "Are there two small, rounded ears positioned symmetrically on top of the head, pointing slightly outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ears are clearly visible on the top of the head. They are small, rounded, and constructed from the same mosaic tiles as the rest of the body. Both ears are symmetrically placed and angled slightly outward, which is typical for many stylized animal representations. Their shape and placement match those in the original knitted animal, maintaining consistency in design. The use of mosaic tiles does not distort their form, so they remain recognizable and proportionate.",

      "question": "Is the sculpture placed on a surface with a visibly granular, uneven texture resembling natural sand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the sculpture in Image B rests on a raised platform made of what appears to be compacted sand. The surface exhibits a granular texture with visible particles and slight irregularities, characteristic of natural sand. The lighting enhances these details, casting fine shadows that emphasize the roughness. This contrasts with the smoother ground in Image A, where the knitted animal stands directly on sand without a raised structure. However, the current surface still convincingly mimics natural sand, even if elevated.",
