      "question": "Are the three distinct mountain peaks—two broad and one sharp—present and positioned in the same relative layout as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountainous background features a central, prominent peak with two flanking peaks that are more rounded and less defined. However, these peaks are not natural rock formations but instead form part of a fantastical creature's head and horns. The visual structure is clearly stylized and symbolic rather than realistic. In contrast, Image A shows three natural, geologically consistent peaks: two broader ones on either side and a sharper, more pointed peak in the center. These are real geological features shaped by erosion and tectonic forces. The arrangement in Image B has been artistically reinterpreted to serve as part of a mythical beast, altering both the shape and spatial relationship of the peaks. Therefore, while there may be a loose resemblance in silhouette, the peaks are not present in their original form or relative layout.",

      "question": "Is the lake located in the same basin with the same irregular shape, including the curved western edge and shallow extension toward the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of water that appears to be the lake is no longer a natural feature. Instead, it has been transformed into a reflective, heart-shaped mirror embedded in the chest of the mythical creature. This mirror reflects the sky and landscape, but its shape is highly stylized and symmetrical, lacking the organic, irregular contours seen in Image A. In Image A, the lake is a natural alpine tarn with a distinctly curved western shore and a shallow extension toward the viewer’s perspective. The transformation in Image B replaces this natural lake with a magical, symbolic element, fundamentally altering both its shape and function. Thus, the lake is not preserved in its original basin or shape.",

      "question": "Do the trails maintain their original routing pattern across the slopes, including their connection to the lake and convergence points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trails visible on the slopes have been reimagined as glowing, bioluminescent paths that follow the contours of the mythical creature’s body. These paths are not natural footpaths but appear to be energy lines or magical currents flowing over the terrain. In Image A, the trails are clearly visible as dirt paths winding through grassy slopes, converging near the lake and connecting various points of interest. The original trail network reflects human use and topography. In Image B, the trails are abstracted and integrated into the fantasy design, losing their realistic routing and purpose. They no longer connect to a physical lake or serve as hiking routes. Therefore, the original trail pattern is not maintained.",

      "question": "Are there visible human figures present near the shoreline of the lake, consistent with their placement in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, several small human figures can be observed near the shoreline of the lake, indicating hikers or visitors enjoying the natural setting. These figures provide scale and context for the landscape. In Image B, however, the shoreline has been replaced by the creature’s body, and no human figures are visible. The area where people were previously located is now occupied by the creature’s limbs and scales. Given the fantastical transformation, any human presence has been removed or obscured. There is no indication of humans in the scene, so the original placement of figures is not preserved.",

      "question": "Are the rocky outcrops and boulders visible along the shoreline and slopes, maintaining their original distribution and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, rocky outcrops and boulders are naturally distributed along the slopes and shoreline, consistent with glacial or erosional processes typical of alpine environments. These rocks vary in size and are scattered realistically. In Image B, the rocks have been incorporated into the anatomy of the mythical creature. For example, the creature’s skin texture includes stone-like elements, and some boulders appear to be part of its structure rather than independent geological features. The distribution and size of rocks are no longer natural but are instead designed to fit the creature’s form. As such, the original distribution and size of rocky outcrops are not preserved.",

      "question": "Is the green vegetation cover present across the slopes, maintaining its general distribution and density as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the slopes are covered in lush green vegetation, likely alpine grasses and mosses, which grow in patches and follow the natural contours of the terrain. The distribution is uneven, reflecting soil quality and exposure to sunlight. In Image B, while greenery is still present, it is now integrated into the creature’s body—moss grows on its back and limbs, suggesting a fusion between nature and myth. The vegetation appears more stylized and concentrated in specific areas (e.g., along the creature’s spine), rather than being uniformly distributed across the slopes. While green tones are maintained, the overall density and natural pattern of vegetation have been altered to serve the artistic vision. Thus, the original vegetation cover is not preserved.",

      "question": "Is the sky clear blue with scattered wispy clouds, matching the original atmospheric conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the sky is indeed clear blue with a few thin, wispy clouds, indicating fair weather and high altitude conditions typical of mountain regions. This contributes to the naturalistic and serene atmosphere of the scene. In Image B, while the lower portion of the sky retains a similar blue hue and cloud pattern, the upper right corner features a dramatic celestial display with stars, nebulae, and cosmic light effects. This suggests a surreal or otherworldly environment, inconsistent with the original atmospheric conditions. The addition of space-like elements transforms the sky from realistic to fantastical, breaking the continuity of the original scene. Therefore, the sky does not match the original atmospheric conditions.",
