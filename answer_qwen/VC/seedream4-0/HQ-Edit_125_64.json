      "question": "Is the pyramid visible in the background to the right of the Sphinx, with a clear triangular silhouette against the sunset sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a desert landscape at sunset, with a distinct pyramid visible on the right side of the frame. The pyramid has a sharp, triangular silhouette that stands out against the warm hues of the sky. This is consistent with the known geographical layout around the Giza Plateau, where the pyramids are positioned near the Sphinx. The visual clarity and angular shape confirm it is a pyramid, and its placement relative to the Sphinx matches typical representations. The lighting from the setting sun enhances the silhouette effect, making it clearly distinguishable.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned low on the horizon, directly behind the Sphinx, emitting a bright circular glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is indeed located low on the horizon, just behind the Sphinx's head and slightly to the right. It appears as a bright, glowing orb that emits a radiant light, casting illumination across the scene. While it is not perfectly centered behind the Sphinx, it is close enough to be considered 'directly behind' in a compositional sense. The glow contributes to the dramatic lighting, enhancing the mystical atmosphere. This positioning aligns with sunset imagery commonly associated with Egyptian monuments.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dense layer of clouds below the Sphinx, appearing illuminated with orange and pink hues from the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a thick, cloud-like formation beneath the Sphinx, which appears to be floating above it. These clouds are vividly colored in shades of orange, pink, and purple, consistent with the reflection of sunset light. The clouds are dense and layered, creating a surreal, ethereal atmosphere. Although real-world Sphinx images do not feature such clouds (as it is located in a desert), this artistic choice suggests a fantastical or symbolic representation. The illumination matches the color palette of the sky, indicating they are lit by the same sunset source.",

      "question": "Is the Sphinx facing toward the right side of the image, with its profile visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Sphinx in Image B is depicted in a profile view, facing toward the right side of the frame. Its head is turned to the right, showing the side of its face, including the eye, nose, and mouth. The wings and headdress also extend in alignment with this orientation. This is consistent with traditional depictions of the Sphinx, which typically faces eastward (toward the rising sun), but here it is shown facing right due to the composition. The profile is clearly visible, emphasizing its regal and mythical appearance.",

      "question": "Does the sky show a smooth gradient from warm orange near the horizon to cooler purple and pink tones at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B displays a rich, layered gradient. Near the horizon, the colors are dominated by warm oranges and yellows, typical of a sunset. As the sky ascends, the tones transition into deeper pinks and purples, especially in the upper regions. This gradient is smooth and continuous, contributing to the overall dramatic and serene mood of the scene. Such color transitions are common during twilight hours and are accurately represented here, enhancing the visual depth and realism of the image despite its fantastical elements.",

      "question": "Are there visible horizontal erosion lines and layered textures on the lower portion of the Sphinxâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower part of the Sphinx's body shows detailed texturing, including horizontal striations and layered patterns that resemble weathering or ancient stonework. These lines suggest erosion over time, similar to what might be seen on real stone monuments exposed to wind and sand. However, the texture also includes artistic embellishments, such as flowing fabric-like drapery and symbolic markings, which may blur the distinction between natural erosion and stylized design. Despite this, the presence of horizontal lines is evident and contributes to the aged, monumental appearance of the figure.",

      "question": "Is there sand visible around the base of the Sphinx, particularly near the front paws and lower body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sandy surface surrounding the Sphinx, especially noticeable near the front paws and lower torso. The sand appears soft and undisturbed, with gentle ripples and footprints, suggesting a desert environment. The texture contrasts with the more solid form of the Sphinx and the cloud layer beneath it. This detail reinforces the setting as a desert landscape, consistent with the location of the actual Sphinx in Egypt. The sand is illuminated by the sunset, adding warmth and depth to the foreground.",
