      "question": "Is the man still wearing a gray T-shirt and black pants while sitting cross-legged on the floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is not present at all. Instead, the image shows a hand holding a keychain shaped like a cartoon German Shepherd. There is no man visible in this image, so it is impossible for him to be wearing a gray T-shirt and black pants or sitting cross-legged. The absence of the man in Image B means that the original scene has been completely replaced by a new object (the keychain). Therefore, based on visual evidence and common sense, the man cannot be present in this edited image.",

      "question": "Are there still multiple bananas arranged in a pile between the man and the dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no bananas visible. The image focuses entirely on a hand holding a keychain shaped like a cartoon German Shepherd. The bananas, which were present in Image A, are absent here. The scene has been replaced with a close-up of the keychain, indicating that the bananas are no longer part of the composition. Thus, the pile of bananas is not present in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the background still plain and neutral with no additional decorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be plain and neutral, likely a light beige or off-white color. There are no visible decorations, patterns, or objects in the background other than the hand and the keychain. This matches the description of a simple, uncluttered backdrop commonly used in product photography. While the background is different from Image A (which had a similar neutral tone), it maintains the same aesthetic of simplicity and neutrality. Therefore, the background in Image B is indeed plain and neutral.",

      "question": "Does the keychain still depict a German Shepherd with tan and black markings, even in a chibi style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain features a stylized, cartoonish representation of a German Shepherd. It has tan and black markings consistent with the breed's typical coloring—tan body with black saddle and face markings. The design is simplified and exaggerated, characteristic of a 'chibi' or cute anime-style depiction. Despite the stylization, the breed-specific features such as pointed ears, black muzzle, and tail shape are recognizable. Thus, the keychain does depict a German Shepherd in a chibi style with accurate coloration.",

      "question": "Is the man still positioned next to the pile of bananas, with the dog (now a keychain) near the bananas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, neither the man nor the pile of bananas is present. The image only shows a hand holding a keychain shaped like a cartoon German Shepherd. The original elements—the man, the bananas, and their spatial arrangement—are entirely absent. The keychain is not near any bananas, and the man is not in the scene at all. Therefore, the spatial relationship described in the question does not exist in Image B. The entire composition has been changed, replacing the previous scene with a product shot of the keychain.",
