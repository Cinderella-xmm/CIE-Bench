      "question": "Are the ears upright and positioned symmetrically on top of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the llama's ears are clearly visible and stand upright. They are positioned on top of the head and appear to be symmetrical in shape and placement relative to each other. This symmetry is consistent with natural anatomy in llamas, where the ears are typically erect and balanced on either side of the head. There is no visual distortion or asymmetry that would suggest otherwise. The positioning aligns with typical animal morphology, especially when viewed from a frontal angle.",

      "question": "Are the dark-framed glasses positioned directly over the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no glasses present on the llama’s face. Instead, the llama wears an ornate metal headpiece that covers the area around the eyes and nose, resembling a decorative bridle or mask. This piece does not resemble glasses and lacks any transparent lenses or frame structure typical of eyewear. Therefore, the presence of dark-framed glasses as described in the question is incorrect. This conclusion is based on direct observation of the facial adornment and comparison with common knowledge of what glasses look like.",

      "question": "Is there a red patterned bandana wrapped around the forehead, above the glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no red patterned bandana visible on the llama’s forehead. Instead, the head is adorned with a metallic, intricately designed headpiece that appears to be made of silver or bronze, featuring runes and geometric patterns. This headpiece sits across the forehead and extends down over the snout. There is no red fabric or bandana present. The absence of such a bandana can be confirmed by examining the color and texture of the headwear—metallic and rigid, not cloth-like or red. Thus, the description in the question does not match the visual content.",

      "question": "Is the white fur texture visible on the head and upper neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, in Image B, the white fur texture is clearly visible on the head and upper neck of the llama. The fur appears soft and dense, particularly around the muzzle and along the sides of the head. The lighting highlights the natural texture and slight variations in fur length, which are characteristic of alpacas or llamas. Even though the subject is wearing elaborate accessories, the underlying fur remains visible, especially in areas not covered by the braids or headgear. This observation is consistent with real-world knowledge of camelid fur, which is typically thick and woolly.",

      "question": "Do the braids extend downward from the neck area and appear to be made from the subject’s own fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two large braids extend downward from the sides of the head and neck. These braids are long, tightly woven, and have a texture and color consistent with the subject’s natural white fur. The way they are styled—starting at the base of the skull and running down the front of the body—suggests they are indeed made from the llama’s own fur, rather than artificial extensions. Furthermore, the integration of the braids into the overall costume design (including metal rings and beads) supports the idea that they are part of a cultural or ceremonial styling using natural materials. This is consistent with traditional practices in some cultures where animal or human hair is braided for ritual or aesthetic purposes.",

      "question": "Is the head turned slightly to the left, with the gaze facing forward toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the llama’s head is turned slightly to its right (which corresponds to the viewer’s left), but its eyes are looking directly forward, engaging with the viewer. This creates a sense of awareness and focus. The angle of the head is subtle but noticeable—the left ear is more prominent, and the jawline tilts slightly toward the right. However, the direction of the gaze remains centered, suggesting attention toward the camera. This combination of head tilt and forward-facing eyes is common in portraiture to create depth and personality. Based on this analysis, the head is turned slightly to the left (from the viewer’s perspective), and the gaze is forward.",
