    "Question": "Q1: Is the text 'MICHAEL KORS' present in uppercase letters below the 12 o'clock position on the dial?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the watch face is clearly visible, and the brand name 'MICHAEL KORS' is positioned just below the 12 o'clock marker. The text is rendered in uppercase letters, consistent with typical branding conventions for luxury watches. This detail is preserved from the original design and remains legible despite the stylized cartoon context of the image. The font style and placement match standard watch dial layouts, where brand names are often centered beneath the 12 o'clock position. Based on visual inspection and common design practices, this confirms the presence of the text in uppercase.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are there three subdials located at the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions, with the 3 o'clock subdial marked 24-hour scale, the 6 o'clock subdial marked seconds, and the 9 o'clock subdial marked minutes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the watch dial features three subdials arranged at approximately the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions. The subdial at the 3 o'clock position displays numbers up to 24, indicating a 24-hour format. The subdial at the 6 o'clock position shows markings from 0 to 60, which is typical for a seconds counter. The subdial at the 9 o'clock position has markings from 0 to 30, suggesting it measures elapsed minutes (common in chronographs). These configurations align with standard chronograph functions. Although the image is stylized as a comic panel, the details of the subdials remain accurate and consistent with real-world watch designs. Comparing with Image A, the same layout and markings are present, confirming the accuracy of this configuration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a rectangular date window at the 4 o'clock position showing the number '18'?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a small rectangular window is visible near the 4 o'clock position on the dial. Inside this window, the number '18' is clearly displayed. This matches the typical placement and appearance of a date window on many wristwatches, particularly those with a classic or dressy design. The positioning and shape are consistent with the original watch shown in Image A, where the same feature is present. Despite the artistic rendering of the second image as part of a comic strip, the date window retains its realistic form and content, including the correct number '18'.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the watch have a black leather strap with an embossed crocodile texture and visible stitching along the edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the watch strap is depicted in black and exhibits a textured surface that resembles crocodile skin, a common design element in premium leather straps. Fine lines and patterns consistent with embossing are visible across the strap's surface. Additionally, stitching along the edges of the strap can be observed, which is characteristic of high-quality leather watch bands. These features are consistent with the original watch in Image A, where the same strap design is present. Even though Image B is illustrated in a cartoon style, the artist has preserved these key details accurately, maintaining realism in the representation of the strap.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the watch case and dial finished in a silver metallic tone with a brushed texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the watch case and dial appear to have a silver metallic finish. The surface of the dial shows subtle horizontal lines indicative of a brushed metal texture, which is commonly used in luxury timepieces to enhance durability and aesthetics. The case also reflects light in a way consistent with polished stainless steel or similar silver-toned materials. This finish is preserved from Image A, where the same brushed texture and coloration are evident. The comic-style rendering does not alter the fundamental material appearance, allowing the metallic sheen and texture to remain recognizable.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is there a continuous minute track around the outer edge of the dial with markings from 5 to 60?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the outer edge of the dial features a minute track with tick marks and numerals. The markings include numbers such as 5, 10, 15, ..., up to 60, arranged in a circular fashion around the dialâ€™s perimeter. This is a standard feature on chronograph watches to allow precise time reading. The spacing and labeling are consistent with typical minute tracks found on analog watches. When compared to Image A, the same minute track is present, confirming its inclusion. The artistic style of Image B does not obscure these markings, and they remain clearly visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the numbers 12, 2, 4, 8, and 10 displayed as Arabic numerals at their respective positions on the dial?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hour markers at 12, 2, 4, 8, and 10 are clearly represented using Arabic numerals. These digits are positioned at their corresponding locations on the dial and are easily readable. The use of Arabic numerals at these positions is a common design choice in modern wristwatches, especially those aiming for clarity and elegance. This feature is consistent with Image A, where the same numerals are present. The cartoon illustration maintains the legibility of these numbers, ensuring they are not altered or omitted.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q8: Are there two pushers and a crown located on the right side of the watch case?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right side of the watch case shows three distinct components: one crown (the larger, ridged knob) and two smaller pushers positioned above and below it. These elements are characteristic of a chronograph watch, where the crown is used for setting time and the pushers control the start, stop, and reset functions of the chronograph. The placement and design of these components are consistent with the original watch in Image A. Despite the stylized nature of the comic panel, the artist has accurately depicted the functional elements of the watch case, preserving their count and arrangement.",
