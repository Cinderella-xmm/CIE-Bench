      "question": "Is the framed landscape painting with a dark wooden frame and a scene depicting ducks near water present above the sofa?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a framed painting is visible on the wall directly above the sofa. The frame is dark, likely black or dark brown, matching the description of a 'dark wooden frame.' The painting depicts a natural scene with greenery, water, and what appear to be ducks resting near the water's edge. This aligns with the description of a landscape featuring ducks near water. Based on visual analysis and common knowledge of typical landscape paintings, this matches the described content. The positioning of the painting above the sofa is consistent in both Image A and Image B, confirming its presence.",

      "question": "Is the wall behind the sofa a consistent cream color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall behind the sofa appears to be uniformly colored in a light, neutral tone that can be described as cream or off-white. There are no visible variations in hue or texture across the wall surface, suggesting consistency. This observation is supported by the absence of shadows or discoloration that might indicate patchiness. Comparing with Image A, where the same wall is visible, it also appears consistently cream-colored, indicating that the wall’s color has not changed due to the transformation of the sofa. Therefore, based on visual cues and continuity between images, the wall remains consistently cream.",

      "question": "Is the floor covered in a light beige textured carpet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor beneath the sofa is covered with a carpet that exhibits a uniform, light beige or tan color. The surface has a visible texture consistent with loop or low-pile carpeting, which is commonly used in living rooms. The texture appears slightly coarse, supporting the description of a 'textured' carpet. This is consistent with the flooring seen in Image A, where the same carpet is visible under the original leather sofa. Since the flooring has not changed despite the dramatic transformation of the sofa, the carpet remains unchanged. Thus, the floor is indeed covered in a light beige textured carpet.",

      "question": "Is there a white baseboard molding running along the bottom of the wall behind the sofa?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a clean, white baseboard molding is clearly visible along the bottom edge of the wall, separating the wall from the carpeted floor. It runs horizontally and is consistent in width and color throughout the visible portion of the wall. This feature is also present in Image A, where the same white baseboard is visible. The presence of the baseboard suggests standard interior finishing, and its continuity between the two images confirms it has not been altered. Therefore, the baseboard molding is present and matches the description.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the far left side of the frame, a partial view of another piece of furniture is visible. This object has a similar dark brown color and curved armrest design consistent with the original leather armchair seen in Image A. Although the sofa in Image B has been transformed into a fantastical creature-like structure, the surrounding environment—including adjacent furniture—remains unchanged. The presence of the armchair’s backrest and armrest in the same position as in Image A confirms that part of the second brown leather armchair is still visible. This is consistent with the layout of the room before the edit.",

      "question": "Are soft shadows visible beneath the sofa, consistent with indoor ambient lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, soft, diffused shadows are visible beneath the sofa, particularly along the edges closest to the floor. These shadows are subtle and lack harsh contrasts, which is typical of indoor ambient lighting, such as overhead ceiling lights or lamps. The shadow pattern follows the shape of the sofa’s legs and base, indicating consistent light direction from above. The presence of these shadows is also observed in Image A, where the original leather sofa casts similar soft shadows. This continuity suggests that the lighting conditions have not changed, and thus, the shadows remain consistent with indoor ambient lighting.",
