      "question": "Is there a river running down the center of the image from the foreground to the distant mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a prominent waterway is visible running through the center of the composition, extending from the foreground toward the background where the mountains are located. The water surface is depicted with parallel blue and white lines that converge toward the horizon, suggesting depth and perspective. This visual structure clearly indicates a river-like feature guiding the viewer’s eye into the scene. The alignment and direction of the waterway confirm it flows centrally from front to back, consistent with the description of a river running from the foreground to the distant mountains. Based on visual cues such as the converging lines and central placement, this is a strong representation of a river.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two large mountain peaks visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a series of stylized, geometric mountain forms. On both the left and right sides of the image, there are distinct, sharply angled peaks that rise above the surrounding terrain. These peaks are larger than the other mountain elements and are positioned symmetrically across the central axis of the image. Their size, shape, and placement suggest they are dominant features of the landscape. While the style is abstract and angular, the visual hierarchy clearly identifies two major peaks—one on the left and one on the right—consistent with the description. Therefore, based on their prominence and positioning, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Is there a bright circular light source positioned near the center of the horizon line in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, near the center of the horizon line, there is a distinct, bright white circular shape. This element is surrounded by warm yellow and orange hues, which radiate outward, resembling the glow of sunlight. Its position at the horizon and its luminous quality strongly suggest it represents the sun, either rising or setting. This is a common artistic convention for depicting celestial bodies in landscape scenes. Given the context of the sky’s color gradient and the light’s placement, it is reasonable to conclude that this is a bright circular light source (the sun) located near the center of the horizon.",

      "question": "Are there trees present on both sides of the river, extending along the banks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the riverbanks on both the left and right sides are lined with stylized tree shapes. These trees are represented using geometric forms with triangular canopies, typical of coniferous trees, and are colored in various autumnal tones such as red, orange, and green. They are arranged in clusters along the edges of the river, creating a continuous line of vegetation from the foreground toward the background. This arrangement indicates that trees are indeed present on both sides of the river and extend along its banks. The symmetry and repetition of these forms support the conclusion that the river is flanked by trees.",

      "question": "Are there visible rock formations or landmasses within the river, breaking the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the river appears as a smooth, patterned surface composed of parallel lines, with no interruptions or irregularities that would suggest rocks or landmasses emerging from the water. The entire waterway is uniformly rendered without any raised features or breaks in the surface. In contrast to natural rivers that often contain islands or submerged rocks, this stylized depiction maintains a clean, uninterrupted flow. There are no visual cues such as elevation changes, shadows, or texture variations that would indicate the presence of rock formations or landmasses within the river. Therefore, based on the absence of such features, the answer is no.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the river reflect the trees and sky above it, maintaining a mirrored image across the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the river is depicted with a pattern of horizontal blue and white stripes that create a sense of depth and movement but do not show reflections of the surrounding environment. A mirrored reflection would require the water surface to display inverted images of the trees, mountains, and sky. However, the water here is abstractly represented with uniform lines radiating toward the horizon, lacking any visual elements that resemble reflections. The design prioritizes geometric abstraction over realism, so realistic mirroring effects are absent. Therefore, while the river has a reflective appearance in terms of brightness, it does not maintain a mirrored image of the surroundings.",

      "question": "Are the trees on the riverbanks colored in warm autumn tones such as red, orange, and yellow, with dark green conifers interspersed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees along the riverbanks are rendered in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow, which are characteristic of autumn foliage. These warm-toned trees are interspersed with darker green, triangular-shaped trees that resemble conifers. The color palette and distribution of these trees align with the typical visual representation of an autumn forest, where deciduous trees change color while evergreens remain green. Although the style is abstract and geometric, the use of color and form clearly indicates the presence of both autumn-colored trees and dark green conifers. Thus, the description matches the visual content.",
