      "question": "Does the elephant in the edited image retain large, fan-shaped ears that extend outward from the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is constructed from LEGO bricks, and its ears are visibly large and broad, extending outward from the head. While the construction is blocky due to the nature of LEGO, the overall shape mimics the large, fan-like ears characteristic of African elephants. This design choice aligns with real-world knowledge that African elephants have significantly larger ears compared to Asian elephants, which helps them regulate body temperature. The visual cues in the LEGO model support the presence of large, fan-shaped ears despite the stylized form.",

      "question": "Are the elephant’s tusks long, curved, and off-white in color, extending downward from the upper jaw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tusks of the LEGO elephant are clearly visible and appear long and curved, extending downward from the upper jaw. They are rendered in a light, off-white color consistent with natural ivory. Although the material is plastic and stylized, the shape and placement match the biological features of an African elephant’s tusks. The curvature and length are proportionally accurate relative to the rest of the model, reinforcing the realistic depiction within the constraints of LEGO design.",

      "question": "Is the elephant’s skin depicted with deep wrinkles and folds, particularly on the trunk, legs, and ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO elephant in Image B does not display deep wrinkles and folds typical of real elephant skin. Instead, its surface is composed of smooth, flat brick surfaces with no detailed texturing. Real elephants have highly wrinkled skin for moisture retention and thermoregulation, but this feature cannot be replicated in a LEGO model without specialized pieces or techniques. Therefore, while the general form is preserved, the fine details like wrinkles are absent due to the medium's limitations.",

      "question": "Do the elephant’s feet show five distinct toes on each foot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet of the LEGO elephant are simplified and do not show individual toes. The construction uses solid blocks to represent the feet, lacking the detail necessary to depict five distinct toes per foot. In reality, African elephants have five toes on their front feet and four on their back feet, but such anatomical precision is not feasible in a LEGO model at this scale. Thus, the absence of visible toes is expected and consistent with the stylized nature of the build.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack is part of the LEGO set and is built using red bricks. It appears to be a rich, saturated red, consistent with the color of the backpack in Image A. The LEGO version maintains the same hue and intensity, suggesting that the designer aimed to preserve the visual characteristics of the original object. Although it is made of plastic rather than fabric, the color saturation matches closely enough to be considered equivalent.",

      "question": "Is the backpack present as a separate object positioned near the elephant in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack is integrated into the LEGO model as a component attached to the elephant’s back, rather than being a separate object placed nearby. In contrast, in Image A, the backpack is a standalone item located beside the elephant. The edited image transforms the backpack into part of the elephant’s structure, likely to maintain scale and aesthetic consistency within the LEGO diorama. This indicates that the backpack is not positioned separately but is instead incorporated into the model.",

      "question": "Is the animal clearly identifiable as an African elephant based on its ear size, tusk shape, and overall body structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the LEGO model in Image B is clearly identifiable as an African elephant. The large, fan-shaped ears are a defining feature distinguishing African elephants from Asian elephants. The tusks are long and curved, consistent with African elephant morphology. Additionally, the overall body structure—large and robust with a high shoulder hump—is typical of African elephants. Even though the model is stylized, these key morphological traits are preserved, allowing for accurate identification based on world knowledge of elephant taxonomy.",
