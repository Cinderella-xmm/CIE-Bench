      "question": "Is the mountain depicted as a symmetrical, perfectly conical shape with a pointed peak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain inside the glass bowl appears to be stylized and artistic rather than naturalistic. The peak is sharp and pointed, but the overall shape is not perfectly symmetrical. Instead, it features multiple ridges and jagged peaks, suggesting a more complex, rugged terrain typical of alpine ranges rather than a single, smooth cone. This contrasts with the idealized, symmetrical cone often associated with Mount Fuji in real-world imagery. Therefore, while there is a central peak, the mountain lacks perfect symmetry.",

      "question": "Does the summit of the mountain have a continuous white snow cap covering the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the summit of the mountain within the glass bowl is covered in what appears to be artificial snow or glitter, giving it a bright white appearance. However, this coverage is not entirely uniform—there are visible patches where the underlying material (possibly gray or silver) shows through, especially along the ridges and slopes. While the top is predominantly white, the snow cap is not continuous or seamless, indicating an artistic representation rather than a realistic one. In contrast, natural snow caps on mountains like Mount Fuji typically form a continuous layer at high altitudes due to persistent cold temperatures and accumulation over time.",

      "question": "Is there a clear, mirror-like reflection of the mountain in the lake below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom portion of the glass bowl contains water that reflects the miniature landscape above. The reflection is present but not perfectly mirror-like; it is slightly distorted due to the curvature of the glass and the shallow depth of the water. Additionally, the surface of the water shows ripples and distortions, which prevent a crisp, accurate reflection. While some elements of the mountain and trees are mirrored, the clarity is compromised by the physical limitations of the setup. In comparison, natural lakes like those near Mount Fuji can produce near-perfect reflections under calm conditions, but here the reflection is intentionally stylized and imperfect.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small structures or buildings positioned along the edge of the lake, between the water and the mountain base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, in Image B, there are several small, model-like houses located along the shore of the miniature lake inside the glass bowl. These structures resemble wooden cabins with snow-covered roofs and are clearly placed between the water and the base of the mountain. They are part of the diorama-style scene, designed to mimic a winter village setting. This is consistent with common decorative terrariums or snow globes that include tiny buildings for aesthetic appeal. In contrast, such structures are not visible in Image A, which depicts a natural landscape without human-made buildings near the shoreline.",

      "question": "Is the sky visible above the mountain, appearing as a solid or gradient blue area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky visible above the mountain inside the glass bowl is a deep blue color, transitioning from lighter to darker shades toward the top. This suggests a gradient effect, likely created digitally or through lighting to simulate a clear day. The sky is unobstructed and forms a backdrop behind the mountain, contributing to the illusion of depth. This matches the visual characteristics of a clear sky in outdoor scenes, though in this case, it is likely a background image used in the diorama. Compared to Image A, where the sky is also a vivid blue with minimal clouds, both images share a similar atmospheric quality, but Image B's sky is more stylized and uniform.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible layers on the mountain’s slopes, showing a transition from white snow at the top to darker rock and then to green/brown vegetation below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain slopes do show a layered appearance, but the materials used are artificial. The top is covered in white 'snow' (likely glitter), followed by grayish-silver textured surfaces representing rock. Below that, there are miniature trees and shrubs in varying shades of green and brown, simulating vegetation. While these layers suggest a vertical zonation similar to real mountains, they are not natural transitions but rather deliberate design choices in a crafted scene. In contrast, Image A shows a natural progression of snow, exposed rock, and forested areas on Mount Fuji, which reflects real ecological and geological gradients. Thus, while Image B mimics layering, it does so through artificial means rather than actual environmental variation.",
