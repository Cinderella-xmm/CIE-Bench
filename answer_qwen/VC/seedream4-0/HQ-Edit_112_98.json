      "question": "Is the dark brown tree branch on which the bird is perched clearly visible and positioned in the same location as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark brown tree branch is indeed clearly visible. It extends diagonally across the lower portion of the frame, supporting the bird. The branch's texture, including its rough bark and natural curvature, is consistent with typical cherry tree branches. Comparing this to Image A, the branch appears to occupy a similar spatial position—running from the bottom-left toward the center-right—suggesting it has been preserved in both images. However, due to the fantastical transformation of the bird and added visual elements like glowing effects and floral wings, there may be subtle differences in lighting or perspective. Nonetheless, based on the structural alignment and continuity of the branch’s placement relative to surrounding blossoms and leaves, it can be concluded that the branch is in the same general location as in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the pink five-petaled cherry blossoms with visible yellow stamens and red centers still present in the scene, particularly near the bird and along the branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, numerous pink five-petaled cherry blossoms are visible throughout the scene. These flowers exhibit distinct features such as delicate petals, prominent yellow stamens radiating from the center, and reddish-pink centers, consistent with real cherry blossoms (Prunus spp.). They are clustered along the branches, especially near the bird and in the foreground, maintaining their natural arrangement. Compared to Image A, where the same floral elements appear in similar locations and forms, the presence and structure of these blossoms remain unchanged in Image B. The only difference is that some blossoms now appear integrated into the bird’s wings or tail, but the original floral characteristics are preserved in the environment. Thus, the blossoms are still present and recognizable.",

      "question": "Is the bird (or its transformed spirit form) positioned on the same branch, in the same central-left location, facing toward the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird—now transformed into a magical, ethereal being with translucent pink wings adorned with cherry blossom patterns—is perched on the same dark brown branch as in Image A. Its body occupies the central-left region of the frame, just as the original bird did. The orientation of the bird remains consistent: it faces toward the left side of the frame, with its head turned slightly forward. Despite the fantastical changes—including glowing eyes, flowing feathers, and floral embellishments—the spatial positioning relative to the branch and background elements aligns closely with the original. This suggests that while the bird’s appearance has been artistically altered, its placement within the composition has been maintained for visual continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there fresh green leaves with curled tips and visible veins growing from the branches, particularly near the bird and in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several fresh green leaves are visible sprouting from the branches, especially around the bird and in the foreground. These leaves display characteristic signs of new growth: light green coloration, slightly curled tips, and discernible venation patterns. Their placement mirrors that seen in Image A, where young foliage accompanies blooming cherry blossoms. The presence of such leaves supports the seasonal context of early spring. Although the artistic style enhances their vibrancy and detail, they retain botanical realism. Therefore, the leaves are not only present but also accurately rendered in terms of form and location.",

      "question": "Is the sunlight originating from the upper left, casting a warm golden glow across the scene and creating soft highlights on the bird and blossoms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting direction is consistent with a source located in the upper left corner of the frame. This is evident from the warm golden hues illuminating the top edges of the blossoms, the bird’s feathers, and the branches. Soft highlights are visible on the translucent wings and the bird’s body, suggesting directional illumination. Additionally, the glow creates a gentle gradient across the sky and enhances the luminosity of the floral details. Comparing this to Image A, the lighting setup is nearly identical—both images use the same angle and quality of light to evoke a serene, sunrise-like atmosphere. The warmth and diffusion of light contribute to the dreamlike ambiance, confirming that the sunlight origin and effect have been preserved.",

      "question": "Does the background contain softly blurred pink cherry blossoms and dark tree branches, forming a layered depth effect behind the main subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a bokeh effect with out-of-focus pink cherry blossoms and darker tree branches, creating a sense of depth. This shallow depth of field draws attention to the bird in the foreground while maintaining environmental context. The blurred elements are consistent with those in Image A, where similar compositional techniques were used to emphasize the subject. The layering of soft blooms and silhouetted branches adds dimensionality and reinforces the natural setting. Even though Image B includes more fantastical elements, the background retains its original aesthetic and structural qualities, ensuring visual coherence between the two images.",
