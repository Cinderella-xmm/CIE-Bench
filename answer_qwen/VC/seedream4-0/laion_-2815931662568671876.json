      "question": "Is the coarse, slightly cracked texture of the largest tortilla chip retained, including visible salt crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the largest tortilla chip is depicted as a cartoon character with exaggerated features such as eyes, an eyepatch, and limbs. The surface texture is stylized and smooth, lacking the fine details like cracks and salt crystals that would be present in a real baked tortilla chip. In reality, baked tortilla chips typically have a rough, slightly uneven surface due to the baking process, and visible salt crystals are common on their surface. However, in this edited image, the chip's texture has been simplified and smoothed for animation purposes, which eliminates realistic textural details. Therefore, the coarse, cracked texture and visible salt crystals are not retained.",

      "question": "Is the golden-brown color of the largest tortilla chip preserved, with natural tonal variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The largest tortilla chip in Image B is rendered in a uniform light tan or beige color, consistent with its cartoon style. While it does have some shading to suggest depth, the tonal variation seen in real baked tortilla chips—such as darker brown spots from baking or slight gradients—is absent. Real tortilla chips often display natural variations in color due to uneven heating during baking. In contrast, the chip in Image B has a flat, consistent tone without the nuanced color shifts typical of real food items. Thus, while the general color palette is similar, the natural tonal variation is not preserved.",

      "question": "Is the chunky, uneven texture of the guacamole mound preserved, showing visible avocado pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guacamole is anthropomorphized into a character with facial features and limbs, sitting at a table with other guacamole figures. Despite this personification, the mound retains a somewhat lumpy and textured appearance, suggesting chunks of avocado. However, the texture is simplified and stylized rather than photorealistic. In real guacamole, one would expect to see distinct chunks of avocado flesh, seeds, and possibly bits of onion or tomato. While the overall impression of chunkiness is maintained, the specific detail of visible avocado pieces is abstracted for artistic effect. Therefore, the texture is suggestive but not accurately preserved in terms of realistic detail.",

      "question": "Is the green-yellow gradient of the guacamole preserved, showing natural avocado color variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The guacamole in Image B displays a range of green hues, from lighter lime greens to deeper forest greens, which mimics the natural color variation found in real mashed avocado. There are also subtle yellow tones that reflect the natural pigmentation of avocado flesh. While the colors are stylized and not photorealistic, they do capture the essence of the green-yellow gradient seen in fresh guacamole. The cartoon rendering still manages to represent the natural color transition expected in real guacamole, even if it is exaggerated for visual appeal. Thus, the gradient and color variation are reasonably preserved within the context of the artistic style.",

      "question": "Are the chip and guacamole rendered with realistic material properties, avoiding glossy or plastic-like finishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the tortilla chip and the guacamole are part of a cartoon illustration with exaggerated features and stylized textures. The chip lacks the matte, slightly rough finish of a real baked chip and instead appears smooth and uniformly colored, resembling a plastic or animated object. Similarly, the guacamole, while textured, has a soft, almost rubbery appearance due to the cartoon rendering. Real guacamole has a moist, slightly oily surface, and tortilla chips have a dry, crisp look. These realistic material properties are sacrificed for the sake of animation and humor. Therefore, neither the chip nor the guacamole exhibits realistic material properties; instead, they appear more like toy-like or plastic objects.",
