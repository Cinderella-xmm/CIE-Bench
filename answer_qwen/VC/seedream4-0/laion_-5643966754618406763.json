      "question": "Does the edited image retain the deep, blocky lug pattern of the tire treads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tires are mounted on a mechanical, steampunk-style vehicle resembling a turtle. The tread pattern on these tires is visibly deep and features large, blocky lugs, which are characteristic of off-road or rock-crawling tires. This design is consistent with the 'Super Swamper' style tires known for aggressive traction in rough terrain. The visual cues—such as the pronounced, angular blocks and wide spacing between them—indicate that the lug pattern has been preserved. There is no sign of smoothing or alteration to the tread geometry. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and common knowledge of such tire designs, the deep, blocky lug pattern is retained.",

      "question": "Is the embossed text \"ROCKS TIRE\" and \"SUPER SWAMPER\" visible on the sidewalls of the tires?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tires are part of a larger mechanical construct, and their sidewalls are partially obscured by the vehicle's body and suspension components. However, upon close inspection, particularly on the front-left tire, faint embossed lettering can be seen. The text appears to include 'ROCKS TIRE' and 'SUPER SWAMPER', though it is less clearly legible than in Image A due to lighting angles and shadows. In contrast, Image A shows the tires stacked cleanly, allowing full visibility of the sidewall text. The presence of this text in Image B, despite reduced clarity, suggests it has been retained. Thus, while not perfectly sharp, the embossed text is still present and identifiable.",

      "question": "Are the five-spoke designs of the wheel hubs still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheel hubs are clearly visible and feature a distinct five-spoke design. Each spoke radiates from the center of the hub, forming a symmetrical star-like pattern. This matches the hub design seen in Image A, where the same five-spoke configuration is evident. The design is consistent across all four wheels in Image B, indicating that the original hub structure has been preserved during the editing process. The metallic finish and central bolt pattern also align with the original design, confirming continuity in the wheel construction.",

      "question": "Is the matte, rubber-textured surface of the tires maintained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tires in Image B exhibit a dark, non-reflective surface typical of rubber materials used in off-road tires. The texture appears slightly coarse, consistent with a matte finish, and there are no glossy or shiny areas that would suggest a different material. This contrasts with polished or synthetic surfaces, reinforcing the perception of a realistic rubber texture. While the lighting in Image B highlights some contours more than in Image A, the overall surface quality remains consistent with the original tires' appearance. Therefore, the matte, rubber-textured surface is maintained.",

      "question": "Are the tread blocks evenly spaced and proportionally consistent with the original tires?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tread blocks on the tires are uniformly shaped and spaced, matching the aggressive, chunky pattern seen in Image A. The blocks appear to maintain the same relative size and arrangement, suggesting proportional consistency. The symmetry and alignment of the tread elements across all four tires indicate careful preservation of the original design. Even though the tires are now mounted on a complex vehicle, the tread geometry remains unchanged, supporting the conclusion that the spacing and proportions have been accurately maintained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A displays four tires stacked in a pyramid formation: one on top, two in the middle, and one at the base. In Image B, the vehicle has four tires—two at the front and two at the rear—mounted on axles. Each tire is clearly visible and corresponds to one of the original tires. Although the tires are now integrated into a mechanical creature rather than being stacked, their number remains exactly four. Therefore, the count matches the original, even if their configuration has changed.",
