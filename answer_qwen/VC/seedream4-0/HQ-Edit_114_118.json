      "question": "Does the ship retain exactly three masts, with sails arranged in tiers on each mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is enclosed within a glass dome and appears as a detailed model. Observing the structure of the ship, there are clearly three main vertical masts: the foremast, mainmast, and mizzenmast. Each mast supports multiple sails stacked vertically in tiers, consistent with historical sailing ship design. The sails are arranged in a tiered fashion—such as topsails and courses—on each mast, which aligns with the typical configuration of a full-rigged ship. This arrangement is visible despite the scale reduction due to the model format. Therefore, based on visual evidence and maritime knowledge, the ship retains exactly three masts with tiered sails.",

      "question": "Is the ship’s hull shaped with a raised stern and a decorated, upward-curving prow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hull of the ship in Image B shows a classic galleon-style design. The stern is visibly elevated and ornate, featuring decorative elements typical of ships from the Age of Sail. The bow (prow) is also curved upward and appears to have intricate carvings or embellishments, consistent with historical naval architecture. Even though it is a model, these features are preserved in detail, indicating that the ship has both a raised stern and an upward-curving prow. This design was common for ships intended to project power and elegance, such as warships or royal vessels.",

      "question": "Are there multiple sails on each of the three masts, with at least two tiers per mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the ship in Image B, each of the three masts—foremast, mainmast, and mizzenmast—supports multiple sails. On each mast, there are clearly at least two tiers of sails: lower sails (such as courses) and upper sails (like topsails). For example, the mainmast has a large lower sail and a smaller upper one, and similarly, the foremast and mizzenmast show this layered structure. This multi-tiered sail arrangement is characteristic of a fully rigged ship, and it is faithfully represented in the model. Thus, the condition of having at least two tiers per mast is satisfied.",

      "question": "Are there at least five seagulls visible in flight around the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several seagulls are depicted flying in the sky around the ship. Counting them carefully, there are at least seven distinct birds visible in flight—some near the top right, others near the left side and above the ship. These birds are rendered with realistic wingspan and posture, suggesting active flight. Even though they appear slightly smaller due to perspective and distance, their number exceeds five. This is consistent with the natural behavior of seabirds following ships, especially during sunset or sunrise scenes like this one.",

      "question": "Is the ship oriented such that the bow points toward the left side of the image and is slightly elevated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ship in Image B is positioned with its bow (front) pointing toward the left side of the frame. Additionally, the bow is slightly elevated relative to the stern, creating a gentle upward tilt. This orientation is typical for ships shown in motion or in dynamic poses, even in models. The angle gives a sense of forward movement, possibly simulating sailing into the wind. This alignment is maintained despite being inside a glass dome, and the model's placement on the wavy resin base supports this angled stance.",

      "question": "Are there visible portholes along the sides of the ship’s hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the sides of the ship's hull in Image B, there are small, evenly spaced rectangular openings along the gunwale. These resemble portholes, which were commonly used on historical ships for ventilation, lighting, and cannon ports. Although the model may simplify details, these features are present and aligned in rows, matching the expected layout of a 17th- or 18th-century warship. Their presence is consistent with both visual cues and historical shipbuilding practices.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ship positioned above the surface of the water/resin layer, appearing to float?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is placed atop a translucent blue resin layer designed to mimic ocean waves. The hull is not touching the base of the resin but is instead suspended slightly above it, supported by internal structure or modeling technique. The resin is sculpted to look like waves, and the ship sits within this wave-like formation, giving the illusion of floating. This is a common artistic choice in display models to simulate buoyancy and movement. The visual effect suggests flotation rather than resting directly on the surface.",
