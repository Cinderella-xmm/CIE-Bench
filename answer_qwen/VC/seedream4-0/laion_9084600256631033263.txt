    "Question": "Q1: Is the 'DATSUN' text visibly present and centered on the front of the decanter?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembling a car is actually a highly reflective, metallic decanter shaped like a Datsun 2000 roadster. The front of the decanter features the word 'DATSUN' embossed in capital letters, positioned just above the grille area. The text is clearly visible due to the reflective surface and is aligned horizontally along the centerline of the front face of the decanter. Given that this is a stylized representation of a car turned into a decanter, the placement of the brand name follows the original car's design logic, where the manufacturer's name is typically centered on the hood or grille. Therefore, based on visual analysis and common automotive branding practices, the 'DATSUN' text is both visible and centrally located.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the '240Z' script visible on the side of the decanter near the front wheel well?",
    "explanation": "The side of the decanter in Image B shows the model designation '2000' written in script just behind the front wheel well, not '240Z'. This is consistent with the actual model being represented — a Datsun 2000 (also known as the Fairlady Z), which predates the more famous 240Z. The '240Z' was introduced later, so it would not be accurate for this specific vehicle model. Furthermore, the text on the decanter clearly reads '2000', confirming the correct model designation. Thus, the '240Z' script is not present.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the decanter maintain the long hood and short rear deck proportions of the original car?",
    "explanation": "The original Datsun 2000 roadster has a classic sports car silhouette characterized by a long hood and a short rear deck — a design trait common in vintage convertibles to emphasize engine presence and balance. In Image B, the decanter preserves this proportionality. The front section (hood) is elongated relative to the rear portion, which is compact and tapers toward the back. This is evident from the curvature of the body and the placement of the wheels. Even though the object is a decorative decanter, its form closely mimics the original car’s proportions, suggesting intentional design fidelity. Therefore, the decanter maintains the long hood and short rear deck proportions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are vertical slats visible on the front of the decanter, mimicking the original grille pattern?",
    "explanation": "The front of the decanter in Image B includes a grille-like structure that resembles the original Datsun 2000’s design. Upon close inspection, there are distinct vertical lines or slats forming the grille pattern, which are reflective and metallic, matching the overall chrome finish of the decanter. These vertical elements are consistent with the real car’s grille design, which featured horizontal and vertical bars. However, the dominant orientation here is vertical, and they are clearly visible as part of the decanter’s front face. Thus, the presence of vertical slats is confirmed, accurately mimicking the original grille style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the 'DATSUN' emblem positioned centrally on the front face of the decanter?",
    "explanation": "The 'DATSUN' text is located on the front of the decanter, just above the grille area. It is aligned along the horizontal centerline of the front face, directly between the two headlight areas. In automotive design, brand emblems are typically placed centrally for symmetry and brand visibility. The decanter follows this principle, placing the 'DATSUN' text in a central position on the hood area, even though it is part of the reflective surface. The symmetry of the headlights and bumper supports the conclusion that the text is centered. Therefore, the emblem is indeed positioned centrally.",
    "answer": "Yes"
