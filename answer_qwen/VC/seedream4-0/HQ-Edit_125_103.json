      "question": "Is there a large pink peony flower prominently displayed on the body of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in question is not a teapot but a golden cylindrical tea container. The floral design on this container includes a prominent pink peony-like flower, which is clearly visible and central to the decoration. This flower is large and positioned near the middle of the container's surface, making it a focal point. Based on visual analysis and common knowledge of traditional East Asian decorative art, such floral motifs often feature peonies as symbols of prosperity and beauty. Therefore, despite the object being a container rather than a teapot, the presence of a large pink peony is confirmed.",

      "question": "Is there a white clustered flower located next to the pink peony on the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a golden cylindrical tea container with a detailed floral motif. Adjacent to the large pink peony is a cluster of white flowers that resemble chrysanthemums or hydrangeas, commonly used in traditional Japanese designs. These white blooms are grouped together and positioned closely beside the pink peony, forming a balanced composition. This arrangement aligns with typical aesthetic principles in East Asian art, where contrasting colors and complementary floral elements enhance visual harmony. Thus, the presence of a white clustered flower next to the pink peony is evident.",

      "question": "Are there green leaves and stems extending from the base of the flowers on the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the floral design on the golden container in Image B, green leaves and slender stems are clearly visible, extending from the base of both the pink peony and the white clustered flower. These botanical elements are rendered with fine detail, consistent with traditional Japanese lacquerware or metalwork decoration. The inclusion of green foliage adds naturalism and balance to the composition, reflecting real plant structures. Given the artistic style and cultural context, such details are standard in representing flora realistically.",

      "question": "Do the floral elements include pink, white, green, and orange-red berry-like accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral motif on the golden container in Image B features a variety of colors: the main flowers are pink and white, supported by green leaves and stems. Additionally, small orange-red berry-like elements are present within the floral arrangement, particularly near the top of the bouquet. These berries add contrast and depth to the design, resembling holly or similar fruiting plants often included in seasonal decorations. The combination of these colors is typical in traditional East Asian art, where symbolic meanings are conveyed through color and form. Hence, all four mentioned elements—pink, white, green, and orange-red—are present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three distinct cups visible: one standing upright, one stacked beneath another, and one on top of the stack. All three contain a liquid that appears amber in color, consistent with brewed tea. However, only three cups are present in the scene, not four. Therefore, while the tea color is consistent across the cups, the count does not match the claim of 'four cups.' The statement about 'all four cups' is false due to the incorrect number of cups.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a teapot but a cylindrical tea container. However, the floral design is indeed centrally located on the body of this container, positioned horizontally around the midsection. This central placement is a common design choice in traditional tea storage vessels to draw attention to the artwork. The symmetry and positioning suggest intentional focus on the floral motif. Although the object is not a teapot, the term 'body' can be interpreted as the main surface area, where the floral elements are centered. Therefore, based on the visual layout and design principles, the answer is affirmative.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B is a golden tea container, not a teapot. Its surface has a smooth, reflective metallic finish with embossed or painted floral patterns, but no visible mesh or woven texture. A fine mesh or woven texture would imply a fabric-like or textured material, which is absent here. Instead, the surface appears polished and uniform, typical of lacquered or gilded metalwork. Therefore, the description of a fine mesh or woven texture does not apply to this object.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three cups visible: one upright cup filled with tea, and two smaller cups stacked beneath it. The topmost cup in the stack has a lid, suggesting it may be a lidded tea bowl. There is no fourth cup present in the scene. The total count is three, not four. This conclusion is based on direct visual observation and counting of distinct cup objects. The claim of 'exactly four cups' is therefore inaccurate.",
