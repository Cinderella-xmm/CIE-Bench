      "question": "Is the mechanical eyepatch with visible screws and metallic surface present on the central character’s right eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character is wearing a black hat and a trench coat, and has an eyepatch over his right eye. The eyepatch appears to be made of a dark material, possibly leather or fabric, and does not show any visible screws or metallic surface. Instead, it looks like a standard cloth or leather eyepatch commonly associated with detective or noir-style characters. There are no visual cues such as reflective surfaces, rivets, or mechanical components that would suggest a mechanical design. Therefore, based on the visual evidence, the eyepatch is not mechanical.",

      "question": "Is the central character holding an open book in both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character is holding an open book in his left hand. His right hand is holding a magnifying glass, not the book. The book is clearly visible in his left hand, but his right hand is occupied with another object. Therefore, the book is not being held in both hands.",

      "question": "Is there visible Chinese-style calligraphy on the cover of the book held by the central character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The book held by the central character in Image B has a red cover with what appears to be bloodstains and some text. However, the text is not clearly legible, and the style does not resemble traditional Chinese calligraphy. The characters appear to be more stylized or symbolic rather than actual script. Given the limited visibility and the abstract nature of the markings, there is no clear evidence of Chinese-style calligraphy. The presence of bloodstains may obscure any potential writing, making it difficult to identify specific scripts.",

      "question": "Does the central character have short, straight black hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character has short, dark hair that appears to be black. The hair is styled neatly and falls just above the ears, consistent with a classic detective or noir protagonist look. It is straight and lacks any curls or waves. Based on these visual characteristics, the description of short, straight black hair is accurate.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there four distinct supporting characters visible in the background, including one with white hair, one with purple hair, one with blue hair, and one with dark hair and red eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two supporting characters visible in the background—both wearing trench coats and hats, standing behind the central figure. They appear to be identical in appearance, suggesting they might be duplicates or part of a uniform group. There is no indication of white, purple, or blue hair among them. Additionally, none of the background characters display red eyes or any other distinguishing features mentioned in the question. The original image (Image A) contains multiple characters with varied hair colors and styles, but Image B simplifies the background to only two figures with no distinctive hair colors or eye traits. Therefore, the claim about four distinct characters with specific attributes is false in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the central character have a calm, neutral facial expression with a slightly downward gaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character's facial expression is composed and serious, with a slight furrow in the brow, indicating focus or contemplation. His gaze is directed slightly downward, toward the book he is holding, which aligns with the idea of a thoughtful or investigative demeanor. While not overtly emotional, the expression is best described as neutral and calm, fitting the noir detective theme. This matches the description of a calm, neutral expression with a downward gaze.",
