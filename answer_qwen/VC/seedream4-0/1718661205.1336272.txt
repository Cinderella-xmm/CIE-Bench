    "Question": "Q1: Is the woman’s facial profile, including the shape of her nose, jaw, and eyes, preserved in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "Image B is a photograph of a LEGO model display featuring a small LEGO ship with a minifigure on it. The original woman from Image A is not present in Image B. Instead, the scene includes a LEGO figure that does not resemble the woman at all—its face is blocky, stylized, and lacks human-like features such as detailed nose, jawline, or eyes. The LEGO figure has a simplified design typical of LEGO minifigures, with printed facial features rather than realistic anatomy. Therefore, the woman's facial profile cannot be preserved in Image B because she is entirely absent.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the woman’s hair light brown in color and styled in a braid?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure present is a LEGO minifigure with short, brown hair made of plastic, which is molded into a simple hairstyle typical of LEGO characters. It is not a braid but rather a solid piece of hair attached to the head. While the color appears to be a shade of brown, it is not light brown like the woman’s hair in Image A, nor is it styled in a braid. The minifigure’s hair is flat and symmetrical, lacking the texture and structure of a real braid. Thus, the hairstyle and color do not match the description of the woman’s hair.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the shirt and vest rendered in the original beige and olive-green colors, respectively?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO minifigure is wearing a white shirt and a brown vest (with a pattern resembling a life jacket). These are not the same as the beige shirt and olive-green tactical vest worn by the woman in Image A. LEGO uses simplified color schemes and often represents clothing with solid blocks of color. The vest in the minifigure is brown, not olive-green, and the shirt is white, not beige. Therefore, the color representation differs significantly from the original.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the woman’s hands positioned on a control mechanism in the same way as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO minifigure is standing on a ship, with its arms slightly outstretched and hands in a neutral pose, not gripping any control mechanism. There is no visible control panel or steering device that the minifigure is interacting with. In contrast, in Image A, the woman’s hands are clearly placed on a control mechanism, suggesting active operation. Since the LEGO figure is not engaging with any controls in the same manner, the hand positioning is not preserved.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the straps and buckles of the tactical vest visibly present and structurally intact?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO minifigure wears a vest that is made of a single piece of plastic with printed details resembling a vest. However, there are no visible straps or buckles; these elements are not physically present but only implied through printing. In contrast, the tactical vest in Image A has clearly defined straps and buckles made of fabric and metal, showing structural detail. LEGO models simplify such features due to manufacturing constraints. Thus, the straps and buckles are not structurally intact in the LEGO version.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the woman’s skin tone and facial expression (calm, focused) preserved?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO minifigure in Image B has a yellow plastic face with printed features, including eyes and a mouth, which convey a neutral or slightly smiling expression—not calm or focused like the woman in Image A. The skin tone is not realistic but rather a standard LEGO yellow used for figures, which is not representative of human skin tones. Additionally, the facial expression is generic and lacks the nuanced emotion seen in the original image. Therefore, neither the skin tone nor the facial expression is preserved.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the woman have blue-gray eyes?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the woman has eyes that appear to be blue-gray in color, based on the lighting and shading. However, in Image B, the LEGO minifigure has black printed eyes with white highlights, which are not blue-gray. LEGO figures use standardized eye designs that do not reflect natural eye color variations. Therefore, the eye color is not preserved in the LEGO model.",
    "answer": "No"
