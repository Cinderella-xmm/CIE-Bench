      "question": "Does the car retain the distinctive angular LED headlights and central grille intake characteristic of the McLaren 720S?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is displayed within a glass case as a model, positioned on a simulated road. The front view clearly shows the angular LED headlights, which are sharp and sleek—consistent with the design language of the McLaren 720S. Additionally, the central grille intake is visible beneath the hood, featuring a black mesh pattern typical of the model’s aerodynamic design. These features align with real-world specifications of the McLaren 720S, where the headlights are narrow and aggressive, and the central air intake is a signature element for cooling the engine. Even in this stylized diorama format, the model accurately replicates these key design elements.",

      "question": "Is the road still a curved two-lane highway with continuous double yellow lines running down its center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road is represented as a layered, translucent base within the display case. While it mimics the appearance of a curved two-lane highway, the 'road' is not a realistic roadway but rather an artistic interpretation made of resin or similar material. The double yellow lines are present, but they are simplified and lack continuity due to the segmented, wavy layers of the base. In contrast, Image A shows a realistic, smooth asphalt road with continuous double yellow lines that follow the curvature of the landscape. Therefore, although the concept of a two-lane road with yellow lines is preserved, the execution in Image B is stylized and does not maintain the realism or continuity seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the left-hand hillside still present with its reddish-brown slopes and scattered autumnal vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left-hand hillside is depicted as part of a background image printed or projected onto the side of the glass enclosure. It shows reddish-brown slopes and what appears to be autumnal vegetation, consistent with the original scene in Image A. However, this representation is flat and lacks depth, texture, and three-dimensionality. The vegetation is not physically present but rather a 2D rendering. In Image A, the hillside is fully rendered in 3D with realistic textures and lighting, creating a sense of volume and natural variation. Thus, while the visual theme is retained, the physical presence and realism of the hillside are significantly reduced in Image B.",

      "question": "Is there a concrete guardrail along the right side of the road, separating it from the ocean?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right side of the road is bounded by the transparent glass walls of the display case. There is no physical guardrail present; instead, the ocean and coastline are represented through a printed backdrop. The guardrail from Image A, which runs along the edge of the road and separates it from the cliffside, is absent in this version. The absence of a guardrail is consistent with the fact that this is a miniature diorama, where structural elements like guardrails would be impractical or omitted for aesthetic reasons. Therefore, while the idea of separation between road and sea is implied, the actual guardrail is not present.",

      "question": "Is the car positioned centrally on the right side of the road, facing forward toward the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is placed on the simulated road surface within the display case. It is centered horizontally within the frame and oriented forward, facing the direction of the horizon depicted in the background. However, the 'road' is not divided into lanes, so the concept of 'right side of the road' is abstract here. The car is aligned with the central axis of the display, suggesting a symmetrical composition. In Image A, the car is indeed positioned on the right side of the two-lane road, following traffic conventions (assuming right-hand driving), and is moving forward toward the horizon. In Image B, the positioning is more symbolic than literal, prioritizing visual balance over realism. Despite this, the car is effectively 'facing forward,' though not strictly on the right side of a lane.",

      "question": "Are rocky outcrops visible in the distant sea, with mist or spray rising near the shore?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes a printed image of the coastline, showing rocky outcrops in the sea and a hazy effect near the shore that suggests mist or spray. This visual detail is derived from the original scene in Image A, where such elements are clearly visible. Although the rocks and mist are not three-dimensional or physically present, their depiction is accurate and matches the original environment. The use of layered materials in the base also enhances the illusion of depth and atmospheric effects. Thus, while the representation is indirect, the key environmental features—rocky outcrops and coastal mist—are faithfully included in the diorama.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is shown from a front-three-quarter angle, and the windshield is clear enough to allow partial visibility into the interior. However, due to reflections, lighting, and the scale of the model, the details of the seats are not clearly discernible. The interior appears dark, and no distinct red racing seats with black accents can be confidently identified. In contrast, in Image A, the interior is highly detailed and visible, showing red seats with black stitching and sporty contours. In Image B, the focus is on the exterior and overall presentation, so interior details are sacrificed for aesthetic cohesion. Therefore, while the seats may exist in the model, they are not visibly confirmed in this image.",
