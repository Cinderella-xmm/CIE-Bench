      "question": "Is the mustache present with its original shape, including upward curls at the ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mustache is clearly visible and retains a distinct shape consistent with the style of the late 19th or early 20th century. The ends of the mustache are curled upward, which is characteristic of the 'handlebar' or ' imperial' mustache popular during that era. This curling is preserved in the stylized version, even though the image has been transformed into a pop-art aesthetic with bold outlines and color blocking. The artistic rendering does not distort the fundamental shape of the mustache; instead, it emphasizes it through contrast and line work. Therefore, based on visual cues and historical context of facial hair styles, the mustache maintains its original form, including the upward curls.",

      "question": "Are both eyes visible and positioned symmetrically with the bridge of the nose aligned centrally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both eyes are clearly visible and appear to be symmetrically placed relative to the face's central axis. The bridge of the nose is centered between the eyes, and there is no indication of asymmetry or distortion in the facial structure. Although the image uses a graphic, pop-art style with halftone patterns and bold lines, the facial features remain proportionally balanced. The symmetry is maintained despite the stylization, as the artist has preserved the natural alignment of the eyes and nose. Comparing this to typical portrait conventions, especially from historical photographs (as seen in Image A), the symmetry appears consistent. Thus, the facial alignment remains accurate.",

      "question": "Is the hairline clearly defined with a receding pattern at the temples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hairline is distinctly outlined using bold black lines, typical of pop-art illustrations. The hairline shows a clear receding pattern at the temples, forming a V-shape that is common in men of certain ages, particularly those from the late 1800s to early 1900s. This receding hairline is emphasized by the high-contrast rendering and sharp edges, making it highly visible. While the artistic style exaggerates contours, it accurately reflects the original hairline pattern seen in Image A. The use of clean lines and shading supports the interpretation that the receding pattern is intentional and preserved. Hence, the hairline is clearly defined and shows a receding pattern.",

      "question": "Is the bow tie located at the center of the neck, forming a symmetrical knot beneath the collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow tie is positioned directly at the center of the neck, just below the collar. The knot is rendered symmetrically, with equal loops on either side and a straight central band. Despite the vibrant, multicolored design of the bow tie, which includes geometric patterns and bright hues, its placement and shape adhere to standard formal wear conventions. The symmetry is maintained through careful alignment with the vertical axis of the face and torso. In comparison to Image A, where the bow tie is also centered and symmetrical, the edited version preserves this detail while enhancing it with artistic flair. Therefore, the bow tie is correctly placed and shaped.",

      "question": "Is the text \"S. W. Kramer.\" present below the image in the same font and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'S. W. Kramer.' is indeed present below the portrait. It is positioned in the same location as in Image A—centered beneath the image—and uses the same serif font style. The lettering is clear and legible, with consistent spacing and capitalization. Although the overall image has been digitally altered with pop-art effects, the text has not been modified in terms of content, font, or placement. This suggests that the caption was retained intentionally for identification purposes. The consistency in typography and positioning indicates that the original labeling has been preserved without alteration.",

      "question": "Is the subject’s head turned slightly to the left, with the body facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's head is turned slightly toward the viewer's left, which is consistent with the pose in Image A. The angle of the face, the direction of the gaze, and the tilt of the head all indicate a slight leftward turn. However, the shoulders and upper body appear to be oriented directly forward, suggesting that the torso is facing the camera while the head is angled. This pose is typical in formal portraits of the period, designed to convey dignity and presence. The pop-art rendering does not alter this spatial relationship; instead, it preserves the original composition. Therefore, the head is turned slightly to the left, and the body faces forward.",

      "question": "Is the image framed within a rectangular border with visible margins on all sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portrait is enclosed within a clear rectangular border, similar to the one in Image A. The border is thin but distinct, framing the entire image. Additionally, there are visible margins on all four sides—top, bottom, left, and right—between the border and the edge of the page. These margins provide space for the text 'S. W. Kramer.' to be placed below the image and allow for a balanced layout. The presence of these margins is consistent with traditional print formats, especially in historical documents or yearbooks. The artistic transformation does not eliminate or distort the frame or margins; they remain intact. Thus, the image is properly framed with visible margins.",
