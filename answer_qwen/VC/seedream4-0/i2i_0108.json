      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is clearly wearing a helmet that features a prominent 'A' logo on the forehead area. This is consistent with Captain America's iconic design, where the 'A' stands for 'America'. The helmet also includes a black eye mask and a chin strap, which are standard components of his headgear. The visual details such as the shape, color (blue with silver accents), and placement of the 'A' confirm that it matches the original design. There is no indication of any alteration or removal of this element in the edited image. Therefore, based on the visual cues and knowledge of Captain America's appearance, the helmet with the 'A' logo is retained.",

      "question": "Is the shield retained with its concentric red, white, and blue rings and central metallic star?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is holding a circular shield that displays the classic design of Captain America’s shield: concentric rings of red, white, and blue, with a central metallic star. The colors are vivid and accurately arranged—red outer ring, white middle ring, blue inner circle, and a silver star at the center. This design is iconic and well-known from both comic books and film adaptations. The shield appears to be three-dimensional and reflective, indicating high-quality rendering. There is no distortion or omission of these elements. Thus, the shield retains its signature appearance.",

      "question": "Has the character's costume retained the red, white, and blue color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The costume in Image B features a dominant blue base with red and white accents. The chest plate has a large silver star, flanked by red panels and white trim, which aligns with Captain America’s traditional color palette. The sleeves include red stripes, and the overall suit maintains the patriotic theme. Even though the lighting and digital environment may affect color perception slightly, the primary colors remain consistent with the original design. Comparing this to known depictions of Captain America, especially from recent films, the color scheme is faithfully preserved. Therefore, the costume retains the red, white, and blue color scheme.",

      "question": "Is the star emblem on the character’s chest still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s chest prominently displays a large, five-pointed metallic star, which is a defining feature of Captain America’s uniform. The star is centrally located on the chest plate and is rendered with a silver finish, matching the style seen in official Marvel media. It is not obscured or altered in any way. This emblem is a key symbol of the character’s identity and patriotism. Given its clear visibility and correct positioning, the star emblem remains intact.",

      "question": "Does the character maintain an upright and assertive posture indicating readiness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted standing with a strong, forward-facing stance. His left hand is clenched into a fist near his chest, while his right arm holds the shield in a defensive position. This posture conveys alertness and preparedness for action. The body language is confident and dynamic, typical of a hero ready to engage. Although the character appears to be emerging from a screen, the pose itself is assertive and heroic. This contrasts with passive or relaxed postures and aligns with Captain America’s portrayal as a leader and warrior. Therefore, the character maintains an upright and assertive posture indicating readiness.",
