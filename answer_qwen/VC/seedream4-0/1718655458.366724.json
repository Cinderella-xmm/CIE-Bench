      "question": "Is the flowing brown and gray marbled pattern visible on the surfaces of the LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the LEGO bricks are clearly visible with a surface texture that mimics natural marble. The pattern includes flowing veins in warm brown and gray tones that traverse across the white base of the bricks. These veins are not uniformly distributed but follow organic, wavy paths consistent with natural stone patterns. The visual cues—such as the irregularity and continuity of the lines—indicate that the marbled effect is intentionally applied to simulate real marble. This observation is supported by world knowledge that marble is characterized by such flowing, non-repeating veining patterns. Therefore, the presence of both brown and gray marbling is evident.",

      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks rendered with a white base color accented by warm brown and gray marbling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary color of the LEGO bricks is white, which serves as the background for the marbled design. Overlaid on this white base are distinct veins in warm brown and gray hues. These colors appear as accent patterns that resemble natural marble, creating a contrast against the white surface. This aligns with common design practices where materials like marble are represented using a light base (often white) with darker, contrasting veins. The visual evidence confirms that the bricks are not solid-colored but feature these accents, indicating a deliberate aesthetic choice to emulate marble. Thus, the description matches the observed appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the marbled veins follow an organic, irregular flow rather than a geometric or repetitive pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marbled veins on the LEGO bricks in Image B exhibit a natural, non-uniform flow. They curve, branch, and vary in thickness in ways that mimic the randomness found in natural stone. There is no indication of symmetry, repetition, or alignment with geometric shapes. This contrasts sharply with artificial or manufactured patterns that often display regularity. World knowledge tells us that true marble has such organic, unpredictable veining due to mineral deposits over time. The absence of any repeating motifs or structured lines supports the conclusion that the pattern is designed to be organically irregular.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both warm brown and gray veins present together in the marbled pattern of the LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A close inspection of Image B reveals that multiple LEGO bricks display both warm brown and gray veins within their marbled patterns. These colors coexist on the same brick surfaces, sometimes interweaving or appearing in adjacent regions. For example, some bricks show brown veins near the edges while gray ones run through the center. This dual presence suggests a layered or blended application of the marbling effect. From a design perspective, combining multiple vein colors enhances realism, as natural marble often contains various mineral streaks. The visual evidence supports the simultaneous presence of both colors.",

      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks visually appear to be made of a marble-like material based on their surface pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface pattern of the LEGO bricks in Image B strongly resembles natural marble. The combination of a white base with flowing, irregular veins in brown and gray is characteristic of marble finishes commonly seen in architecture and decor. While the bricks retain their typical LEGO structure (with studs and interlocking features), the surface texture is stylized to mimic polished stone. This visual simulation leverages world knowledge about how marble appears—smooth, reflective, and veined—suggesting that the intended impression is one of a marble-like material. Although they are plastic, the design choices make them appear as if crafted from marble.",
