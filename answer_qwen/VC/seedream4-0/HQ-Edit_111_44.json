      "question": "Is the elderly woman’s face clearly visible with deep wrinkles and dark skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly woman is positioned centrally and facing slightly to the left, allowing a clear view of her facial features. Her skin appears deeply wrinkled, particularly around the eyes, forehead, and mouth, which is consistent with advanced age. The texture of her skin is detailed, showing natural creases and pigmentation typical of aged dark skin. The lighting in the image enhances these textures, making them prominent. This observation aligns with common visual cues used to depict aging and ethnic diversity in realistic portrayals. There are no obstructions or blurring effects on her face, confirming that it is clearly visible.",

      "question": "Is the central figure standing upright with her hands clasped in front of her?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elderly woman in Image B is standing upright, with her posture straight and balanced. Her hands are positioned in front of her body, holding a small wooden bowl. While her hands are not fully clasped together in a prayer-like gesture, they are held close together, suggesting a composed and dignified stance. Given the context of a market scene, this posture is consistent with someone who is engaged in trade or observation. The positioning of her arms and hands indicates a deliberate and respectful demeanor, even if not strictly 'clasped' in the traditional sense. However, based on the precise wording of the question, her hands are not tightly clasped but rather gently holding an object.",

      "question": "Is there a large tanned fabric canopy stretched overhead, providing shade over the market?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large, light-brown fabric canopy is clearly visible stretching across the top of the market alley. It is suspended between buildings and covers a significant portion of the street, casting shadows below. This type of canopy is commonly used in traditional markets in arid regions to provide shade from the sun. The material appears to be woven or canvas-like, consistent with tanned fabric. Its presence is functional and visually dominant, indicating its role in protecting vendors and shoppers from direct sunlight. This feature is both structurally and culturally plausible in such settings.",

      "question": "Are the market goods placed in woven baskets on a stone-paved ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The market scene in Image B shows various goods—such as fruits, vegetables, grains, and spices—arranged in round, shallow containers. These containers appear to be made of woven materials, likely reed or straw, consistent with traditional market baskets. The ground beneath them is composed of irregularly shaped stones, forming a paved surface typical of historic market alleys. The combination of woven baskets and stone pavement is characteristic of traditional Middle Eastern or North African markets. The texture and pattern of the ground confirm it is stone-paved, and the baskets are uniformly crafted, supporting their identification as woven.",

      "question": "Are there multiple stacked bangles visible on both of the woman’s arms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly woman’s arms are adorned with numerous bracelets. On her right arm (viewer's left), several wide, metallic bangles are stacked closely together, forming a thick cuff-like appearance. On her left arm (viewer's right), similar bangles are present, though fewer in number and slightly more spaced out. These bangles are consistent with traditional jewelry styles worn by women in certain African or Middle Eastern cultures. Their placement and design suggest they are intentionally layered for cultural or aesthetic significance. Therefore, multiple stacked bangles are visible on both arms.",

      "question": "Are there mud-brick buildings with hanging textiles lining both sides of the market alley?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buildings flanking the market alley in Image B have a warm, earthy tone and a rough, textured surface, consistent with mud-brick construction. This architectural style is common in arid regions such as parts of North Africa or the Middle East. Along the walls, colorful textiles—such as scarves, fabrics, and rugs—are hung vertically, adding vibrancy to the scene. These textiles are displayed for sale, which is typical in traditional markets. The combination of mud-brick architecture and hanging textiles aligns with cultural and environmental context, reinforcing the authenticity of the setting.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly woman is holding a small, shallow bowl made of wood. The bowl has a smooth, polished surface and a rounded shape, consistent with handcrafted wooden utensils used in traditional markets. Her hands are positioned around it, suggesting she is either displaying it or using it for a transaction. The size and form of the bowl are appropriate for holding small quantities of spices, grains, or other goods. This detail is consistent with market practices where vendors use such bowls for measuring or selling items.",
