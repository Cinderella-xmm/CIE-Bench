    "Question": "Q1: Is the skull face with grinning teeth and hollow eyes located on the rear fender of the motorcycle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is a LEGO-style model, not a real motorcycle. The design elements are replicated in block form. Observing the rear fender area, there is no visible skull face with grinning teeth and hollow eyes. Instead, the rear section features blue angular blocks and black components typical of LEGO construction, but no facial features or decals resembling a skull. This contrasts with common motorcycle customizations where such graphics are often placed on the rear fender for visual impact. Therefore, based on the visual evidence in Image B, the skull face is not present on the rear fender.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a skull face with grinning teeth and hollow eyes positioned on the front headlight cowl?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front headlight cowl of the LEGO motorcycle is constructed from blue and black blocks. There is no depiction of a skull face with grinning teeth and hollow eyes on this part. Instead, the front fairing has a sleek, angular design consistent with LEGO's modular building style, but lacks any facial features. In contrast, in Image A (the original), the front headlight cowl does feature a stylized skull graphic. However, since Image B is a LEGO recreation, it simplifies complex designs into block forms, omitting detailed graphics like the skull. Thus, the skull face is absent in the LEGO version.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the blue angular stripes present along the fuel tank, side panels, and front fairing in the same geometric configuration as in the original?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO motorcycle replicates the overall aesthetic of the original design from Image A, including the use of blue angular stripes. These stripes are applied to the fuel tank, side panels, and front fairing using blue LEGO bricks arranged in sharp, angular patterns that closely mimic the dynamic lines seen in the original decal design. While the medium differs—LEGO blocks versus vinyl stickers—the geometric configuration remains consistent, preserving the intended visual flow and symmetry. Therefore, despite the material difference, the layout and shape of the stripes are faithfully reproduced.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the “V-SDI” and “VFORCE3” decal visible on the lower side panel near the foot peg area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lower side panel near the foot peg area is constructed from black and blue LEGO bricks. Upon close inspection, small printed stickers or labels are visible on the side panel, including text such as 'V-SDI' and 'VFORCE3', which are characteristic of Yamaha engine technology branding. These decals are positioned in the same relative location as they would be on a real motorcycle, just below the seat and adjacent to the foot peg area. Although the scale and resolution are reduced due to the LEGO format, the presence and placement of these decals match the original design intent. Hence, they are indeed visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the motorcycle shown in a side profile view facing toward the right side of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is displayed inside a transparent display case. It is oriented so that its left side is visible to the viewer, meaning it is facing toward the right side of the image. This is confirmed by the positioning of the handlebars, front wheel, and headlight, all pointing to the right. The side profile view is clearly maintained, allowing full visibility of the bike’s lateral design, including the exhaust, seat, and bodywork. This orientation is consistent with standard product photography for showcasing vehicle details. Therefore, the motorcycle is indeed shown in a side profile view facing right.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the exhaust pipe located beneath the seat and curving downward toward the rear wheel?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the exhaust system of the LEGO motorcycle is constructed from gray and silver-colored pieces. It is positioned beneath the seat and extends backward, curving downward toward the rear wheel. This matches the typical design of many sporty motorcycles, where the exhaust runs under the rider's seat and exits near the rear tire. The LEGO model accurately replicates this configuration using curved and straight pieces to simulate the real-world exhaust path. Thus, the exhaust pipe is correctly placed and shaped as described.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the seat have a smooth, slightly curved surface with a raised backrest?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the seat of the LEGO motorcycle is made of black blocks stacked in a way that creates a slightly curved surface. However, it lacks the smooth finish seen in real motorcycles and instead has a blocky, segmented texture due to the LEGO construction. Additionally, there is no distinct raised backrest; the rear portion of the seat is flat and integrated into the tail section without elevation. In contrast, real motorcycles often have ergonomically designed seats with slight curvature and backrests for comfort. Since the LEGO model prioritizes structural integrity over fine detail, the seat does not possess a smooth, slightly curved surface with a raised backrest.",
    "answer": "No"
