      "question": "Is the Mustang logo visible and intact on the grille in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top view of the car shows the front grille clearly, where the iconic Mustang horse logo is centered and fully visible. In both side views, although the grille is not directly facing the viewer, the logo's position can be inferred from the front-facing perspective. The front view (top left) clearly displays the logo on the grille, while the top-down view (right) also reveals the logo positioned centrally on the hood, just above the grille. Given that the Mustang logo is a signature design element placed prominently on the grille and often replicated on the hood, its presence and integrity across views are consistent with real-world vehicle design. There are no visual distortions or missing elements in any of the views. Therefore, based on the visual cues and world knowledge of Mustang branding, the logo is visible and intact in all views.",

      "question": "Does the side view of the car include the GT badge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both side views of the car show the driver’s side door area. On the rear quarter panel of the car, near the back of the door, there is a 'GT' badge visible. This placement aligns with standard Ford Mustang GT models, where the GT badge is typically located on the front fender or rear quarter panel to denote the model variant. The badge is clearly visible in both side views, indicating consistency in the depiction. Based on world knowledge of Mustang trim levels and badge placement, the GT badge should be present on this model, and it is indeed shown correctly in the image.",

      "question": "Are the wheels depicted with the same black multi-spoke design in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all three views—front, rear, and top—show the wheels of the Mustang. In the front and rear side views, the wheels feature a black multi-spoke design, which is characteristic of high-performance Mustang variants like the GT. The top-down view confirms that both front and rear wheels have the same design, including the number of spokes and overall shape. There are no discrepancies in wheel design between the views. This consistency is expected in professional automotive renderings, where symmetry and uniformity are maintained. Thus, based on visual inspection and knowledge of typical Mustang wheel designs, the wheels are consistently depicted with the same black multi-spoke design in all views.",

      "question": "Is the car consistently depicted in black with its original sleek shape across all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the Mustang from three distinct angles: front-side, rear-side, and top-down. In each view, the car maintains a consistent glossy black finish, which reflects light uniformly, suggesting a single paint color without variations. The body lines, curves, and proportions—such as the long hood, short deck, and sculpted fenders—are preserved across all views, matching the known design language of the modern Ford Mustang. The silhouette remains sleek and aerodynamic, with no visible distortions or deformations. The top-down view further confirms the symmetrical and balanced shape of the car. Based on world knowledge of Mustang design and visual consistency in automotive illustrations, the car is accurately and consistently depicted in black with its original sleek shape in all views.",

      "question": "Do the headlights and exhaust outlets appear correctly placed and designed in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front-side view clearly shows the headlights positioned at the front corners of the car, with a sharp, angular design typical of recent Mustang models. The LED daytime running lights are visible, and their layout matches the actual design. In the rear-side view, dual exhaust outlets are visible on the lower right side of the bumper, which is consistent with the GT model's performance-oriented design. The top-down view does not show the exhaust outlets directly but supports the correct placement by showing the rear bumper's structure. The headlights are only visible in the front-facing views, but their positioning is accurate. There are no anomalies in their shape or location. Based on world knowledge of Mustang styling and engineering, the headlights and exhaust outlets are correctly placed and designed in all views.",
