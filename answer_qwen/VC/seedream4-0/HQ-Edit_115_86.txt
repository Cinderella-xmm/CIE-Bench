    "Question": "Q1: Are the pointe shoes visible and correctly positioned on the ballerina’s feet, with ribbons wrapped around the ankles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina is depicted in a stylized, illustrated form. Her feet are clearly shown wearing pointe shoes, which are characteristic of classical ballet. The shoes are positioned en pointe, with the toes bearing the weight, as expected in ballet technique. The ribbons of the pointe shoes are visibly wrapped around her ankles and tied neatly, consistent with standard ballet footwear presentation. This depiction aligns with real-world ballet practices where ribbons secure the shoes to the dancer’s feet for stability. The illustration accurately captures this detail despite its artistic style.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the ballerina wearing a tutu with a layered, flared skirt extending from the waist?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina is wearing a tutu that is visually expansive and voluminous. The skirt consists of multiple layers of fabric, creating a full, flared silhouette that extends outward from the waist. This design is typical of classical ballet tutus, especially those worn in performances like 'The Nutcracker' or 'Sleeping Beauty'. The layered construction gives the impression of movement and grace, which is essential in ballet attire. The illustration emphasizes the texture and volume through shading and layering, reinforcing the perception of a traditional, flared tutu.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the ballerina have her hair styled in a tight bun at the back of her head with straight bangs across her forehead?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina's hairstyle is clearly visible. Her dark hair is pulled back into a neat, tight bun located at the back of her head, which is a common and practical hairstyle for ballet dancers to keep hair out of their face during performance. Additionally, she has straight bangs that fall evenly across her forehead. This combination of a bun and bangs is both aesthetically pleasing and functional in dance contexts, and it matches the visual representation in the image. The style is consistent with typical ballet aesthetics.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the ballerina standing en pointe with one leg slightly behind and bent, and the other leg supporting her weight in a balanced position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina is depicted in a classic ballet pose. She is standing en pointe, meaning her weight is supported on the tips of her toes, which is evident from the positioning of her feet. One leg (the right) is extended slightly behind her and bent at the knee, while the other (the left) is fully extended and supporting her body weight. This posture reflects a balanced and graceful stance commonly seen in ballet, such as in an arabesque or similar position. The illustration captures the alignment and balance required in such a pose, even though it is stylized.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the ballerina standing on a wooden floor composed of horizontal planks with visible grain and warm brown tones?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floor beneath the ballerina is rendered with horizontal wooden planks. The texture and pattern suggest wood grain, and the color palette includes warm brown tones, consistent with typical hardwood floors found in dance studios or performance stages. While the rendering is illustrative rather than photorealistic, the visual cues—such as the direction of the planks, the subtle variations in tone, and the shadowing under the ballerina—support the interpretation that it is a wooden floor. This type of flooring is common in ballet settings due to its durability and slip resistance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

This pose conveys elegance and focus, typical of ballet movements where the dancer maintains an elongated line and expressive posture. The angle of her neck and the orientation of her face confirm that her head is turned to the right, aligning with the overall composition of the image. This positioning enhances the sense of grace and uplifted emotion often associated with ballet performances.",

These embellishments are subtle but noticeable, adding a touch of sparkle without overwhelming the design. Such details are common in ballet costumes to enhance visual appeal during performances. The overall color scheme and decoration are consistent with traditional ballet attire.",
