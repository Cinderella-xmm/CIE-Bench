      "question": "Is the chisel with a long straight steel shaft and wooden handle still present in the same shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chisel with a long straight steel shaft and wooden handle is visible on the pegboard. By examining its position relative to surrounding tools (such as the gouge and other chisels), it appears to be in the same location as in the original image. The tool's shape—long steel blade and wooden handle—is consistent with typical woodworking chisels. Comparing this to Image A, the chisel’s orientation and placement remain unchanged, indicating no editing or displacement. This conclusion is based on visual alignment with adjacent tools and consistent proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the gouge with a curved cutting edge and oval wooden handle still present in the same shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gouge with a curved cutting edge and oval wooden handle is located among the hanging tools on the pegboard. Its shape and position are consistent with those seen in Image A. The curved blade and oval handle are clearly distinguishable, and its placement between two other tools remains unaltered. No distortion or repositioning is evident when comparing both images. Therefore, the gouge retains its original form and location.",

      "question": "Does the hammer retain its original shape, including the clawed end and black metal head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hammer in Image B has a clearly defined clawed end and a black metal head, consistent with standard claw hammers used in woodworking. The wooden handle shows natural grain, and the metal head includes a flat striking surface and a claw for pulling nails. Comparing it to Image A, there are no visible changes in shape, size, or material. The hammer’s design remains intact, suggesting no modification was made to its structure.",

      "question": "Are the wood shavings still in their original spiral curled form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wood shavings scattered across the workbench maintain their spiral curled form, which is characteristic of shavings produced by hand planes or chisels. These curls are evenly distributed and resemble real-world wood shavings. There is no indication of flattening, distortion, or digital manipulation that would alter their shape. When compared to Image A, the curls appear identical in form and distribution, confirming they have not been modified.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The workbench in Image B displays clear signs of natural wood grain, scratches, and wear patterns typical of a well-used woodworking bench. These textures are consistent with real wood surfaces subjected to frequent use. The lighting highlights these details, emphasizing authenticity. Compared to Image A, the grain and wear marks are preserved without smoothing or enhancement, indicating the original texture remains intact.",

      "question": "Is the perforated pegboard with evenly spaced holes still present in the same layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pegboard in Image B features a grid of evenly spaced holes, consistent with standard workshop pegboards. The pattern and spacing match those in Image A. Tools are mounted in the same positions relative to the holes, confirming the layout has not changed. The background structure of the pegboard remains consistent, with no evidence of rearrangement or alteration.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the hammer positioned diagonally across the workbench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer lies diagonally across the workbench, extending from the lower-left to the upper-right portion of the frame. This diagonal positioning is consistent with how it appears in Image A. The angle and placement suggest intentional composition to emphasize the tool's presence. There is no shift in orientation, so the diagonal arrangement remains unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the right side of the workbench in Image B, a small wooden box filled with wood shavings is visible. Its position and contents match those in Image A. The box appears slightly worn, consistent with workshop use, and is placed near the edge of the bench. No changes in location, size, or contents are observed, indicating it remains in its original state.",
