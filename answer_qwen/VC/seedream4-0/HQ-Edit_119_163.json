      "question": "Are the embossed dragons with detailed scales, claws, and flowing bodies clearly visible on the body of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central motif on the cylindrical body of the object is a highly detailed dragon design. The dragon is depicted in raised relief, with visible scales along its body, defined claws, and a sinuous, flowing form that wraps around the surface. These features are consistent with traditional East Asian dragon iconography, where such details are emphasized for symbolic and aesthetic purposes. The lighting highlights the depth and texture of the embossing, making the scales and claws distinctly recognizable. Based on visual cues and common artistic conventions for ornamental metalwork, the level of detail confirms that the dragon is clearly visible with all mentioned attributes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the surface of the object textured with raised relief patterns, particularly around the dragon motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the object in Image B shows clear signs of raised relief work, especially around the dragon motif. The dragon's body, wings, and surrounding cloud-like patterns are elevated above the base surface, creating shadows and depth due to the lighting. This technique is typical in decorative metalwork, where embossing adds dimensionality and visual interest. The contrast between the shiny metallic background and the textured relief further emphasizes the three-dimensional quality of the design. Therefore, the presence of raised relief patterns is evident, particularly in the dragon area.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a distinct spout extending from the side of the object, shaped like a dragon's head with an open mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spout of the object in Image B extends from the side and is indeed designed to resemble a dragon's head. It has a pointed snout, visible eye detail, and an open mouth at the tip, which is characteristic of stylized dragon heads used in traditional teapots or ceremonial vessels. The curvature and shape of the spout align with the overall dragon theme, reinforcing the motif seen on the body. This design choice is common in cultural artifacts meant to symbolize power and auspiciousness. Thus, the spout matches the description of a dragonâ€™s head with an open mouth.",

      "question": "Does the object retain a silver-colored, highly reflective metallic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B exhibits a bright, silvery appearance with strong reflections visible on its surface, indicating a polished metallic finish. Light reflects off the curved surfaces, including the body, lid, and spout, creating sharp highlights and mirror-like qualities. This high reflectivity is consistent with materials like stainless steel or polished silver, commonly used in premium tea-related products. The uniformity of the sheen across the entire object supports the conclusion that it has a silver-colored, highly reflective surface.",

      "question": "Is the object positioned upright on a flat surface, such as a wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is standing vertically on a horizontal surface composed of parallel wooden planks, consistent with a wooden table or deck. The base of the object is fully in contact with the surface, and there is no tilt or imbalance visible. The shadow beneath the object is aligned directly below it, confirming its upright placement. The wood grain and color suggest outdoor or rustic furniture, but the flatness and stability of the surface are clear. Therefore, the object is indeed positioned upright on a flat surface.",
