      "question": "Is the number \"18\" clearly visible on the back of the player's jersey?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player is depicted as a stylized, cartoon-like character inside a glowing, oval-shaped portal. The character is wearing a purple jersey, and the number '18' is visible on the back of the jersey in white. Although the image is not photorealistic and has an animated style, the number '18' is clearly displayed and legible on the back of the jersey. This conclusion is drawn from direct visual inspection of the character’s attire within the portal.",

      "question": "Is the number \"18\" visible on the front left side of the player's jersey?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown from a frontal perspective inside the portal, but the number '18' is not visible on the front left side of the jersey. In typical baseball uniforms, numbers are usually placed on the back, and sometimes smaller numbers appear on the front, but in this case, no number is visible on the front left side. The front of the jersey appears plain without any visible numbering. This assessment is based on the visual content of the character’s uniform in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player character is wearing a purple jersey and a purple cap. However, the cap does not have a black brim; instead, it appears to be uniformly purple with no visible contrast or black trim. This observation is made by analyzing the coloration and design of the cap in the stylized animation. While the overall color scheme matches the original (purple), the brim detail differs from what might be expected in a realistic depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player character's hands are not covered with batting gloves. Instead, they are bare, which is inconsistent with standard baseball equipment. This is evident from the visual representation of the character's hands, which show no gloves. In real baseball, players wear gloves for grip and protection, but in this stylized version, the gloves are omitted for aesthetic or artistic reasons.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player character is not holding a baseball bat at all. The character is standing on a pitcher's mound inside the portal, and there is no bat present in their hands. This is a significant deviation from the original image where the player is actively swinging a bat. The absence of a bat in Image B is clear from visual inspection, indicating that the character is not engaged in a batting action.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a white baseball with red stitching visible near the bottom of the portal, resting on the grass. However, it is not in motion or approaching a bat, as there is no bat present. The ball is stationary and located outside the immediate action area. Therefore, while the baseball is present, it is not in the air or approaching a bat, which is required for the condition to be true.",

      "question": "Is the player in a crouched batting stance with knees bent and torso twisted forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player character is standing upright on the pitcher's mound, not in a crouched batting stance. The knees are slightly bent, but the torso is not twisted forward in a batting posture. Instead, the character appears to be in a neutral or walking pose, likely part of an animated sequence. This contrasts with the dynamic batting stance seen in Image A. The lack of a forward twist and proper batting alignment confirms that the character is not in a batting stance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player character is not holding a bat at all, so neither hand is gripping a bat near the handle. This is directly observable from the image, where the character’s hands are free and not interacting with any equipment. Since there is no bat present, the question of hand placement on the bat is irrelevant. This is a clear departure from the original image where both hands are gripping the bat.",
