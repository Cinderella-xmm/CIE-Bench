      "question": "Is the white-framed window visible on the front face of the transformed structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed structure appears to be a fantastical creature with a house-like roof integrated into its back. The front face of this structure is now part of a larger, ethereal body composed of icy and luminous elements. However, upon close inspection, the original white-framed window from the chalet is still present and clearly visible on the front-facing side of the triangular roof section. This suggests that despite the transformation, key architectural features like the window have been preserved. The window maintains its position and appearance, consistent with the original design of the chalet, indicating it was intentionally retained during the transformation.",

      "question": "Is the small red structure located to the left of the main chalet still present in the transformed scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, there is a small red structure (likely a shed or outbuilding) positioned to the left of the main chalet. In Image B, this structure is no longer visible. The entire scene has been transformed, with the chalet now replaced by a mythical creature. The area where the small red structure was located appears to be occupied by natural terrain—rocks, moss, and water—without any trace of the red building. Given that the transformation focuses on the central chalet and alters the surrounding environment significantly, the absence of the small red structure is consistent with a major reimagining of the landscape. Therefore, it can be concluded that the structure is no longer present.",

      "question": "Does the waterway flow from the bottom-right corner toward the center-left of the image, maintaining its original course?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the waterway flows from the lower right toward the center-left, forming a meandering path across the rocky terrain. In Image B, the waterway remains largely unchanged in its overall direction and layout. It continues to originate near the bottom-right and moves toward the center-left, following the same general topography. Although the presence of the fantastical creature introduces new visual elements, the stream's path appears unaltered, suggesting that the transformation did not disrupt the natural flow of the water. This continuity supports the idea that the waterway maintains its original course.",

      "question": "Is the large patch of snow located directly in front of the chalet still visible and positioned in the same place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, there is a noticeable patch of snow situated directly in front of the chalet, lying between the building and the stream. In Image B, this specific snow patch is no longer visible. Instead, the area has been transformed into part of the creature’s base, with icy textures and glowing elements replacing the snow. While snow patches remain in other parts of the background, the one directly in front of the chalet has been removed or integrated into the new fantasy element. Thus, the original positioning and visibility of this snow patch are lost in the transformation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, moss-covered rocks line the edges of the stream, contributing to the natural, rugged terrain. In Image B, these features are still present. The stream banks continue to display rocks covered in green moss, especially visible in the foreground and along the sides of the waterway. Even though the central focus has shifted to the fantastical creature, the surrounding environment retains many of its original natural elements. The mossy rocks appear consistent with the original scene, suggesting that they were preserved during the transformation process.",

      "question": "Is the transformed structure located in the mid-ground, slightly to the right of the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed structure—a creature with a house-shaped head—is positioned centrally but slightly to the right of the image's vertical center. It stands in the mid-ground, between the foreground stream and the distant mountains. Its placement is balanced within the composition, drawing attention while remaining within the natural depth of the scene. This positioning aligns with the typical artistic framing used to emphasize a central subject, and it matches the spatial relationship observed in the original image, where the chalet was similarly centered. Therefore, the transformed structure occupies the mid-ground and is slightly right of center.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the mountain peaks are partially obscured by mist and feature snow patches on their slopes. In Image B, the background remains largely unchanged. The mountains are still visible, with their upper portions shrouded in mist and snow remnants present on the slopes. Despite the fantastical transformation in the foreground, the distant landscape appears untouched, preserving the atmospheric conditions and geographical features of the original scene. This consistency suggests that the background was intentionally left intact to maintain environmental context.",
