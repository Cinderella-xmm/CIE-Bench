    "Question": "Q1: Are the irises of the eyes still blue?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's eyes are clearly visible, and the irises appear to be a shade of blue. This is consistent with typical human eye coloration and matches the visual cues observed in the image. The lighting is neutral and even, allowing for accurate color perception without significant distortion or shadowing. There is no indication of any artificial coloring or filtering that would alter the natural appearance of the irises. Based on the visual evidence and common knowledge about human anatomy and photography, the irises retain their blue hue.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the facial structure, including the nose, jawline, and cheekbones, unchanged?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial structure appears consistent with that of a human female, featuring a well-defined nose, prominent cheekbones, and a clear jawline. These features are proportionate and symmetrical, suggesting a natural and unaltered face. Comparing this to Image A, which shows the same individual with similar facial features, there is no noticeable difference in the shape or proportions of the nose, jawline, or cheekbones. The consistency across both images indicates that the facial structure has not been modified. This conclusion is supported by the continuity in facial geometry and the absence of any digital distortions or alterations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the subject positioned with a slight leftward turn of the body while facing forward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is standing upright with her body oriented slightly toward the left side of the frame. However, her head is turned to face directly forward, indicating that while the torso is angled, the face is aligned with the viewer. This positioning suggests a slight leftward turn of the body but not the head. In contrast, Image A shows the subject with her body more centered and facing forward, with minimal lateral tilt. Therefore, the body orientation in Image B differs from Image A, showing a more pronounced leftward turn. This analysis is based on the relative angles of the shoulders and hips compared to the direction of the face.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are both arms positioned naturally at the sides of the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both arms are hanging down along the sides of the body, with the hands relaxed and slightly forward. The posture is natural and symmetrical, consistent with a neutral stance. The robotic nature of the arms does not affect their positioning, as they are designed to mimic human movement. In Image A, the arms are also positioned at the sides, though less of the full arm is visible due to the closer framing. The similarity in arm placement between the two images supports the conclusion that the arms are positioned naturally in both cases. No unnatural bending or extension is observed in Image B, confirming a natural pose.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the skin tone consistent with a natural light complexion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visible portions of the subject's skin—particularly around the face and neck—display a smooth, even tone that is light in color, consistent with a natural light complexion. The lighting is soft and diffused, minimizing shadows and highlights that could distort skin appearance. There are no signs of artificial coloring or texture anomalies that would suggest an unnatural skin tone. When comparing to Image A, the skin tone appears similar, indicating consistency across both images. The lack of discoloration or digital enhancement further supports the conclusion that the skin tone is natural.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are the lips closed in a neutral expression?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's lips are fully closed, forming a straight line with no visible smile or frown. The mouth is relaxed, and the surrounding facial muscles do not show tension or emotion, which is characteristic of a neutral expression. This is consistent with the expression seen in Image A, where the lips are also closed and the face appears calm and composed. The symmetry of the lips and the absence of any visible teeth or lip movement support the conclusion that the expression is neutral. This assessment is based on standard facial expression analysis and the visual cues present in both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
