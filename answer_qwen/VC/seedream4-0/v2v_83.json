      "question": "Does the skateboard retain its vibrant design with the sun motif and wavy lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is clearly visible and features a colorful design. The central element is a bright yellow crescent shape resembling a sun, surrounded by red and orange hues, which aligns with the 'sun motif' mentioned in the question. Below this, there are flowing, wavy lines in shades of blue, teal, pink, and purple, consistent with the description of 'wavy lines'. These elements match the visual style seen in Image A, confirming that the design has been preserved. The colors are vivid and the pattern is intact, indicating no loss or alteration in the artistic details.",

      "question": "Is the subject still wearing a red cap, black shirt, and beige jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a stylized, animated form. Despite the transformation into a cartoon-like appearance, the clothing remains consistent with the original: the subject wears a red cap, a black t-shirt underneath, and an open beige jacket. These items are clearly identifiable and match the attire seen in Image A. The color scheme and layering of clothing have been maintained, even though the style is now more illustrative and less photorealistic. This suggests that the outfit was intentionally preserved during the editing process.",

      "question": "Is the skateboard still positioned above the subject's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is not positioned above the subject's head. Instead, it is being held horizontally in front of the character at waist level, with both hands supporting it. In contrast, in Image A, the skateboard is suspended in mid-air directly above the person’s head, creating a dynamic pose. The change in position indicates that the edited version alters the composition significantly for stylistic or narrative purposes, possibly to emphasize the character's control over the board rather than the moment of action. Therefore, the positioning has changed.",

      "question": "Does the subject retain their facial features and expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's face has been transformed into a stylized, animated version. While the general shape of the face—such as the eyes, nose, and mouth—is recognizable, the proportions and expressions are simplified and exaggerated, typical of cartoon or game character designs. The original photo-realistic facial features from Image A (e.g., detailed skin texture, realistic eye shape, subtle expression) are no longer present. Instead, the character displays a cheerful, neutral smile with large eyes, which is characteristic of animated avatars. Thus, while the identity may be loosely preserved, the facial features and expression have been altered.",

      "question": "Does the subject maintain their confident stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject stands upright with a relaxed posture, feet shoulder-width apart, and one hand slightly raised while holding the skateboard. This conveys a sense of ease and self-assurance, consistent with a confident demeanor. Although the stance is not identical to the original image—where the person appears to be reacting to the skateboard floating above them—the overall body language in Image B still suggests confidence. The character’s posture is balanced and composed, typical of how protagonists are portrayed in animated or game-style profiles. Therefore, despite the change in context and medium, the essence of a confident stance is retained.",
