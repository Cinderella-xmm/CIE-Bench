      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla's eyes are clearly visible and appear to have a golden-yellow hue. This is consistent with the visual representation of the gorilla on the cereal box, where the eyes are rendered with a bright, warm tone that stands out against the dark fur. In real-world biology, gorillas typically have dark brown or black eyes, but in artistic representations—especially for commercial products like cereal boxes—the colors may be exaggerated or stylized for visual appeal. The golden-yellow eyes in this image are a deliberate design choice, likely to make the gorilla appear more striking and memorable. Therefore, based on the visual cues in Image B, the eyes are indeed golden-yellow.",

      "question": "Is there a prominent silver-colored crest on the top of the gorilla’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla’s head is shown from the front, and while it has a thick mane of dark fur, there is no visible silver-colored crest on the top of its head. Silver crests are characteristic of dominant male silverback gorillas, which develop a patch of silver hair along their back as they age. However, in this image, the gorilla’s fur appears uniformly dark across the head and body, with no indication of a silver patch. The lack of such a crest suggests either an artistic simplification or a depiction of a younger or non-dominant gorilla. Based on the visual evidence, the crest is absent.",

      "question": "Is the banana bunch composed of multiple yellow bananas curving outward from a common stem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana bunch held by the gorilla consists of numerous yellow bananas that radiate outward from a central green stem. This arrangement is typical of a natural banana cluster, where individual fruits grow from a shared stalk. The bananas are curved, with their tips pointing away from the stem, which aligns with the natural growth pattern of bananas. The depiction is realistic and matches common knowledge about how bananas grow on trees. Thus, the visual structure of the banana bunch in the image accurately reflects this biological feature.",

      "question": "Are both of the gorilla’s hands actively holding the banana bunch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla is shown holding the banana bunch with both hands. The left hand is clearly gripping the stem of the bananas, while the right hand is also positioned around the lower part of the bunch, supporting it. Both hands are engaged in the act of holding the fruit, indicating active involvement. This dual-hand grip is consistent with how large primates would naturally carry heavy objects. The positioning of the fingers and the way the bananas are cradled suggest balance and control, reinforcing the idea that both hands are used.",

      "question": "Does the gorilla have thick, dark fur with visible texture and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla’s fur is depicted as dense and dark, primarily black or deep gray in color. The rendering includes fine details such as individual strands of hair, shading, and highlights that give the fur a three-dimensional appearance. These visual elements create a sense of texture and depth, making the fur look realistic and tactile. Such detail is often enhanced in digital illustrations to convey realism, especially in product branding where lifelike imagery is desirable. Therefore, based on the visual cues, the fur does exhibit thickness, darkness, and visible texture.",

      "question": "Is the gorilla facing directly forward, making eye contact with the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla is positioned so that its face is oriented straight toward the camera. Its eyes are aligned with the viewer’s perspective, creating a direct gaze. This frontal pose is intentional and commonly used in advertising to establish engagement and connection with the audience. The symmetry of the face and the alignment of the eyes confirm that the gorilla is looking directly forward. Even though this might be a stylized representation, the visual cues strongly support the conclusion that the gorilla is making eye contact with the viewer.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas show small brown spots and minor imperfections on their peels. These markings are scattered across the surface of the fruit, particularly near the tips and along the curves. Brown spots are common on ripe bananas and are a natural result of aging and enzymatic activity. Their presence adds to the realism of the depiction, suggesting that the bananas are fresh but not artificially perfect. This attention to detail enhances the authenticity of the image, even within a stylized context. Thus, the bananas do display visible blemishes.",
