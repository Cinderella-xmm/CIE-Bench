      "question": "Is the dragon-headed prow with detailed carvings and open jaws present at the front of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the ship depicted on the box art clearly shows a dragon-headed prow. The head is intricately carved with patterns typical of Norse art, including interwoven designs and sharp features. The mouth is open, revealing teeth, which is consistent with traditional Viking longship depictions. This detail aligns with historical and cultural representations of Viking ships, where dragon or serpent heads were often used to intimidate enemies and symbolize power. The visual evidence in the image confirms the presence of such a feature.",

      "question": "Is the dark red and black circular knotwork emblem centered on the beige sail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sail on the ship depicted in Image B features a prominent circular emblem in the center. This emblem displays intricate knotwork, characteristic of Norse or Celtic designs, rendered in dark red and black tones against the beige background of the sail. This motif is consistent with Viking artistic traditions, where such symbols were often used for decoration and symbolic meaning. The visual clarity of the emblem in the image supports this observation.",

      "question": "Are multiple circular shields with distinct symbols mounted along the side of the ship beneath the oars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the side of the ship in Image B, there are several circular shields visible beneath the oars. Each shield has a unique symbol or design, such as crosses, stars, or other geometric patterns. These shields are arranged in a row, consistent with historical depictions of Viking longships, where warriors would hang their shields along the hull for protection and display. The presence of these shields, each with distinct markings, is clearly visible in the artwork.",

      "question": "Are there multiple oars extending outward from the hull, each connected to a small human-like figure representing a rower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows numerous oars extending from the side of the ship, each appearing to be attached to a small human-like figure positioned below them. These figures are stylized representations of rowers, consistent with how Viking longships were manned. While the figures are not highly detailed, their placement and connection to the oars suggest they represent rowers. This setup is historically accurate, as Viking ships relied on rowing for propulsion, and the depiction in the image reflects this.",

      "question": "Does the hull consist of clearly defined horizontal wooden planks with visible grain and layered construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hull of the ship in Image B is constructed from what appears to be horizontal wooden planks, with visible wood grain and layered structure. The planks are aligned in a way that mimics traditional clinker-built ship construction, where overlapping planks were used to create a strong and flexible hull. This method was common in Viking shipbuilding, and the visual details in the image—such as the texture and layering—support this interpretation.",

      "question": "Is there a single central mast supporting a square-shaped sail that is fully unfurled and attached via ropes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ship in Image B has a single central mast located near the middle of the vessel. Attached to this mast is a square-shaped sail that is fully unfurled and secured with ropes running from the top and sides of the sail to the ship’s frame. This configuration is typical of Viking longships, which often had one large square sail for sailing purposes. The sail is clearly visible and properly rigged, indicating it is functional within the context of the artwork.",
