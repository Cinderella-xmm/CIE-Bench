      "question": "Does the edited image retain the model’s original facial features, including dark eyes, defined cheekbones, and full lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model's face is depicted in a stylized, illustrative manner. Despite the artistic rendering, key facial features such as dark eyes, prominent cheekbones, and full lips are still clearly represented. The artist has maintained the general structure and proportions of the face consistent with the original model’s appearance, suggesting an intentional preservation of her distinctive features. This aligns with common practices in fashion illustrations where recognizable traits are retained even when styles are abstracted. The symmetry and emphasis on facial contours support this conclusion.",

      "question": "Is the model’s long, straight black hair parted down the middle still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model's hair is illustrated as long and straight, parted down the center. While the style is simplified and stylized compared to the photorealistic version in Image A, the core characteristics—length, straightness, and central parting—are preserved. Fashion illustrations often simplify hair texture but maintain its overall shape and styling for recognition. Thus, based on visual cues and common illustration techniques, the hair remains consistent with the original description.",

      "question": "Is the wide silver crystal choker necklace still visible around the model’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a decorative necklace is clearly visible around the model’s neck. It is rendered in a way that suggests sparkle and width, consistent with a silver crystal choker. Although the material is not physically reflective like in a photograph, the design elements—such as clustered shapes and reflective highlights—indicate it is meant to represent the same accessory seen in Image A. In fashion illustrations, accessories are often stylized but remain identifiable by their form and placement. Therefore, the choker is present and visually matched to the original.",

      "question": "Does the model maintain the same upright stance with hands clasped at the waist and legs slightly apart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model stands upright with her legs positioned slightly apart, mirroring the posture from Image A. Her hands are brought together at the waist, consistent with the original pose. While the illustration uses clean lines and minimal shading, the body alignment and limb positioning are accurately preserved. This reflects standard practice in fashion illustrations to maintain poses for continuity and presentation purposes. Hence, the stance is effectively retained.",

      "question": "Are both hands positioned together at the waist, holding the bag handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands are shown clasped together at the waist, gripping the chain of a small handbag. The bag is drawn with a chain handle that extends from the front of the dress, and both hands are clearly interacting with it. This matches the action in Image A, where the model holds the bag handle with both hands. Even though the drawing is stylized, the functional and spatial relationship between the hands and the bag is preserved, indicating intentional continuity in gesture and object interaction.",

      "question": "Are the model’s natural skin tone and body proportions preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model’s skin tone is depicted in a uniform light beige color, which is typical in fashion illustrations to emphasize form over realism. While the actual natural skin tone may have been altered for stylistic reasons (e.g., to match the art style or enhance contrast), the body proportions—such as leg length, torso size, and arm placement—are proportionally accurate relative to the original figure. Fashion illustrations often use idealized proportions but generally preserve the subject’s silhouette and balance. Thus, while the skin tone is stylized, the overall body proportions are maintained.",
