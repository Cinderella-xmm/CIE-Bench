      "question": "Is the brand name \"WARING\" displayed in bold white capital letters on a black rectangular plaque with a textured border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging box features an image of the food processor. On the front of the appliance depicted on the box, the brand name 'WARING' is clearly visible. It is presented in bold, white, uppercase letters on a black rectangular background. The plaque has a subtle textured or mesh-like pattern around its edges, which gives it a distinct visual border. This matches the description provided in the question. The use of bold white text on a dark background is typical for branding to ensure visibility and contrast, especially on appliances. The design aligns with common product labeling practices where the brand name is emphasized for recognition.",

      "question": "Are the control buttons labeled \"OFF\" (red), \"ON\" (green), and \"PULSE\" (blue) arranged horizontally on the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the control panel of the food processor shown on the box displays three buttons arranged in a horizontal row. From left to right, the labels are 'OFF' (in red), 'ON' (in green), and 'PULSE' (in blue). The color coding follows standard conventions: red for off, green for on, and blue for pulse functions, which helps users quickly identify their functions. The arrangement is consistent with typical food processor designs where controls are placed in a linear fashion for ease of access. The depiction on the box accurately reflects this layout, indicating that the actual product likely follows the same configuration.",

      "question": "Does the processing bowl have a black handle attached to its left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the food processor shown on the box has a processing bowl with a black handle visibly attached to its left side. The handle is ergonomically shaped, suggesting it is designed for easy lifting and handling of the bowl when removing it from the base. This is a common feature in food processors to allow safe and convenient transfer of contents. The handle's placement on the left side is consistent with standard design practices, ensuring balance and accessibility during operation. The image on the box clearly shows this feature, confirming its presence.",

      "question": "Is there a transparent lid covering the bowl with a vertical feed tube and a pusher mechanism visible at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the food processor depicted on the box shows a transparent lid covering the processing bowl. The lid includes a vertical feed tube extending upward from the center, which is used to add ingredients during operation. At the top of the feed tube, a pusher mechanism is visible, which is typically used to safely guide food into the chopping blade without direct hand contact. The transparency of the lid allows users to monitor the processing progress, which is a standard safety and usability feature in modern food processors. The image on the box clearly illustrates these components, confirming their presence.",

      "question": "Is the feed tube a tall, vertical cylinder extending upward from the center of the lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the food processor shown on the box has a feed tube that is indeed a tall, vertical cylinder rising from the center of the transparent lid. This design is typical for food processors, allowing users to add ingredients gradually while the machine is running. The cylindrical shape ensures smooth flow of materials into the bowl. The height of the tube is sufficient to accommodate various food items and the pusher mechanism. The visual representation on the box accurately reflects this structural feature, which is essential for functionality.",

      "question": "Is the base of the food processor silver metallic with black feet at the bottom corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the food processor shown on the box appears to be made of a silver metallic material, giving it a sleek, durable look. At the bottom corners of the base, black feet are visible, which serve to stabilize the appliance and prevent slipping during operation. These feet are commonly included in kitchen appliances to provide grip on countertops. The combination of a metallic base and black feet is both functional and aesthetically pleasing, matching modern kitchen appliance design trends. The image on the box clearly depicts this detail.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the food processor maintain the same proportional relationship between the base, bowl, and feed tube as shown in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To assess proportionality, we compare Image B (the box image) with Image A (the original product image). In Image A, the food processor has a well-balanced design: the base is wide and sturdy, supporting a bowl of moderate size, and the feed tube extends vertically from the lid without appearing disproportionate. In Image B, the same food processor is depicted on the box, and despite being a 2D representation, the proportions appear consistent with Image A. The base, bowl, and feed tube maintain the same relative sizes and spatial relationships. There is no visual distortion or scaling difference that would suggest a change in proportions. Therefore, based on visual analysis and common product packaging practices (which aim to accurately represent the product), the proportional relationship is preserved.",
