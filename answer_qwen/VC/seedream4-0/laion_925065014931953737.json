      "question": "Is the \"S\" emblem present on the chest of the character, with a shield shape, red outer border, yellow/gold inner field, and red \"S\" lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is a stylized, cartoonish representation of Superman, designed in a chibi or kawaii art style. The 'S' emblem on the chest is clearly visible and features a shield-like shape. The outer border of the emblem is red, the inner field is yellow/gold, and the 'S' lettering itself is red. This matches the classic design of Superman's emblem, albeit simplified for the cartoon aesthetic. The visual cues—such as the distinct color separation and the iconic 'S' shape—are consistent with the traditional Superman logo, even in this stylized form. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and common knowledge of Superman's costume, the emblem meets all the specified criteria.",

      "question": "Is there a red cape attached at the shoulders and extending downward behind the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character has a red cape that is attached at the shoulders and flows downward behind the figure. The cape is clearly depicted as part of the costume and extends from the upper back area, draping down symmetrically. This aligns with the typical depiction of Superman’s cape in both animated and toy representations. While it is stylized and simplified due to the cartoon nature of the image, the presence and positioning of the cape are unmistakable. There is no ambiguity in the visual cues indicating the cape's attachment point or direction. Thus, based on the visual information and general knowledge of Superman's costume, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Is the character wearing a predominantly blue suit that covers the torso and arms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character wearing a suit that covers the torso and arms, primarily in blue. The suit includes textured patterns resembling scales or armor, which are common in modern interpretations of Superman's costume. The blue color dominates the body, including the arms and chest, with only small areas (like the belt and emblem) featuring other colors. Even though the style is cartoonish and exaggerated, the primary color of the suit remains blue, and it fully covers the torso and arms. This is consistent with the standard Superman costume design. Hence, the description matches the visual content.",

      "question": "Are there gold or yellow accents present on the \"S\" emblem and/or the belt area of the suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'S' emblem on the chest has a yellow/gold inner field, which is a gold accent. Additionally, the belt buckle is also yellow/gold in color, providing another clear gold accent. These elements are consistent with the traditional Superman costume, where gold/yellow accents are used on both the emblem and belt. Although the design is simplified and stylized, the presence of these gold/yellow features is evident. Therefore, based on visual analysis and knowledge of Superman’s costume, the answer is yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is depicted in an upright stance, standing straight with arms positioned at the sides of the body. The posture is symmetrical, and the limbs are aligned vertically, suggesting a neutral, standing position. This is typical for collectible figures or magnets designed to represent characters in a static pose. The arms are not raised, crossed, or bent; they hang naturally by the sides. This matches the description of an upright stance with arms at the sides. Thus, the visual cues support the conclusion.",

      "question": "Are the dominant colors of the costume red, blue, and gold/yellow, with high contrast between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The costume in Image B uses red, blue, and gold/yellow as its dominant colors. The suit is primarily blue, the cape and boots are red, and the 'S' emblem and belt buckle are gold/yellow. These colors are highly contrasting, especially between the red and blue, and the gold/yellow stands out against both. This high contrast is a hallmark of Superman’s costume design, intended to make the character visually striking and easily recognizable. The use of bold, distinct colors is consistent across both traditional and stylized versions of the character. Therefore, the visual evidence supports the claim that the dominant colors are red, blue, and gold/yellow with strong contrast.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'S' emblem is located centrally on the chest of the character. It is positioned directly in the middle of the torso, aligned with the vertical centerline of the body. This central placement is a defining feature of Superman’s costume, regardless of the artistic style. Even in this cartoonish rendition, the emblem is symmetrically placed and clearly centered. This aligns with both visual observation and established knowledge of Superman’s design. Thus, the emblem’s location is correctly described.",
