      "question": "Are the woman’s eyes clearly visible with almond-shaped pupils and defined eyeliner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's eyes are prominently displayed and stylized in a cartoon or anime art style. The eyes are large, with distinct almond-shaped pupils, which is a common feature in animated characters to convey expressiveness. The eyeliner is clearly defined, with thick, dark lines extending slightly upward at the outer corners, enhancing the dramatic effect typical of such artistic styles. This aligns with common conventions in anime and manga where exaggerated features like large eyes and bold eyeliner are used to emphasize emotion and character expression. Therefore, based on visual cues and world knowledge of animation aesthetics, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Do the earrings consist of long, golden tassels hanging from the earlobes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the earrings are clearly visible and match the description of long, golden tassels. Each earring has a small golden bead at the top, followed by a series of elongated, dangling elements that resemble tassels. These tassels hang vertically from the earlobes and are rendered in a consistent golden color, suggesting they are made of a metallic or decorative material. This design is consistent with traditional Chinese jewelry often paired with qipao attire, where ornate, dangling earrings are common. The visual details confirm the presence of long, golden tassels.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is wearing a qipao with a clearly visible high-standing collar, characteristic of traditional Chinese clothing. The collar is outlined with a blue trim that contrasts with the red fabric of the dress. This blue trim runs along the edge of the collar and continues down the front closure, forming part of the decorative border. The mandarin collar is a defining feature of the qipao, and its presence here is consistent with both the visual evidence and cultural knowledge of the garment. Thus, the description matches the image.",

      "question": "Are there blue frog closures running vertically down the center front of the qipao?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the qipao features a vertical row of decorative closures known as 'frog buttons' or 'qipao knots.' These closures are rendered in blue, matching the trim of the collar and sleeve edges. They are positioned symmetrically along the center front of the dress, connecting the two sides of the garment. The design includes intricate knot-like patterns, typical of traditional Chinese fastenings. Based on visual inspection and cultural understanding of qipao construction, these are indeed blue frog closures arranged vertically.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s hair is styled in an elegant updo, with the majority of her hair gathered and pinned at the back of her head. Two distinct loose strands of hair fall gently on either side of her face, framing it. This hairstyle is common in traditional or formal settings, especially when paired with a qipao, as it enhances facial features while maintaining a refined look. The visual evidence confirms the presence of the updo and the two loose strands, making this description accurate.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary color of the qipao is clearly red. The fabric appears to be a rich, satin-like material with a glossy finish, which reflects light and enhances the vibrancy of the red hue. Red is a traditional and symbolic color in Chinese culture, often associated with luck, prosperity, and celebration, especially in garments like the qipao worn during festivals or weddings. The entire body of the dress, including the sleeves and torso, is predominantly red, confirming the description.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s right hand is visible and positioned near her chest area. Her fingers are slightly curled, forming a relaxed yet deliberate pose, possibly holding a small object (such as envelopes) in her hands. The positioning of the hand is consistent with a poised or graceful stance, common in formal portraits or celebratory scenes. The hand is not fully extended nor clenched, but rather gently curved, which matches the description provided.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the qipao features detailed floral embroidery across the chest and upper sleeves. The patterns include stylized flowers, likely peonies or chrysanthemums, which are traditional motifs in Chinese textile design. These floral elements are rendered in lighter colors such as cream and pink, contrasting against the red background. The embroidery extends from the chest area up into the sleeves, indicating a consistent decorative pattern. This is typical of ornate qipao designs, where floral motifs symbolize beauty and prosperity. The visual evidence supports the presence of these embroidered patterns.",
