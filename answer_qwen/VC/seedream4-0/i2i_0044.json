      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich is depicted in a stylized, cartoon-like manner with exaggerated brushstrokes and vibrant colors. Despite the artistic rendering, the cross-section of the sandwich is still clearly visible. The layers of ingredients—such as lettuce, cheese, meat, and possibly onions—are distinctly separated and identifiable through color contrast and placement. The bread’s texture and the arrangement of fillings are emphasized in a way that maintains clarity about the internal structure. This visual clarity is achieved even though the image is not photorealistic, thanks to deliberate artistic choices that preserve structural details. Therefore, based on the visual cues and common understanding of how sandwiches are represented in stylized art, the cross-section remains clear.",

      "question": "Does the sandwich bread retain its golden-brown crust appearance despite the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bread of the sandwich is rendered in warm tones, predominantly shades of orange and brown, which closely resemble the golden-brown crust typical of baked bread. Although the image uses an impressionistic, painterly style with visible brushstrokes, the color palette and shading suggest a toasted or freshly baked crust. The surface texture includes darker spots and irregular patterns consistent with real bread crusts, reinforcing this perception. Even in stylized depictions, artists often maintain recognizable features like color and texture to preserve realism within abstraction. Thus, the bread retains the essential visual characteristics of a golden-brown crust.",

      "question": "Does the sandwich remain on the white, rectangular plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sandwich placed on a flat, white surface with sharp edges and a rectangular shape, consistent with a plate. The background elements, such as the wooden table and the surrounding environment, confirm that this surface is indeed a plate. The plate's color is uniformly white, and it has a clean, defined border, matching the description of a white, rectangular plate. Even though the image is stylized, the geometric form and context (e.g., serving food) support the conclusion that the sandwich is on the same type of plate as in the original image. There is no indication of a change in the plate’s shape or color.",

      "question": "Does the background still depict a wooden table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a surface with horizontal lines and warm brown tones, consistent with wood grain. The texture and coloration mimic a wooden table, and the perspective aligns with a tabletop view beneath the plate. While the style is painterly, the artist has preserved the key visual cues of wood—such as parallel lines and variations in tone—that are typically used to represent wooden surfaces in art. Additionally, the lighting and shadows suggest a solid, flat surface suitable for placing a plate, further supporting the identification as a wooden table. This matches the expected background from the original image, maintaining consistency in setting.",

      "question": "Is the sandwich positioned centrally on the plate as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich is placed slightly off-center toward the left side of the plate, rather than being perfectly centered. While the overall composition is balanced, the sandwich does not occupy the central axis of the plate. In contrast, in Image A (the original), the sandwich appears more symmetrically placed, closer to the center. The artistic interpretation in Image B introduces a slight shift in positioning, possibly for visual emphasis or stylistic balance. Therefore, although the sandwich is still on the plate, its position deviates from the central alignment seen in the original image.",
