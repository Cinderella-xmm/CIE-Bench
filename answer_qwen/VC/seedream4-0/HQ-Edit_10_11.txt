    "Question": "Q1: Is the gorilla depicted in a seated pose with its left hand resting under its chin?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla is clearly shown in a seated position. Observing the positioning of its limbs, the left arm is bent and raised, with the hand placed under the chin in a contemplative gesture. This posture is consistent with a 'thinking' pose often seen in artistic representations. The details of the wood carving show clear definition in the fingers and hand placement, confirming that the left hand is indeed under the chin. This conclusion is drawn from direct visual inspection of the hand's location relative to the face and body orientation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the gorilla have a prominent brow ridge, wide nose, and strong jawline consistent with a silverback gorilla?",
    "explanation": "The carved gorilla in Image B exhibits facial features typical of a silverback gorilla. The brow ridge is visibly pronounced, extending over the eyes, which is a hallmark of mature male gorillas. The nose appears broad and flat, and the jawline is well-defined and strong, contributing to a robust facial structure. These characteristics are consistent with biological knowledge of silverback gorillas, even though this is a wooden sculpture. The artist has captured these anatomical traits accurately, reflecting real-world primate morphology.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a distinct patch resembling a silver saddle located across the back and shoulders of the gorilla?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla is made entirely of wood, and its surface texture mimics fur through carved lines. However, there is no visible light-colored or silver-toned area on the back and shoulders that would represent the 'silver saddle' characteristic of adult male gorillas. Instead, the entire figure is uniformly brown, matching the wood grain. The absence of any contrasting color or texture in that region indicates that the silver saddle is not present in this representation. Therefore, despite accurate anatomical proportions, the defining feature of a silverback is missing due to the medium and artistic choice.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the gorilla positioned on a horizontal surface that resembles a log or platform?",
    "explanation": "The gorilla in Image B is seated on a horizontally oriented object that closely resembles a tree branch or log. This element is intricately carved with bark-like textures and natural contours, suggesting it is meant to represent a wooden log. It lies flat and supports the weight of the gorilla, functioning as a platform. The surrounding background also features wood grain patterns, reinforcing the idea that this is part of a larger wooden composition. Thus, based on visual cues and common sense about how such sculptures are constructed, the gorilla is indeed on a log-like surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the gorilla’s right arm resting on its right knee?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla's right arm is extended downward and rests on the surface beneath it, not on the right knee. The right leg is bent at the knee, but the forearm does not make contact with the knee. Instead, the right hand is placed on the log or platform, supporting the body. This can be confirmed by analyzing the spatial relationship between the arm, hand, and leg. The left arm is elevated, while the right arm is lower and more relaxed. Therefore, the right arm is not resting on the right knee.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the gorilla’s gaze directed forward and slightly downward?",
    "explanation": "The carved gorilla in Image B has its eyes positioned to look directly ahead, with a slight downward tilt in the angle of the head and eyes. This gives the impression of contemplation or introspection. The direction of the gaze aligns with the overall thoughtful pose, and the depth of the eye sockets and positioning of the pupils support this interpretation. Based on the orientation of the facial features and the general posture, the gaze is indeed forward and slightly downward, consistent with a reflective demeanor.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there leaf-shaped elements present in the background, even if stylized or etched?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a wooden surface with various engraved and possibly inlaid leaf shapes. These leaves are scattered around the gorilla, both above and below it, and are rendered in darker tones compared to the lighter wood. Some appear as simple outlines, while others are more detailed with veins. Although they are not realistic leaves, their shape and arrangement clearly suggest foliage. Even if stylized or etched, the presence of leaf-like forms is evident throughout the background. This artistic choice enhances the naturalistic theme of the sculpture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
