      "question": "Is the subject’s beard and mustache present and white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's facial hair, including both the beard and mustache, is clearly visible. The rendering style is watercolor-like, but the coloration of the facial hair is predominantly white with subtle gray tones, consistent with an older individual. The artistic interpretation maintains the realistic appearance of white hair, even though it is stylized. Based on visual cues and common knowledge about aging and facial hair representation in portraits, the beard and mustache are indeed present and white.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the subject have short, graying white hair with a visible receding hairline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair is depicted as short and primarily white, with some hints of gray, which aligns with typical representations of aging individuals. The hairline appears to recede slightly at the temples, a common characteristic in older men. Although the image is a painted portrait, the stylistic choices preserve anatomical accuracy, particularly around the forehead and crown area. The receding hairline is subtly indicated through the way the hair is drawn back from the front of the head, consistent with natural aging patterns. This matches real-world observations of similar individuals.",

      "question": "Is the subject’s mouth slightly open, indicating speech?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s mouth is rendered in a slightly open position, with the lips parted enough to suggest articulation or mid-speech. The expression, combined with the positioning of the jaw and the slight tension around the mouth, supports the inference that the subject is speaking. While this is a painted portrait, the artist has captured a dynamic facial expression that implies vocalization. This interpretation is reinforced by the context of the original photograph (Image A), where the same expression is evident, suggesting continuity in portrayal.",

      "question": "Is the subject wearing a dark suit jacket over a white dress shirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted wearing a dark-colored suit jacket, rendered in deep blue tones with gold pinstripes, which is consistent with formal attire. Beneath the jacket, a white dress shirt is clearly visible, particularly around the collar and neck area. The style and color match typical business or formal wear. Even though the medium is watercolor, the clothing details are preserved with sufficient clarity to confirm the presence of both a dark suit jacket and a white dress shirt. This aligns with standard portrayals of professional individuals in such settings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a tie is clearly visible at the subject’s neck, tied in what appears to be a standard knot, likely a four-in-hand or Windsor style. The tie features a patterned design with red and possibly other colors, consistent with formal wear. Despite the artistic interpretation using watercolor techniques, the shape and placement of the knot are recognizable as conventional. The knot sits neatly at the collar, and the tie drapes down the chest, which is typical for formal attire. This observation is supported by the consistency with the original image (Image A), where a similar tie is worn.",

      "question": "Are the subject’s eyes positioned symmetrically, with visible wrinkles around them, and a prominent nose and jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s eyes are positioned symmetrically within the face, aligned horizontally, which is typical for human facial structure. There are visible wrinkles around the eyes, especially near the outer corners (crow’s feet), indicating age and expression. The nose is well-defined and prominent, and the jawline is clearly outlined, giving the face a strong, structured appearance. These features are rendered with attention to anatomical detail, even in the stylized watercolor format. The symmetry and facial landmarks align with realistic depictions of the subject, as seen in Image A, confirming their presence and proportionality.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the subject’s face suggests illumination from the front-right direction. The right side of the face (viewer’s left) is brighter, with highlights on the cheekbone, forehead, and nose, while the left side (viewer’s right) shows softer shadows, particularly under the jaw and along the temple. This directional lighting creates depth and dimension, consistent with studio or indoor lighting setups. The shadowing effect is subtle but noticeable, especially in the contrast between the lit and shaded areas. This lighting direction matches the original photograph (Image A), where the same lighting pattern is evident, reinforcing the conclusion.",
