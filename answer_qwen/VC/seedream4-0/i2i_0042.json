      "question": "Is the subject's arms-raised pose preserved in the chibi-style figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure is depicted with both arms raised in a triumphant or celebratory gesture, similar to the original subject's pose in Image A. The arms are bent at the elbows and lifted upward, forming a 'V' shape, which aligns with the typical expression of excitement or victory. This pose matches the energetic posture seen in the original image, where the person has their arms outstretched. While the style is cartoonish, the core action—arms raised—is preserved. This conclusion is drawn from visual comparison of limb positioning and body language, combined with common understanding of expressive gestures in both real-life and animated representations.",

      "question": "Are the multiple plates of burgers, fries, and drinks still present on the table in the same positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table contains a simplified version of the meal setup: one large burger with fries, a smaller burger, two drinks, a ketchup bottle, and a glass. However, the number of plates is significantly reduced compared to Image A, where there were five distinct meals arranged around the table. In Image B, only two main food items are visible, and they are centrally placed rather than distributed across the table as before. The arrangement is stylized and condensed for the chibi aesthetic, but it does not preserve the original multiplicity or spatial distribution. Therefore, while some elements are present, the quantity and positioning have changed substantially.",

      "question": "Is the table still circular with a blue surface and metallic edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table retains its circular shape and features a bright blue surface, consistent with the original table in Image A. The metallic edge is also visible, particularly along the outer rim of the table, reflecting light and maintaining the same design detail. These characteristics are preserved even though the overall image has been stylized into a cartoon format. The use of clear outlines and shading suggests that the designer intentionally kept the table’s physical attributes intact to maintain scene continuity. Thus, based on visual cues and the consistency of design elements, the table’s form and materials appear unchanged.",

      "question": "Is the red booth surrounding the subject still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red booth is clearly visible, surrounding the chibi character on all sides. The curved backrest and seat cushions maintain the same color and shape as in Image A, indicating that the booth has been retained in the edited version. Although the image is stylized, the red upholstery and the semicircular structure are consistent with the original setting. This preservation suggests that the environment was intentionally kept to provide context and continuity, reinforcing the scene's identity despite the transformation of the subject into a cartoon figure.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure still display a cheerful facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figure in Image B has a simplified face with large eyes, rosy cheeks, and a small smile, which are typical features used to convey happiness in anime and cartoon art styles. Although the expression is minimalistic, the combination of these elements—especially the upward-curved mouth and bright eyes—indicates a cheerful or content mood. This aligns with the original subject’s joyful demeanor in Image A, where he is laughing with an open mouth and wide eyes. Despite the stylistic change, the emotional tone is preserved through conventional cartoon expressions of joy. Therefore, the facial expression can be interpreted as cheerful based on standard visual cues in character design.",
