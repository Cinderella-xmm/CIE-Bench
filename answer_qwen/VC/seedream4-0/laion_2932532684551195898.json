      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's face has a smooth, uniform skin tone that is natural and unadorned with any white base paint. The facial features are stylized in a cartoonish, doll-like manner, typical of a collectible figure or toy design. There is no visible white base layer on the face, which is commonly used in traditional 'Day of the Dead' (Día de Muertos) makeup to create a skull-like appearance. Instead, the face appears to be made of a matte material with a soft peach tone, consistent with the aesthetic of a figurine rather than a person wearing face paint. Therefore, based on visual cues and knowledge of both traditional makeup practices and stylized doll designs, the white base is not present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are simplified and stylized. The mouth is depicted as a small, curved red line without any stitching details. The cheeks have rosy blush marks but lack any black lines resembling stitches. In contrast, traditional sugar skull makeup often includes black stitched lines around the mouth and cheeks to mimic sutures, symbolizing death and rebirth. However, this stylized representation does not include such elements. Thus, the black stitched lines are absent in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows large, expressive eyes with long lashes, but there are no red floral patterns surrounding them. Instead, the eye area is clean and minimalistic, focusing on the oversized pupils and eyelashes. Traditional sugar skull makeup typically includes intricate floral designs around the eyes, often in red or pink hues. Since these decorative elements are missing in Image B, it is clear that the red floral designs are not present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are large and cartoonish, with dark pupils and prominent black eyelashes. However, there is no visible purple eyeshadow applied to the eyelids. The coloration around the eyes is limited to natural skin tones and black outlines, typical of animated or toy-like characters. While the lashes are long and exaggerated, they do not resemble real false lashes but rather part of the sculpted design. Therefore, although long lashes are present, the purple eyeshadow is not.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The forehead in Image B is smooth and unadorned, lacking any decorative patterns. In traditional Day of the Dead makeup, a blue spiderweb with golden accents is sometimes painted on the forehead to symbolize the connection between life and death. However, in this stylized image, the forehead is plain, showing only a flat surface with no intricate designs. Thus, the blue spiderweb pattern with golden dots is not present.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headdress features large, vibrant orange and yellow flowers made of fabric-like material, positioned on either side of the head. These flowers are clearly visible and match the description of traditional marigold-style blooms often used in Día de Muertos celebrations. The texture and color suggest they are crafted from fabric or paper, consistent with cultural decorations. Therefore, the orange and yellow fabric flowers are indeed present.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character’s hair styled into braids that incorporate black, orange, and yellow strands. These colors are woven together in a pattern that matches the festive theme associated with Day of the Dead attire. The braids are clearly visible and extend from the top of the head down the sides, consistent with traditional Mexican hairstyles during cultural festivals. Thus, the multicolored braids are present.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the earrings are golden in color and feature small bear-shaped charms hanging from them. While they are ornate, they do not display the intricate filigree patterns seen in traditional jewelry. Instead, they are simple, stylized pendants with a cartoonish animal motif. The original image (Image A) likely featured elaborate golden filigree earrings, but in Image B, the design has been changed to a more playful, toy-like style. Therefore, the golden filigree pattern is not retained.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the headdress in Image B, there are green leaf-like elements attached to the orange and yellow flowers. These appear to be artificial leaves, possibly made of fabric or plastic, designed to complement the floral arrangement. Such greenery is common in traditional headdresses for cultural events like Día de Muertos, where marigolds are often paired with foliage. Therefore, green leaves are indeed visible.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheeks of the character have noticeable pink circular markings, which resemble blush. These are a stylistic element commonly used in cartoon or doll representations to convey cuteness or youthfulness. Although the blush is not applied in a realistic manner like in human makeup, it is clearly present as a painted or sculpted feature. Thus, the pink blush is visible.",
