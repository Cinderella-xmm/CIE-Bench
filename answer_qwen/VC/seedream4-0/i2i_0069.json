      "question": "Is the sandwich's crust depicted as having a golden-brown, crusty texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich's crust appears to be well-baked with a rich, golden-brown color and visible surface texture that suggests a crusty exterior. The lighting enhances the depth and ridges of the bread, which are characteristic of a freshly baked baguette-style roll. This visual cue, combined with common knowledge about sandwich bread appearance—especially in sub sandwiches—supports the conclusion that the crust is indeed depicted as crusty and golden-brown. There are no signs of paleness or softness that would suggest otherwise.",

      "question": "Are the layers of tomatoes, lettuce, and cheese visible within the sandwich?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the fillings inside the sandwich are clearly visible. Red slices consistent with tomato, green leafy portions resembling lettuce, and white creamy sections matching the appearance of cheese (likely provolone or mozzarella) can be identified along the length of the sandwich. These ingredients are layered in a way typical of a classic submarine sandwich. The clarity of these components, even under the ambient lighting and digital overlay, confirms their presence and visibility.",

      "question": "Is the knife positioned parallel and adjacent to the sandwich on the parchment paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife is placed directly below the sandwich on the parchment paper. Its blade runs horizontally, aligned with the long axis of the sandwich, indicating it is parallel. It is also close enough to be considered adjacent, suggesting it was used or is ready to be used for cutting. This positioning is consistent with how one might naturally place a knife next to a sandwich for slicing. No significant angle or gap disrupts this alignment.",

      "question": "Does the background show a detailed tablecloth pattern beneath the parchment paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a patterned surface beneath the parchment paper, which appears to be a tablecloth. The design includes text-like elements and faded red and gray tones, resembling an old newspaper or vintage print. This pattern is visible through the translucent areas of the parchment paper and around its edges. Given that such patterns are commonly used in food photography for aesthetic appeal, the detailed nature of the design supports the conclusion that a patterned tablecloth is present beneath the parchment paper.",

      "question": "Is the sandwich still resting on a clean sheet of white parchment paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the parchment paper in Image B is white, it is not clean. There are visible crumbs, grease stains, and smudges, especially near the base of the sandwich and along the paper’s edge. These marks indicate prior use or contact with the sandwich’s oils and fillings. Therefore, despite being white, the parchment paper is not clean. This observation contrasts with what might be expected in a pristine setup but aligns with realistic food presentation where residue from the sandwich is natural.",
