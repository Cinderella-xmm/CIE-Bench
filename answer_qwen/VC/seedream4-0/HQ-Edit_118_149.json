      "question": "Is the dancer’s left leg extended vertically upward in a full arabesque, with the right foot en pointe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is depicted in a stylized, geometric art form on a notebook cover. The figure shows one leg raised high behind her, which aligns with the posture of an arabesque. However, in a full arabesque, the leg should be fully extended and aligned with the spine, typically at 90 degrees or higher, and the supporting leg should be straight and en pointe. In this image, the raised leg appears to be bent at the knee slightly, and the supporting leg (right) is indeed en pointe, but the overall alignment suggests it's not a full arabesque due to the angular distortion typical of the geometric style. The pose resembles an arabesque but lacks the precision of a full extension. Therefore, while close, it does not meet the strict definition of a full arabesque.",

      "question": "Are both feet wearing pink pointe shoes with visible ribbons wrapped around the ankles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's feet are illustrated in a geometric, abstract style. Both feet appear to be wearing pointe shoes, and the design includes elements resembling ribbons around the ankles. However, due to the stylized nature of the artwork, the details are simplified and fragmented into triangular shapes. While the general form suggests pointe shoes with ribbons, the ribbons are not clearly defined as continuous or wrapped in a realistic manner. The visual cues suggest the presence of ribbons, but they are not distinctly visible as they would be in a photorealistic depiction. Thus, based on the artistic abstraction, we cannot confirm with certainty that the ribbons are visibly wrapped.",

      "question": "Is the dancer’s hair styled into a tight, round bun at the top of her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's hair is represented in a geometric, low-poly style. Despite the abstraction, the shape of the hair at the back of the head forms a compact, rounded structure consistent with a bun. It is positioned at the crown of the head and appears tightly formed, matching the typical appearance of a ballet bun. Although the style is not realistic, the visual cues—such as the compactness and placement—align with the standard representation of a ballet bun in both real life and stylized art. Therefore, even with the geometric distortion, the intent and form suggest a tight, round bun.",

      "question": "Does the dancer wear a sleeveless, fitted pink leotard paired with white tights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's attire is rendered in a geometric, polygonal style. The garment covering the torso is sleeveless and closely follows the contours of the body, indicating a fitted leotard. The color palette includes shades of pink, consistent with a ballet leotard. The lower limbs are covered in a lighter tone, suggesting white tights. Although the colors are abstracted into triangles, the overall design and proportions match the description of a pink leotard with white tights. This interpretation is supported by common knowledge of ballet attire and the visual consistency of the outfit in the context of dance-themed illustrations.",

      "question": "Is one arm extended forward and slightly out to the side, while the other grips the barre?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's arms are depicted in a stylized manner. One arm is clearly extended outward and upward, resembling a classic ballet arm position, but it is not gripping anything. The other arm is positioned near the body, but there is no visible barre in the image. The scene is limited to the dancer on a notebook cover, and no barre is present. Therefore, the arm is not shown gripping a barre, and the positioning does not reflect a typical barre exercise setup. The absence of a barre and the lack of grip on any object mean this detail is inaccurate.",

      "question": "Is the dancer facing to the right side of the image, with her body in a side profile view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is illustrated in a side-facing orientation, with her head turned toward the right side of the frame. Her body is presented in a clear lateral profile, showing the outline of her torso, legs, and arms from the side. This is consistent with a side profile view commonly used in ballet illustrations to emphasize line and form. The direction of her gaze and the alignment of her features confirm she is facing right. Even though the style is geometric, the spatial arrangement supports this interpretation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leotard is composed of various geometric shapes, including triangles and polygons. While the back of the leotard is visible, there is no distinct linear feature or dark line running vertically down the center that would indicate a seam. In realistic ballet leotards, a central back seam is common, but in this stylized representation, such details are omitted or integrated into the abstract pattern. The design does not include a clear seam, and no visual cue suggests its presence. Therefore, based on the image content and artistic style, there is no visible seam.",
