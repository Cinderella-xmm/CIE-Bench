      "question": "Does each character still carry or interact with travel-related luggage such as suitcases or backpacks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are stylized in a Chibi (cute, exaggerated cartoon) art style. Despite the stylistic simplification, each character is depicted with travel-related items. For example, several characters have backpacks, and some are holding or standing next to suitcases. One character even has a suitcase with wheels visible, and another is holding a map, which is often associated with travel. These visual cues, combined with common knowledge about travel accessories, confirm that all characters are interacting with travel-related luggage. The presence of these items aligns with typical travel scenarios, reinforcing the interpretation.",

      "question": "Are the characters still wearing travel-appropriate attire, such as jackets and jeans?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are drawn in a simplified Chibi style, but their clothing choices reflect travel-appropriate attire. Most characters are wearing jackets, hats, and pants—commonly seen in travelers' outfits for comfort and weather protection. For instance, one character wears a green cap and jacket, another a straw hat with a red sweater, and others wear long-sleeved shirts and coats. While the details are minimal due to the art style, the general shapes and colors suggest practical, casual clothing suitable for travel. This aligns with real-world expectations of how people dress when traveling by train or on trips.",

      "question": "Do the characters maintain postures or actions that suggest travel-related activities, such as standing in line or holding luggage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are shown in various poses that clearly suggest travel-related behaviors. Some are holding maps, indicating navigation or planning; others are holding tickets or looking out train windows, implying they are en route or waiting. Several are standing upright with luggage, mimicking the posture of travelers at a station. Even though they are not explicitly lined up, their individual actions—such as checking tickets, looking at maps, or gazing out windows—are consistent with typical traveler behavior. These actions are universally recognized as part of the travel experience, and the Chibi style preserves these behavioral cues despite simplification.",

      "question": "Are the specific types of luggage, such as suitcases and backpacks, still recognizable in their Chibi form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the exaggerated and simplified Chibi art style, the luggage types remain visually distinguishable. Backpacks are identifiable by their shape and straps over the shoulders, while suitcases are represented with rectangular forms and handles, some even showing wheels. For example, one character carries a red backpack, another has a yellow suitcase with a handle, and a third holds a ticket while standing near a suitcase. These visual elements are simplified but retain enough structural features to be recognized as standard travel luggage. The use of familiar proportions and color contrasts helps maintain recognition, even in stylized form.",

      "question": "Do the characters retain enough visual detail in their Chibi form to be recognizable as the same individuals from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents characters in a highly stylized Chibi format, which abstracts facial features and body proportions significantly. While some characters may share similar clothing or accessories (like hats or backpacks), the lack of distinct facial features, consistent expressions, or unique identifiers makes it difficult to match them directly to specific individuals in Image A. In Image A, the characters are realistic, with varied appearances, ages, and clothing styles. In contrast, Image B uses generic, cute designs that prioritize charm over individuality. Therefore, although the theme and context are preserved, the characters in Image B are not individually recognizable as the same people from Image A due to the loss of personal distinguishing traits.",
