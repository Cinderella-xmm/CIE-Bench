      "question": "Is the V-shaped dual-wing silhouette of the building preserved in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top portion of the structure retains the original V-shaped dual-wing configuration of the building. The two wings extend outward from a central point at the top, forming a distinct 'V' shape that mirrors the architectural design seen in the original image. Despite the transformation into a robotic form, the upper section maintains this structural silhouette, suggesting that the editing process preserved this key architectural feature. The overall outline of the building’s upper part remains consistent with the original V-shape, even though the lower sections have been reimagined as mechanical limbs.",

      "question": "Are the floors stacked in a consistent, repeating modular pattern from bottom to top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor stacking is no longer consistent or modular. While the upper portion of the building still shows some resemblance to the original layered design, the lower sections have been transformed into mechanical components such as gears, circuitry, and articulated limbs. These elements disrupt any regularity in the vertical stacking of floors. Instead of uniform repetition, the structure now features irregular mechanical segments that vary in size and function, breaking the modular pattern present in the original building. This transformation suggests a deliberate artistic alteration where architectural regularity has been replaced by mechanical complexity.",

      "question": "Are the windows and balconies aligned horizontally on each floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the alignment of windows and balconies is significantly disrupted. While some remnants of horizontal alignment can be seen in the upper sections—particularly where the original building's facade is still visible—the integration of mechanical elements such as glowing panels, gears, and articulated joints distorts the horizontal continuity. For example, the windows are now embedded within metallic casings and integrated with circuit-like patterns, and balconies are either replaced or merged with robotic arms and legs. This indicates that the original horizontal alignment has been altered to accommodate the new mechanical design, making it inconsistent across the structure.",

      "question": "Are the two wings of the building symmetrically positioned relative to the central vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the symmetry of the two wings is largely preserved in the upper portion of the structure. Both wings maintain their outward extension from the central axis, forming a balanced V-shape. However, the lower sections deviate from symmetry due to the asymmetrical placement of mechanical limbs—one arm appears more developed than the other, and the legs are not perfectly mirrored. Additionally, the internal mechanical details (such as gear placements and lighting) differ between the left and right sides. While the upper architectural silhouette retains approximate symmetry, the overall structure is no longer perfectly symmetrical due to the added mechanical elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow awnings are still visible in some areas, particularly on the upper floors where the original building facade remains intact. However, many of these awnings have been modified or replaced by glowing blue panels or mechanical components. Some awnings appear to be integrated into the robot’s body, while others are absent entirely. The positions of the remaining awnings do not fully match their original layout, as they are now part of a hybrid structure that combines architectural and mechanical elements. Therefore, while traces of the original awnings exist, they are not consistently present in their original positions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distinction between window openings and balcony overhangs is blurred due to the fusion of architectural and mechanical elements. In the original building, there was a clear separation: windows were recessed, and balconies projected outward. In the edited version, however, many windows are now flush with or embedded into metallic surfaces, and balconies have been transformed into mechanical structures like arms or platforms. The boundary between these features is often obscured by circuitry, gears, and glowing panels. As a result, the clear visual separation present in the original is lost in the robotic adaptation.",
