      "question": "Is the original grayish stone texture of the pyramid’s surface retained, including visible weathering and erosion patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pyramid's surface is no longer composed of traditional grayish stone. Instead, it is covered with a scaly, blue-green reptilian-like texture resembling dragon skin, which completely alters the original material appearance. The surface now features scales and organic growths such as vines, replacing any natural stone weathering or erosion patterns. This transformation indicates that the original stone texture has been replaced by a fantastical design element. Therefore, based on visual cues and world knowledge of ancient pyramids (e.g., Mayan or Egyptian), which typically show weathered limestone or sandstone, the original texture is not retained.",

      "question": "Is the top platform of the pyramid preserved as a flat, rectangular structure with defined edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the pyramid has transformed into a dragon's head, complete with glowing eyes, fangs, and horns. The once-flat rectangular platform is now part of a creature's facial structure, with curved contours and biological features replacing geometric lines. The shape is no longer rectangular or flat but instead follows the anatomy of a mythical beast. This contrasts sharply with typical pyramid architecture where the summit is a small temple or altar with sharp edges. Thus, the original structural form of the top platform is not preserved.",

      "question": "Does the central staircase remain aligned along the front face of the pyramid, extending from the top temple to the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central staircase is absent. Instead of a clear set of steps leading up the front face, the structure integrates into the body of a dragon-like creature. The entrance appears to be at ground level, flanked by large claws and vine-covered limbs, suggesting no vertical access via stairs. The architectural symmetry and functional staircase seen in real-world pyramids (like El Castillo at Chichen Itza) are entirely replaced by a fantasy design. Hence, the central staircase does not remain aligned or present.",

      "question": "Are there exactly nine distinct tiers visible in the pyramid’s structure, decreasing in size from bottom to top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stepped tiered structure typical of Mesoamerican pyramids is not preserved. While the overall shape suggests a pyramidal form, the sides are now covered with scaled skin and organic forms, making individual tiers indistinct. The clear, repetitive horizontal layers that define each step are obscured by the dragon-like overlay. Moreover, the number of tiers cannot be accurately counted due to the fusion of architectural and biological elements. In contrast, real pyramids like those at Tikal or Teotihuacan often have multiple visible tiers (typically 9–10), but here they are not discernible. Therefore, the presence of exactly nine tiers is not confirmed.",

      "question": "Are patches of moss and small vegetation visible along the edges and steps of the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, in Image B, there are visible patches of green moss and creeping vines growing over the structure, particularly around the dragon’s head and along its limbs. These plant elements appear integrated into the design, suggesting long-term exposure to a humid jungle environment. The presence of such vegetation aligns with common depictions of ancient ruins overgrown by nature. Although the 'steps' are no longer clearly defined, the organic growths resemble moss and vines commonly found on aged stone structures in tropical regions. Thus, while the context is fantastical, the visual evidence supports the presence of moss and vegetation.",

      "question": "Is the shadow cast by the pyramid positioned to the lower right, consistent with sunlight coming from the upper left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting direction can be inferred from the highlights and shadows. The illuminated areas are on the upper-left side of the pyramid, while the darker, shaded regions extend toward the lower-right. This pattern indicates that the light source is coming from the upper left, casting shadows to the lower right. This is consistent with how shadows behave under directional sunlight. The surrounding trees also show similar shading, reinforcing this conclusion. Therefore, the shadow placement is physically plausible and matches expected lighting behavior.",

      "question": "Is the pyramid located in the center of a dense tropical jungle, with trees surrounding it on all sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pyramid is indeed situated within a lush, densely forested area. The surrounding environment is filled with tall, thick green trees and foliage typical of a tropical rainforest. The canopy extends around the entire structure, indicating that it is centrally located within the jungle. There are no open spaces or cleared areas visible beyond the immediate vicinity of the pyramid. This setting is consistent with the idea of an ancient ruin hidden deep within a jungle, as seen in real-world sites like Palenque or Angkor Wat. Thus, the location description holds true.",

      "question": "Is the top platform of the pyramid covered with dry soil and patches of moss, indicating natural overgrowth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top platform has been transformed into a dragon’s head, which includes glowing eyes and a mouth with fangs. There is no visible dry soil or moss covering this area; instead, the surface is made of scaly, textured skin. While some vines wrap around the head, the surface is not earthy or vegetative in the way described. The presence of dry soil and moss would suggest natural decay and environmental encroachment, but here the top is part of a fantastical creature rather than a naturally overgrown ruin. Therefore, the condition described does not match what is observed.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no vehicles visible near the base of the pyramid. Instead, the foreground shows a paved area with intricate carvings and glowing floral-like lights. The surrounding ground is covered in grass and jungle plants, but no cars or modern transportation are present. In contrast, Image A (the original) might show such vehicles, but in this edited version, they have been removed or replaced by fantasy elements. Since the question pertains only to Image B, and no vehicles are seen, the answer must reflect their absence.",
