      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is shown in a dynamic pose with both feet off the ground and the skateboard separated from his feet, indicating that he is airborne. The position of the body—bent knees, extended arms for balance, and the upward trajectory—suggests that he is in the middle of a trick, such as an ollie or flip trick. The fact that the skateboard is below him and slightly rotated supports the idea that it is in motion, consistent with being mid-trick. This visual evidence aligns with common skateboarding physics where the rider becomes airborne during maneuvers. Therefore, based on the posture and separation from the board, it is clear the skater is mid-air.",

      "question": "Does the skater's hat still feature the geometric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skater is wearing a knit beanie in Image B, and upon close inspection, the hat displays a distinct pattern consisting of repeating shapes and possibly animal motifs (such as reindeer), along with text. These elements are characteristic of a geometric or Nordic-style design commonly found on winter hats. The pattern remains visible despite the angle and lighting, confirming its presence. There is no indication of any alteration or obscuring of the pattern, so the geometric design is preserved.",

      "question": "Is the skateboard positioned below the skater in mid-flip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is located beneath the skater but appears to be rotating horizontally, with its underside facing upward. The wheels are visible, and the board is angled such that it seems to be flipping or spinning. Given the skater’s elevated position and the orientation of the board, this suggests the skateboard is undergoing a flip maneuver (e.g., kickflip or heelflip). The spatial relationship between the skater and the board—where the board is below and rotating—confirms that it is in the process of a flip. This aligns with typical skateboarding tricks involving aerial rotation of the board.",

      "question": "Are the building facades and tree branches visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B clearly shows multiple architectural structures, including tall buildings with numerous windows and balconies, which are characteristic of urban residential or commercial buildings. Additionally, leafless tree branches are visible, crisscrossing the sky and partially framing the scene. These elements suggest the photo was taken in a city park or public space during late autumn or winter. The visibility of these features is not obstructed, and they contribute to the depth and context of the image. Thus, both building facades and tree branches are present and discernible in the background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The upper portion of Image B reveals a bright, unobstructed blue sky, particularly visible through the gaps between the tree branches and behind the buildings. There are no clouds or haze, and the lighting suggests a sunny day. The contrast between the dark silhouettes of the trees and the vibrant blue sky enhances the clarity of the sky’s color. This indicates that the weather conditions at the time were clear, and the sky is indeed visible and blue.",
