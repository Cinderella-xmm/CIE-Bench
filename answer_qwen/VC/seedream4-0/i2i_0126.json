      "question": "Are there two individuals seated at a desk working on computers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two individuals seated at a desk, each in front of a computer monitor. Both are actively engaged with their keyboards, suggesting they are working. The visual cues—such as the positioning of their hands on the keyboards and their orientation toward the screens—support the conclusion that they are using computers. This setup is consistent with typical office or remote work environments where individuals use desktop computers. Therefore, based on the visual information and common understanding of workplace behavior, it is clear that both individuals are seated at a desk working on computers.",

      "question": "Is the desk supported by chairs on both sides, and are both individuals seated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desk is positioned centrally, and there are two office chairs—one on each side of the desk. Both individuals are seated in these chairs, facing their respective monitors. The chairs appear to be standard rolling office chairs, which are commonly used in workspaces. The presence of one chair per person, along with both individuals being seated, confirms that the desk is supported by chairs on both sides and that both individuals are seated. This configuration aligns with typical ergonomic setups in professional environments.",

      "question": "Are there two framed portraits hanging on the wall behind the individual on the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, behind the individual on the left (the woman), there are two framed portraits visible on the wall. One frame is smaller and contains a portrait of a person wearing an orange shirt, while the larger frame next to it contains a portrait of a man in a suit. These frames are mounted on the wall and positioned directly behind her, indicating they are part of the room's decor. The arrangement matches common interior design practices where personal or professional photos are displayed. Thus, the presence of two framed portraits behind the individual on the left is confirmed by direct visual evidence.",

      "question": "Are there potted plants placed on either side of the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a potted plant on the left side of the desk, near the woman, and another potted plant on the right side, near the man. Both plants are in terracotta pots and have green foliage, contributing to a balanced and aesthetically pleasing workspace. The placement of one plant on each side of the desk creates symmetry and is a common decorative choice in modern office settings. Therefore, based on the visual layout, potted plants are indeed present on either side of the desk.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both individuals are dressed similarly. The woman on the left is wearing an orange sweater over a white collared shirt and black pants. The man on the right is also wearing an orange sweater over a white collared shirt and black pants. Their attire is consistent with professional or business-casual dress codes often seen in office environments. The matching outfits suggest a coordinated appearance, possibly for branding or uniformity purposes. Based on the visual details of clothing color and layering, both individuals meet the description provided in the question.",
