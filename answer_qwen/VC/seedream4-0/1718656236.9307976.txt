    "Question": "Q1: Does the subject retain the original facial structure, including the shape of the eyes, nose, and lips?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's facial features are clearly visible and consistent with typical human proportions. The eyes are almond-shaped with defined eyeliner, the nose is straight and well-proportioned, and the lips are full and symmetrical. These features align with standard anatomical structures and appear unchanged from a natural human face. There is no distortion or alteration in the facial geometry that would suggest modification. Comparing this to Image A, the facial structure remains identical—eyes, nose, and lips are preserved in both images. This consistency indicates that the facial structure has not been altered between the two images. Therefore, based on visual analysis and common knowledge of human anatomy, the facial structure is retained.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the earrings still present and attached to the earlobes on both sides of the head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both ears are visible, and each displays a teardrop-shaped earring hanging from the earlobe. The earrings are gold-colored and feature intricate detailing, consistent with ancient or ceremonial jewelry. They are securely attached and hang naturally, indicating they are present and properly positioned. In Image A, the same earrings are visible, confirming their presence in both images. The design and placement are nearly identical, suggesting no changes were made to the earrings between the two versions. Thus, based on visual evidence and symmetry, the earrings remain attached to both earlobes.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are there two braids extending from the sides of the head, hanging over the shoulders?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, two distinct braids are visible, originating from the sides of the head and cascading down over the shoulders. These braids are neatly woven and integrated into the overall hairstyle, which complements the elaborate headdress. The texture and direction of the braids are consistent with traditional styling seen in historical or cultural attire. In Image A, the same braids are present, though slightly less detailed due to lighting differences. Both images show the braids extending symmetrically, confirming their presence in both versions. Therefore, based on visual continuity and common knowledge of hairstyling, the braids are indeed present.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the necklace positioned around the neck, with a central pendant resting on the chest?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject wears multiple layered necklaces. The uppermost layer consists of gold beads forming a choker-like structure, while below it, a turquoise beaded necklace is visible. At the center of these layers, a circular golden pendant hangs prominently on the chest. The positioning is centered and symmetrical, indicating deliberate placement. In Image A, a similar necklace is present, but it lacks the turquoise beads and has a simpler design. However, the central pendant is still visible in both images, confirming its consistent placement. Based on visual analysis and understanding of jewelry design, the necklace is correctly positioned around the neck with the pendant resting on the chest.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the garment remain sleeveless with wide shoulder straps extending from the shoulders?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the garment is clearly sleeveless, with wide, decorative shoulder straps extending from the top of the shoulders. These straps are adorned with geometric patterns and appear to be made of woven material with metallic accents. The design is consistent with ancient or ceremonial attire, such as that worn by rulers or deities in historical cultures. In Image A, the same garment style is visible, though the coloration and texture differ slightly due to lighting. Both images confirm the sleeveless nature and the presence of wide shoulder straps. Therefore, based on visual comparison and knowledge of clothing design, the garment retains its original form.",

Her facial expression is calm and composed, with no significant smile or frown, indicating neutrality. The eyes are open and focused, creating a sense of direct engagement with the viewer. In Image A, the same frontal orientation and neutral expression are present, confirming consistency between the two images.

    "Question": "Q7: Is the background a neutral, softly blurred tone without any distinct objects or patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is uniformly toned in a muted brownish-gray hue. It is out of focus, with no discernible shapes, textures, or objects, creating a soft blur that emphasizes the subject. This type of background is commonly used in studio portraits to avoid distractions. In Image A, the background is similarly neutral and blurred, though slightly darker in tone. Both images use a plain backdrop to keep attention on the subject. Based on visual analysis and photographic principles, the background meets the criteria of being neutral and softly blurred.",
