      "question": "Does the edited image retain the intricate wrought-iron lattice structure of both Eiffel Towers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two Eiffel Towers are depicted inside a snow globe, and their structural details are visible despite the scale and artistic stylization. The towers maintain the characteristic latticework that defines the real Eiffel Tower's design—this includes the crisscrossing iron beams and open framework typical of Gustave Eiffel's original engineering. Although the towers are miniaturized and rendered in a slightly stylized manner to fit within the snow globe, the visual cues such as the repeating geometric patterns and open truss design confirm the presence of the intricate wrought-iron lattice. This is consistent with world knowledge about the Eiffel Tower’s construction. Therefore, the lattice structure is preserved in the representation.",

      "question": "Are both towers supported by a triangular base composed of four distinct pillars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Eiffel Tower in reality is supported by four massive arched legs that form a square base, converging at the ground level and spreading outward to support the structure. In Image B, the towers are shown in miniature form within a snow globe. Despite the scaling down, the base of each tower appears to maintain the iconic four-legged foundation, forming a triangular-like shape when viewed from the front. The visual evidence shows four distinct supports extending from the ground up to the first level of the tower, consistent with the actual architectural design. Thus, even in this stylized and scaled-down depiction, the foundational structure is accurately represented.",

      "question": "Is there a clearly defined archway beneath each tower through which the path passes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the real Eiffel Tower, there is a large central archway at the base, allowing access underneath the structure. In Image B, although the scene is highly stylized and contained within a snow globe, the towers still feature an open space beneath them, resembling the main archway. This archway is visible between the legs of each tower, and it appears to be part of the landscape layout, suggesting a pathway or open passage beneath. Given that the snow globe contains a detailed model, including surrounding trees and pathways, the inclusion of this archway aligns with the known design of the Eiffel Tower. Therefore, the archway is present and clearly defined.",

      "question": "Are there exactly two Eiffel Towers present in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a snow globe containing a miniature Parisian scene. Within the upper portion of the globe, two identical structures resembling the Eiffel Tower are clearly visible. These towers are symmetrically placed and mirror each other in height, shape, and design. There are no additional towers in the scene. The background includes other buildings like Notre-Dame, but only two Eiffel Tower replicas are present. This matches the visual information and aligns with the intended artistic representation. Therefore, the count is accurate.",

      "question": "Does each tower have a pointed spire at its apex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Eiffel Tower is famously topped with a sharp, pointed spire, which serves both aesthetic and functional purposes (originally for telecommunication antennas). In Image B, both towers are shown with a clear, slender spire at their highest point. This spire is consistent in shape and placement with the real Eiffel Tower’s summit. Even though the towers are scaled down and stylized, the pointed tip remains intact and visually distinct. This detail is preserved in the miniature model, confirming that each tower has a pointed spire.",

      "question": "Are there three distinct horizontal platform levels visible along the height of each tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The real Eiffel Tower has three main observation levels: the first, second, and third floors, each marked by horizontal platforms. In Image B, due to the scale and artistic rendering, the details are somewhat simplified. However, upon close inspection, three distinct horizontal bands can be observed along the height of each tower. These correspond to the base platform, the mid-level platform, and the top platform just below the spire. While not as sharply defined as in real life, these levels are recognizable in the miniature version, especially given the context of the snow globe’s detailed craftsmanship. Therefore, the three-tiered structure is preserved.",
