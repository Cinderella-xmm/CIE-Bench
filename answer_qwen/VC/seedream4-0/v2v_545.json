      "question": "Does the sparrow retain its distinct brown, white, and black feather patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow displays a clear coloration pattern consistent with typical house sparrows. The head features a reddish-brown cap, a white cheek patch, and a black bib-like marking on the throat and upper chest, which are characteristic of male house sparrows. The back and wings show streaked brown feathers with darker markings, while the underbelly is light gray to white. These color patterns align with known biological traits of sparrows. Although the rendering style in Image B appears more stylized or cartoonish, the core feather patterns—brown, white, and black—are still present and recognizable. This suggests that despite artistic interpretation, the essential visual identity of the bird’s plumage is preserved.",

      "question": "Is the sparrow's beak shape and size consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow has a short, conical beak that is orange in color, which is typical for sparrows. However, compared to the original image (Image A), where the beak is dark gray and proportionally smaller and more naturalistic, the beak in Image B is noticeably larger and more exaggerated in shape. It also appears slightly curved upward, giving it an animated or anthropomorphic quality. This deviation from realistic proportions indicates that the beak has been altered for stylistic purposes, making it inconsistent with the original image’s naturalistic representation. Therefore, based on visual comparison and biological accuracy, the beak does not match the original in both size and shape.",

      "question": "Is the sparrow still perched on the top rail of the chair in the same upright posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow is positioned on the top horizontal rail of the wooden chair, just as in Image A. Its body is oriented upright, facing slightly to the right, with its head turned forward, maintaining a similar stance to the original. There is no indication of movement or change in orientation—its feet are placed firmly on the rail, and its posture remains balanced and static. While the overall rendering style is more cartoonish, the spatial positioning and posture relative to the chair are consistent with the original image. Thus, despite stylistic differences, the physical placement and posture remain unchanged.",

      "question": "Does the chair retain its simple design with vertical slats and horizontal rails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chair in Image B maintains the same structural elements as seen in Image A: a rectangular backrest composed of two vertical posts connected by a top and bottom horizontal rail, with three evenly spaced vertical slats in between. The wood grain texture and color are consistent, suggesting continuity in design. Although the lighting and shading in Image B give the chair a smoother, more polished appearance, possibly due to digital rendering, the fundamental geometric structure and layout of the chair have not changed. Therefore, the chair retains its simple, traditional design.",

      "question": "Are the sparrow's feet visibly gripping the chair's top rail as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow’s feet are clearly shown wrapping around the top rail of the chair, with individual toes visible and splayed outward in a natural grasping motion. The claws appear sharp and are positioned to grip the wood surface, mirroring the biomechanics of real birds perching. This is consistent with the original image (Image A), where the feet are similarly engaged in holding onto the rail. Despite the stylized rendering in Image B, the functional anatomy of the feet—such as toe curvature and claw placement—is preserved, indicating that the bird is still depicted as actively gripping the rail. Thus, the visual evidence supports that the feet are gripping the chair in the same manner as before.",
