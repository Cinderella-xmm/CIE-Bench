      "question": "Is the stylized \"P\" logo with a cart-like shape and circular wheel present on the surface of both tarts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tart is depicted in an animated, whimsical style set in a forest environment. The surface of the tart features a bright yellow top layer with a cute, cartoonish face drawn on it—consisting of two round eyes and a smiling mouth. There is no visible stylized 'P' logo resembling a cart with a wheel. Instead, the design is anthropomorphized with facial features, which is inconsistent with the branding seen in real-world Pablo cheese tarts. Based on visual analysis, the logo described in the question is absent. This contrasts with typical branding practices where such logos are often burned or printed onto the surface for brand recognition. However, in this artistic rendering, the focus is on charm rather than branding.",

      "question": "Is the word \"PABLO\" written in uppercase letters beneath the logo on both tarts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no text visible on the surface of the tart. The yellow top layer has a cheerful cartoon face instead of any lettering. The word 'PABLO' is not present anywhere on the tart’s surface. In contrast, real Pablo cheese tarts typically feature the brand name 'PABLO' printed or branded below the logo. Since Image B is an artistic, fantasy-style illustration, it omits realistic branding elements in favor of a playful design. Therefore, the absence of the word 'PABLO' is consistent with the creative intent of the image.",

      "question": "Does the top surface of each tart display a bright yellow layer covering most of the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the top surface of the tart in Image B is dominated by a bright yellow layer, which is characteristic of Pablo cheese tarts. This yellow layer appears smooth and glossy, mimicking the caramelized top that forms during baking. Even though the image is stylized, the yellow coloration is consistent with the actual appearance of the product. The yellow layer covers nearly the entire surface, leaving only the crust exposed around the edges. This matches the real-world product's appearance, albeit rendered in a more exaggerated, illustrative manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible white creamy filling beneath the yellow top layer in both tarts, especially in the sliced portion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tart is shown whole and intact, with no visible slice or cross-section. While the yellow top layer is clearly defined, there is no exposure of the internal structure. The white creamy filling, which is a hallmark of Pablo cheese tarts, is not visible because the tart has not been cut. Unlike in Image A, where a sliced portion reveals the creamy interior, Image B presents a complete tart without any cutaway. Thus, the internal filling cannot be observed in this image.",

      "question": "Does the crust of both tarts exhibit a golden-brown color with a flaky, uneven edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crust of the tart in Image B is depicted as golden-brown, consistent with baked pastry. It has a slightly textured, ruffled edge that suggests a flaky, hand-crafted appearance. While the rendering is stylized, the color and form align with the typical look of a Pablo cheese tart crust. The unevenness of the edge is preserved in the artistic interpretation, indicating attention to detail in mimicking real-world textures. Therefore, despite the cartoonish style, the crust visually matches the description.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the rear tart partially sliced to reveal the internal cross-section of the filling and crust?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only one tart visible, and it is whole and uncut. There is no indication of a second tart, nor is there any sliced portion revealing the internal layers. The image shows a single, intact tart placed on a path in a forest setting. In contrast, Image A features two tarts, one of which is sliced to expose the interior. Since Image B lacks any cut or cross-sectional view, the answer must be based solely on its content, which does not include a sliced tart.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the whole tart positioned in front of the partially sliced tart, with the latter slightly elevated and angled toward the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains only one tart, positioned centrally on a forest path. There is no second tart, let alone a partially sliced one. The concept of spatial arrangement between two tarts does not apply here, as only a single tart is present. This differs significantly from Image A, where two tarts are arranged with one in front and the other behind. In Image B, the composition focuses on a singular, charming scene without layered positioning. Therefore, the described arrangement is not present.",
