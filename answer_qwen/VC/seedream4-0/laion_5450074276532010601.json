      "question": "Is the \"Schildkröt\" brand name visible on the ball box and/or paddle surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual content is a stylized, cartoonish illustration titled 'Ping Pong Adventure'. The image features two anthropomorphic ping pong paddles emerging from a treasure chest, set against a tropical, pirate-themed background. There is no realistic depiction of a product box or actual paddles with branding details. The 'Schildkröt' brand name, which appears in Image A on the ball box and paddle surface, is not present in this artistic rendition. Instead, the paddles are cartoon characters without any visible text or logos. Therefore, based on the visual cues in Image B alone, the brand name is not visible.",

      "question": "Are the paddles clearly depicted with one red rubber surface and one blue rubber surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two paddles are illustrated as animated characters. One has a red rubber surface and is wearing a red helmet, while the other has a blue rubber surface and is wearing a blue cap. These colors are consistent with typical table tennis paddle rubbers—red and black (or blue) being standard. Although the depiction is cartoonish, the color distinction between the two paddles is clear and accurate to real-world conventions. Thus, the visual representation confirms that one paddle has a red surface and the other a blue surface.",

      "question": "Is there a diamond-shaped logo present on the handle of each paddle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paddles are stylized cartoon characters with exaggerated features such as faces, arms, and hats. While the handles are visible, they lack detailed markings or logos. In particular, there is no indication of a diamond-shaped logo on either paddle’s handle. This contrasts with Image A, where such a logo is present on the actual paddle handles. Since Image B is an artistic interpretation, it omits fine details like logos for stylistic reasons. Therefore, based on the visual information in Image B, the diamond-shaped logo is not present.",

      "question": "Are exactly two paddles included in the set?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two distinct cartoon paddles emerging from a treasure chest. Each paddle has a unique color scheme and accessories (one red with a helmet, one blue with a cap), suggesting they represent individual items in a set. There are no additional paddles visible. The context of the illustration—a playful 'adventure' theme—implies a complete, balanced pair for gameplay. Given that only two paddles are shown and no others are implied, it is reasonable to conclude that exactly two paddles are included in the depicted set.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box is a treasure chest with a golden, glittery appearance and no visible rope handle. It is closed and does not show any attachment points or ropes on its sides. This differs from Image A, where a cardboard box has a rope handle on the left side. However, since Image B is a fictional, thematic illustration, it does not include practical design elements like carrying handles. Therefore, based solely on the visual content of Image B, there is no rope handle visible.",

      "question": "Is there a horizontal partition inside the box that separates and holds the paddles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box is a treasure chest, and its interior is not visible. The paddles appear to be emerging from the top of the chest, but there is no indication of internal compartments or partitions. In contrast, Image A shows a real box with a horizontal divider holding the paddles in place. However, Image B is a creative rendering focused on storytelling rather than functional design, so internal structural details like partitions are omitted. Thus, based on the visual evidence in Image B, no horizontal partition is visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box is a treasure chest, which is typically arched or rounded at the top rather than rectangular. It has a curved lid that appears to be hinged, but the overall shape is not rectangular—it is more dome-like and ornate. This contrasts with Image A, where the box is clearly rectangular with a flat, hinged lid. The treasure chest in Image B is designed for aesthetic appeal, not practical storage, and thus deviates from the rectangular form. Therefore, based on the visual cues in Image B, the box does not have a rectangular shape with a hinged lid that opens upward.",
