    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the trident with exactly three sharp, symmetrical prongs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trident is clearly visible and held by the figure. Upon close inspection, the trident has three prongs that are sharp and appear symmetrical in shape and spacing. This aligns with the typical design of Aquaman's trident as seen in the DC Universe, which features three distinct prongs. The visual cues confirm that the trident maintains its iconic form without any additional or missing prongs. There is no distortion or alteration to the number or symmetry of the prongs, indicating consistency with the original design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the geometric patterns (triangular and diamond-shaped plates) clearly visible and intact across the chest, arms, and legs of the armor?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the armor worn by the figure is highly detailed and rendered in a metallic blue finish. The chest plate, arm guards, and leg armor display intricate patterns composed of triangular and diamond-shaped plates, consistent with Aquaman's signature suit design. These patterns are clearly defined and uniformly distributed across the body, suggesting careful preservation of the original design elements. The lighting enhances the texture, making the geometric shapes stand out. Compared to Image A, where the black-and-white contrast emphasizes these patterns, Image B retains their clarity in color, confirming their visibility and integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the hair long, wavy, and flowing over the shoulders, matching the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s hair is visibly long, wavy, and extends past the shoulders, cascading down naturally. The style matches the portrayal of Aquaman in Zack Snyder's Justice League, where his hair is styled to reflect both strength and regality. The texture appears realistic, with strands flowing dynamically, consistent with the character’s appearance in the film. Comparing this to Image A, the hair is similarly styled, though the monochrome format makes it harder to assess texture; however, the length and flow remain consistent. Therefore, the edited image preserves the original hair characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the full beard present and clearly visible on the face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character has a full, well-defined beard that covers the lower half of the face, extending from the jawline to the chin. The beard is thick and neatly groomed, consistent with Aquaman’s appearance in the film. It is clearly visible despite the lighting and angle, and its presence adds to the character’s imposing look. In comparison to Image A, the beard is also prominent, though the grayscale tones may slightly reduce its texture detail. However, in Image B, the color and lighting enhance the visibility of the beard, confirming its presence and clarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the right hand positioned firmly on the shaft of the trident, gripping it in a dominant stance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's right hand is placed firmly around the shaft of the trident, with fingers wrapped tightly around it, suggesting a strong, dominant grip. The positioning of the hand indicates control and authority, consistent with Aquaman’s heroic persona. The angle of the hand and the way it interacts with the trident shaft aligns with the original depiction in Image A, where the same pose is maintained. The editing process does not alter the hand placement, preserving the intended stance. Thus, the grip remains accurate and purposeful.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the figure maintain an upright, heroic stance with the head turned to the left side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure stands tall and upright, exuding a sense of confidence and heroism. The posture is straight, with the shoulders back and the body facing forward, while the head is turned slightly to the left, looking off into the distance. This pose mirrors the heroic stance seen in Image A, where the same orientation is preserved. The turn of the head adds a dynamic element to the composition, enhancing the dramatic effect. The editing process has not altered the overall posture or head direction, maintaining consistency with the original image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
