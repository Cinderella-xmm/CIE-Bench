      "question": "Are the eyes of the figure still bright blue with clearly visible irises?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is a stylized chibi-style collectible figurine. The eyes are large, round, and cartoonish in design, typical of this art style. They are indeed blue in color, but they lack detailed irises and pupils as seen in realistic depictions. Instead, they have a simplified, flat appearance common in chibi figures. This contrasts with realistic or highly detailed character representations where irises and pupils are clearly defined. Therefore, while the color is blue, the irises are not clearly visible due to the artistic simplification.",

      "question": "Is the facial texture still characterized by deep, horizontal and vertical wrinkles and a cracked, stone-like pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a chibi-style figurine with smooth, rounded facial features. There are no deep wrinkles or cracked textures present. Instead, the face has a soft, plastic-like surface typical of such collectibles. In contrast, Image A displays a highly detailed, realistic mask with pronounced wrinkles and a stone-like texture, resembling an ancient or mythical being. The transformation from Image A to Image B involves a shift from realism to stylization, eliminating intricate textures. Thus, the deep, stone-like wrinkles are absent in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the figure still shown with long, white hair extending past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure has long, flowing white hair that extends past the shoulders, consistent with the original depiction in Image A. However, the style differs: in Image A, the hair appears more natural and textured, possibly part of a costume or mask, while in Image B, it is sculpted and stylized, fitting the chibi aesthetic. Despite the stylistic differences, the length and color remain similar. The hair flows down and over the shoulders, maintaining continuity in this feature.",

      "question": "Does the figure still have a full, white beard covering the lower face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure has a small, stylized goatee or mustache, but it does not extend into a full beard. It is minimal and cartoonish, lacking the dense, full coverage seen in Image A. In Image A, the beard is thick and prominent, contributing to the aged, mystical appearance. The chibi version in Image B simplifies facial hair for aesthetic balance, reducing it to a tiny tuft. Therefore, while there is some facial hair, it is not a full beard.",

      "question": "Are the facial contours, including the jawline and cheekbones, still clearly defined and consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial structure is significantly altered due to the chibi art style. The jawline and cheekbones are softened and rounded, lacking the sharp definition seen in Image A. In Image A, the facial contours are exaggerated and angular, emphasizing age and texture. In contrast, Image B prioritizes cuteness and simplicity, resulting in a less defined, more childlike face. Thus, the facial contours are not consistent with the original.",

      "question": "Is the neck still visibly defined and structured, showing a clear transition from head to torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neck is short and stubby, typical of chibi-style figures, which exaggerate the head-to-body ratio. While there is a visible transition from head to torso, it is not anatomically accurate or structured like in Image A. In Image A, the neck appears longer and more defined, contributing to the realistic, aged look. In Image B, the neck is minimized for stylistic purposes. Therefore, although there is a transition, it is not clearly defined or structured in a realistic way.",
