      "question": "Is the wooden surface with visible grain patterns and warm brown tones present and unaltered in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden surface beneath the feather pendants is clearly visible and exhibits a consistent grain pattern with warm brown tones. The texture appears natural, with linear striations typical of wood grain, and the coloration ranges from light to dark brown, suggesting a realistic wooden material. There are no signs of digital distortion, such as unnatural smoothing or excessive sharpening, that would indicate alteration. The lighting enhances the depth of the grain without distorting it. Based on visual cues and common knowledge about wood textures, this surface remains consistent with an unaltered natural wooden background. Comparing to Image A, the same grain pattern and tone are preserved, indicating no changes to the wooden surface itself.",

      "question": "Are the two feather pendants positioned such that one is in the foreground and the other is partially overlapped behind it, maintaining the original diagonal alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two feather-shaped pendants are arranged diagonally across the frame, with the lower-left pendant appearing closer to the viewer and the upper-right one partially obscured behind it. This overlapping creates a sense of depth and layering. The diagonal alignment is preserved from Image A, where the same positioning was observed. The spatial relationship between the two pendants—foreground and background—is maintained, even though the visual content of the pendants has been dramatically altered (e.g., glowing effects). Despite these changes, their physical placement relative to each other remains unchanged. Thus, the arrangement is consistent with the original composition.",

      "question": "Do the pendants cast soft, consistent shadows beneath them on the wooden surface, indicating overhead lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pendants appear to emit a bright, fiery glow, which dominates the visual field. While there are subtle gradients beneath the pendants that suggest some form of shadowing, they are not soft or consistent. Instead, the intense luminosity from the glowing elements interferes with natural shadow formation, resulting in a lack of defined, realistic shadows. In contrast, Image A shows clear, soft shadows beneath the pendants due to overhead lighting, which adds depth and realism. The absence of such shadows in Image B suggests that the lighting has been digitally enhanced or replaced with a radiant effect, disrupting the natural shadow dynamics. Therefore, the shadowing is inconsistent with natural overhead lighting.",

      "question": "Are the pendants aligned diagonally across the frame, extending from the lower-left toward the upper-right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two feather pendants follow a clear diagonal trajectory, starting from the lower-left corner and extending toward the upper-right. This orientation matches the layout seen in Image A, where the same diagonal alignment was present. Even though the appearance of the pendants has changed—from leather and turquoise beads to glowing, fiery feathers—their spatial positioning within the frame remains identical. The diagonal arrangement contributes to visual balance and flow, and this compositional choice has been preserved in the edit. Thus, the alignment is consistent with the original image.",

      "question": "Does the wooden surface retain its natural grain texture, including variations in tone and minor imperfections, without digital smoothing or enhancement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden surface in Image B displays visible grain patterns, tonal variations, and subtle imperfections such as slight knots and irregularities in texture. These features are consistent with natural wood and are comparable to those in Image A. There is no evidence of digital smoothing, uniform filtering, or artificial enhancement that would homogenize the surface. The lighting accentuates the grain without distorting it, and the overall texture appears authentic. Given that the editing primarily affects the pendants rather than the background, the wooden surface remains unaltered in terms of texture and detail.",

      "question": "Is the edge of the leather feather clearly defined against the wooden surface, showing a slight separation and shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the feather pendants are highly stylized and illuminated with a glowing, fiery effect. As a result, the boundaries between the pendants and the wooden surface are less distinct compared to Image A. In the original image, the leather feather had a clearly defined edge with a subtle shadow indicating separation from the wood. However, in the edited version, the glow bleeds into the surrounding area, blurring the edge and eliminating the soft shadow that would normally suggest physical separation. The luminous effect overrides the natural depth cues, making the edge appear fused or merged with the background. Therefore, the definition and shadowing at the edge are compromised.",
