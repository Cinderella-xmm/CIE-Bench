    "Question": "Q1: Is the horse depicted with its original white coat and blonde mane and tail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is clearly shown with a predominantly white coat, which matches the description of an original white coat. The mane and tail appear to be a light golden or blonde color, consistent with the appearance in Image A. This is supported by visual cues such as the reflection of sunlight on the hair, highlighting its pale, almost luminous quality. Given that horses with white coats often have lighter manes and tails, this coloration is anatomically and visually plausible. There are no signs of discoloration or artificial alterations to the coat or hair, suggesting the horse retains its original coloring. Comparing with Image A, the same white coat and blonde mane/tail are present, confirming consistency. Therefore, based on both visual analysis and biological plausibility, the horse maintains its original coat and mane/tail color.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the horse retain its posture of being in mid-gait?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is captured mid-air with all four legs off the ground, indicating a galloping or leaping motion. This dynamic posture is characteristic of a horse in full stride during a gait such as a canter or gallop. The positioning of the limbs—front legs extended forward and hind legs trailing behind—aligns with biomechanical principles of equine movement. The dust kicked up beneath the horse further supports the idea of rapid motion. Comparing with Image A, where the horse is also in motion but with one leg lifted (suggesting a different phase of gait), Image B shows a more elevated, airborne moment. However, both images depict the horse in active locomotion. Thus, while the exact phase of gait differs slightly, the overall posture remains consistent with being in mid-gait. The key indicator—the suspension of the body above the ground—is present, confirming the horse is in mid-gait.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the horse's original hooves visible and unchanged?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hooves are clearly visible, particularly the front hooves which are raised and well-defined against the background. They appear dark in color, consistent with natural hoof pigmentation in many white horses. There is no indication of deformation, unnatural coloring, or digital manipulation that would suggest alteration. The shape and size of the hooves match typical equine anatomy. Comparing with Image A, the hooves are similarly colored and shaped, though less illuminated due to brighter ambient lighting. In both images, the hooves maintain a consistent dark brown or black hue and structural form. No visual cues suggest modification or replacement. Therefore, based on anatomical accuracy and visual consistency across both images, the hooves remain unchanged.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the horse's body proportion consistent with its original form?",
    "explanation": "The horse in Image B exhibits a sleek, muscular build with balanced proportions between the head, neck, torso, and legs. The neck is long and arched, the chest broad, and the legs proportionate to the body size—features typical of a well-formed horse, possibly of a breed like an Arabian or Andalusian. The silhouette aligns with known equine anatomy, showing no signs of distortion such as elongated limbs or exaggerated musculature. When compared to Image A, the body structure is nearly identical: similar head-to-body ratio, leg length, and overall symmetry. The lighting in Image B enhances certain contours, but does not alter the underlying proportions. Thus, despite the change in environment and lighting, the horse’s physical dimensions remain consistent with its original form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the horse's eyes and facial expression unaltered?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse’s eyes are clearly visible and appear alert and focused, with a direct gaze toward the viewer. The facial features—including the shape of the muzzle, position of the ears, and overall expression—are consistent with those seen in Image A. The ears are pricked forward, indicating attentiveness, and there is no sign of distortion or unnatural editing around the eye region. The lighting in Image B creates shadows that accentuate the depth of the eyes, but do not alter their shape or expression. Comparing with Image A, the facial structure remains identical: same eye placement, nostril shape, and overall calm yet energetic demeanor. The expression suggests awareness and movement, which is appropriate for a horse in motion. There is no evidence of digital manipulation affecting the face. Therefore, the eyes and facial expression are unaltered.",
    "answer": "Yes"
