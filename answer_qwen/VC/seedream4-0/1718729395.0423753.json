      "question": "Is there a faint circular halo floating above the angel’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a subtle, glowing circular halo is visible above the angel's head. This halo is rendered with a soft, luminous outline that appears to float just above the crown of her head, consistent with traditional artistic depictions of divine or holy figures. The halo is not overly bright but has a delicate, ethereal glow, which aligns with common representations in religious art where halos symbolize sanctity or divinity. Based on visual cues and world knowledge of iconography, this feature is clearly present.",

      "question": "Are there large, fully extended feathered wings visible behind the figure, symmetrically positioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the angel has two large, fully extended wings that are clearly visible behind her. The wings are symmetrical in shape and size, with feathers detailed in white and gold accents, suggesting a celestial or divine nature. The positioning of the wings is balanced, extending outward from the back in a natural, anatomically plausible manner. This matches the typical representation of angelic beings in classical and religious art, where wings are often depicted as expansive and symmetrical. Therefore, based on both visual evidence and artistic conventions, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Does the angel have bright blue eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the angel’s eyes are distinctly blue, with a clear, vivid hue that stands out against her fair complexion and golden hair. The irises are well-defined, and the coloration is consistent with what is commonly described as 'bright blue' in human features. Given that eye color is a prominent facial characteristic and can be easily discerned in high-resolution digital art, the visual information confirms the presence of bright blue eyes. This observation is supported by common artistic practices in portraying angels with striking, expressive eyes to convey purity or otherworldliness.",

      "question": "Is the right hand placed near the chest or shoulder area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the angel’s right hand is raised and positioned close to her chest, with fingers gently clasped or folded near the upper torso. This gesture is typical in religious or serene portrayals, often symbolizing humility, prayer, or contemplation. The placement is clearly within the vicinity of the chest and shoulder region, not lower or away from the body. This is consistent with both visual anatomy and common poses in angelic imagery. Thus, based on the spatial positioning observed in the image, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Does the figure have long, wavy, golden-blonde hair that flows over the shoulders and back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the angel’s hair is long, flowing, and exhibits a wavy texture. The color is a rich golden-blonde, with highlights that suggest illumination from an external light source, possibly symbolic of divine radiance. The hair cascades over her shoulders and down her back, creating a dynamic and graceful appearance. This style is consistent with classical depictions of angels and heavenly beings, where long, luminous hair enhances the sense of ethereality. The visual details confirm the description provided in the question.",

      "question": "Is the figure positioned slightly turned toward the viewer, with the face angled forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the angel is oriented such that her body is slightly turned to one side (likely the left), while her face is directed more directly toward the viewer. This creates a three-quarter view of her face, with the angle allowing for depth and dimension in the portrait. Her gaze meets the viewer’s, reinforcing the sense of engagement. This pose is common in portraiture, especially in religious or mythological art, where the subject is presented with dignity and presence. The combination of body turn and forward-facing face supports the conclusion that she is positioned as described.",
