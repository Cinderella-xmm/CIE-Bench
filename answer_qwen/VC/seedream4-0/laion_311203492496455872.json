      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit jacket features a small red circular object positioned on the left lapel, consistent with the placement of an insignia or pin. The shape and color are clearly defined and match the appearance of the original insignia seen in Image A. Although the overall style of the image is stylized and geometric, the red circular element remains in the same relative position and retains its distinct form. This suggests that the insignia has been preserved in the edit, even though the surrounding elements have been transformed into a low-poly art style. Based on visual consistency and common knowledge about formal attire where such pins are typically worn, the presence of this detail is intentional and recognizable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ear is depicted on the left side of the head, maintaining a general anatomical orientation relative to the face. However, due to the low-poly, stylized rendering, the ear is simplified into angular, geometric shapes rather than a realistic representation. Despite the abstraction, the ear's position—behind the cheekbone and aligned with the head’s profile—is consistent with its natural placement. While not anatomically precise, it is clearly identifiable as an ear in the correct location. In comparison to Image A, where the ear is naturally detailed and fully visible, Image B preserves the spatial relationship but alters the form. Given that the question asks whether it is 'clearly visible' in its original anatomical position, the answer hinges on recognition rather than realism. The ear is indeed visible and placed correctly, even if stylized.",

      "question": "Is the mouth open in a natural smile showing the upper row of teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouth is rendered in a stylized, cartoonish manner with a wide, upward-curved line indicating a smile. The teeth are visible, but they are exaggerated and simplified—appearing as a bright white arc within the mouth. However, the teeth are not realistically modeled; instead, they resemble a graphic representation typical of animated characters. In contrast, in Image A, the smile is natural and subtle, with visible upper teeth that align with human anatomy. The edited version in Image B does show teeth, but they are not presented in a naturalistic way. The question asks specifically about a 'natural smile showing the upper row of teeth.' While teeth are shown, the expression is not natural due to the stylization. Therefore, although teeth are visible, the smile is not natural.",

      "question": "Is the nose retaining its original shape with a distinct bridge and rounded tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nose is represented in a geometric, low-poly style. It has a triangular structure with sharp edges and flat planes, which contrasts sharply with the smooth, curved contours of a real human nose. While there is a clear separation between the bridge and the tip, both are angular and lack the organic rounding and soft transitions seen in Image A. The original nose in Image A has a well-defined bridge and a softly rounded tip, typical of natural human anatomy. In Image B, the nose is abstracted, with no rounded tip—instead, it ends in a flat, polygonal surface. Thus, despite some structural resemblance, the nose does not retain its original shape. The transformation prioritizes artistic style over anatomical accuracy.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head is oriented such that the right side of the face is facing forward, while the left side is partially visible, indicating a turn toward the right. This matches the three-quarter profile view seen in Image A, where the subject is also looking slightly to the right. The angle of the head, jawline, and positioning of facial features (such as the eye and ear) confirm this orientation. Even though the style is highly stylized, the spatial arrangement of the head relative to the shoulders and torso supports the conclusion that the head is turned to the right. The consistency in pose between Image A and Image B reinforces this observation. Therefore, despite the artistic abstraction, the directional orientation of the head remains unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a plain, uniform light gray or off-white color with no visible textures, patterns, or objects. There are no shadows, gradients, or environmental elements that would suggest depth or context beyond the figure. This matches the background in Image A, which is also a clean, neutral backdrop. The editing process appears to have preserved the simplicity of the background, focusing attention solely on the stylized figure. The absence of any additional elements or textures confirms that the background remains uniformly off-white. This is consistent with standard photographic practices for portrait isolation and enhances the focus on the subject.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is stylized and artificial, typical of 3D renderings. Shadows are present under the chin and along the jawline, but they are sharp, angular, and geometric, reflecting the low-poly nature of the model. These shadows do not appear soft or diffused as they would under natural even frontal lighting. Instead, they follow the facets of the polygons, creating a stark contrast between light and dark areas. In contrast, Image A shows soft, gradual shading under the chin and jawline, consistent with even frontal illumination. The difference in shadow quality reflects the shift from photorealism to digital artistry. Since the shadows in Image B are hard-edged and inconsistent with natural lighting, they do not meet the criteria of being soft and natural.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt collar is depicted as part of a low-poly, geometric design. It is positioned at the base of the neck and connects seamlessly to the suit jacket, maintaining the typical alignment seen in formal wear. The collar forms a V-shape that opens appropriately, and its edges align with the neck and jacket lapels. While the style is abstracted, the structural relationship between the collar, neck, and jacket remains anatomically and stylistically consistent. In Image A, the collar is naturally folded and attached to the neck, and this connection is preserved in Image B, albeit in a stylized form. The continuity of the collar’s position and its integration with the neck and jacket indicate proper alignment, even if rendered in a non-realistic way.",
