      "question": "Is the pointed conical hat with a wide brim present on the gnome’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gnome is clearly wearing a hat that is conical in shape and has a wide brim extending outward from the base of the cone. This is consistent with traditional garden gnome designs, where the pointed hat is a defining feature. The texture and color of the hat match the rest of the gnome's body, suggesting it is part of the same sculpted piece. The visual evidence confirms the presence of both the pointed top and the wide brim.",

      "question": "Does the gnome have a full, vertically striated beard extending from the chin down to the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gnome in Image B has a long, textured beard that extends from the chin down to the chest area. The beard features vertical striations, which are typical of sculpted representations to mimic hair strands. This detail is consistent with common garden gnome aesthetics, where beards are often exaggerated and intricately carved. The length and texture align with the description provided.",

      "question": "Is the gnome in a seated position with bent knees and a forward-facing upper body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gnome in Image B is depicted in a seated posture, with knees bent upward and feet flat on the ground. The upper body is oriented forward, facing the viewer directly. This pose is typical for garden gnomes meant to be displayed in gardens or decorative settings. The positioning of the limbs and torso supports the interpretation of a seated, forward-facing figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the gnome have small, oval-shaped eyes, a broad nose, and a closed smiling mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the gnome’s face in Image B, the eyes are small and oval-shaped, set within the facial structure. The nose is broad and rounded, typical of gnome sculptures. The mouth is closed and curved upward in a subtle smile, contributing to a cheerful expression. These facial features are consistent with stylized garden gnome depictions, where exaggerated but friendly expressions are common.",

      "question": "Are the gnome’s feet shaped like round boots with visible stitching details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gnome’s feet in Image B appear to be shaped like round boots, which is characteristic of many garden gnome designs. There are visible lines and textures on the surface of the boots that resemble stitching, particularly along the seams and around the tops. These details suggest an attempt to mimic leather boot construction, enhancing the realism of the sculpture. The overall form and texture support this interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the gnome uniformly colored in a warm, sandy beige tone with textured surface variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gnome in Image B exhibits a consistent warm, sandy beige coloration across its entire body, including the hat, beard, clothing, and boots. The surface shows variations in texture—such as roughness on the hat, fine lines in the beard, and woven patterns on the basket—but these are all within the same color palette. This uniformity in tone combined with textural diversity is typical of stone or concrete garden ornaments designed to look weathered yet cohesive.",

      "question": "Is the left hand raised and positioned as if holding an object, while the right hand rests near the lower body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands of the gnome are raised and symmetrically positioned, each holding a round object (likely seed balls). Neither hand is resting near the lower body; instead, both are held up at approximately chest level. This contradicts the description in the question, which specifies one hand raised and the other resting. Therefore, the statement does not accurately reflect the positioning observed in the image.",
