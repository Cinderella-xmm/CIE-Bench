      "question": "Are the subject's eyes blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's eyes are clearly visible and have a distinct blue hue. The irises are light in color, with a cool tone that is characteristic of blue eyes. This can be determined by observing the reflection and coloration within the eye area, which contrasts with the surrounding skin tone and darker eyeliner. Blue eyes are relatively rare and often stand out in digital art due to their vividness, especially when rendered with high detail as seen here. There is no ambiguity in the color representation, and the lighting does not distort the natural appearance of the eyes.",

      "question": "Does the subject have dark wavy hair with two feather-like adornments on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B has dark, wavy hair styled in a short, voluminous cut that frames the face. However, there are no visible feather-like adornments on either side of the head. Instead, the hair appears natural without any accessories or decorative elements attached. In contrast, Image A shows feather-like adornments, but these are absent in Image B. Therefore, based solely on visual evidence from Image B, the presence of such adornments cannot be confirmed.",

      "question": "Is there a glowing golden orb centered on the chest, emitting light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's chest features a prominent mechanical device resembling a pocket watch, which is integrated into the armor. It is gold in color and emits a warm glow, suggesting illumination from within. While it is circular and centrally located, it is not an orb in the traditional sense—it is more accurately described as a clockwork mechanism with a luminous face. The glow is consistent with artificial lighting, likely from internal components, rather than a mystical or magical source. Thus, although it glows and is centered, it is not a 'golden orb' as might be interpreted in a fantasy context.",

      "question": "Is the subject facing directly forward with a neutral expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B is facing slightly to the viewer’s left, not directly forward. Her gaze is directed toward the camera, but her body orientation is angled, giving a three-quarter view. Additionally, her facial expression is serious and composed, with a slight firmness around the lips and a focused look in the eyes, which suggests determination rather than neutrality. While not overtly emotional, it leans toward intensity rather than complete neutrality. Therefore, she is not facing directly forward nor displaying a fully neutral expression.",

      "question": "Are the wings positioned symmetrically behind the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B are mechanical and steampunk in design, constructed from brass gears and metal feathers. They extend outward from the back and appear to be evenly balanced on both sides of the subject’s torso. Upon close inspection, the structure and placement of the wings show symmetry in terms of size, shape, and positioning relative to the shoulders. Both wings have identical gear arrangements and angular spread, indicating intentional symmetrical design. This symmetry is typical in artistic representations of mechanical wings to convey balance and aesthetic harmony.",
