      "question": "Is the Olympus brand name visible on the top of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera is depicted in a stylized, cartoon-like illustration. The top of the camera shows text that appears to be 'OMIIO', which is not the correct spelling of 'Olympus'. Based on visual inspection, the brand name displayed is clearly different from 'Olympus'. Additionally, 'Olympus' is a well-known camera manufacturer, and its branding typically includes the full name or logo in a distinct font. Here, the text is altered, suggesting either an artistic interpretation or a fictional brand. Therefore, the actual 'Olympus' brand name is not visible.",

      "question": "Is there a large circular lens at the front of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera features a prominent circular lens at the front, which is characteristic of most film or digital SLR cameras. The lens is large relative to the body of the camera and has a reflective surface, indicating it is designed to capture light effectively. This aligns with common knowledge about camera design, where the front lens is a key component for focusing light onto the sensor or film. The illustration emphasizes this feature, making it clearly visible and central to the camera's appearance.",

      "question": "Are both hands visibly gripping the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands are shown holding the camera. The left hand supports the base of the camera, while the right hand is positioned on the top, near the shutter button and dials. This grip is typical for handling a camera securely during use. The fingers are clearly wrapped around the body, indicating active engagement with the device. There is no obstruction or ambiguity in the depiction, so both hands are visibly gripping the camera.",

      "question": "Is a brown leather strap attached to the camera and extending over the shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a brown strap is visible attached to the camera, running diagonally across the chest area. It connects to the sides of the camera body and extends upward toward the shoulder, consistent with how camera straps are typically worn. Although the full length of the strap isn't shown, the portion visible confirms its presence and function. This matches real-world usage where a shoulder strap provides support and prevents loss of the camera.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the denim jacket has two visible flap pockets on the front, one on each side of the chest. These pockets are outlined with stitching and have flaps that cover the openings, which is a standard design feature of many denim jackets. The illustration clearly depicts these details, including the button or snap closure on each flap. This design is common in casual outerwear and is consistent with typical fashion elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white blouse underneath the denim jacket displays vertical lines that resemble ridges or pleats. These lines run down the center of the blouse and extend outward, creating a structured, textured appearance. Such detailing is often used in clothing design to add visual interest and shape. The spacing and consistency of the lines suggest intentional pleating, which is a known garment construction technique. Therefore, the blouse does have vertical ridges or pleats.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a brown belt is visible around the waist, secured by a silver-colored rectangular buckle. The belt appears to be made of leather or a similar material, and the buckle is centrally located, matching the style commonly seen in casual wear. The buckle's shape and placement are consistent with typical belt designs. The illustration clearly shows this detail, confirming its presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera is positioned directly in front of the subjectâ€™s torso, at approximately chest level. It is held symmetrically with both hands, aligned vertically and horizontally with the center of the body. This positioning is typical when someone presents or uses a camera in a portrait-style pose. The alignment and balance of the camera in relation to the body confirm that it is held at chest height and centered.",
