    "Question": "Q1: Is the 'POLICE' and 'CME' text present on the driver’s side door in the same position and font style?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model of the police car shows the word 'POLICE' on the driver’s side door. However, the text 'CME' is not visible on the door in this image. Instead, the badge emblem is clearly visible, but there is no clear indication of 'CME' being present. The font style and positioning cannot be confirmed for 'CME' since it is absent. In contrast, in Image A (the original), both 'POLICE' and 'CME' are visible on the driver’s side door, with 'CME' positioned below the badge. This suggests that in the LEGO version, the 'CME' text has been omitted, possibly due to scale limitations or design choices. Therefore, the two texts are not present in the same way in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the gold-colored badge emblem with a shield and star design located on the driver’s side door?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model features a gold-colored badge emblem on the driver’s side door. The emblem includes a shield shape with a star design inside, consistent with typical police insignia. This matches common real-world police vehicle designs where such badges are placed on the doors. Comparing with Image A, the original car also has a similar badge on the driver’s side door, confirming that this feature is accurately replicated in the LEGO model. The placement and design are consistent with both visual cues and world knowledge about police vehicle branding.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the rooftop light bar have the exact red-blue-red-blue color sequence from left to right?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rooftop light bar on the LEGO model consists of four segments: red, blue, red, blue, from left to right when viewed from the front. This sequence matches the standard emergency light pattern used by police vehicles, which often alternate red and blue lights. The arrangement is symmetrical and follows the expected pattern. When comparing with Image A, the original vehicle also displays a similar red-blue-red-blue sequence, confirming consistency between the model and the real-life counterpart. The LEGO version faithfully reproduces this detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the front grille composed of horizontal slats with a central chrome bar?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front grille of the LEGO model appears to be made of black gridded pieces arranged in a square pattern, resembling a honeycomb or mesh structure rather than horizontal slats. There is no visible central chrome bar, as the entire grille is uniformly black without any metallic or reflective center piece. In contrast, Image A shows a more detailed grille with horizontal slats and a central chrome bar, which is typical of classic American police cars like the Ford LTD. The LEGO version simplifies the grille design for construction purposes, sacrificing some realism. Therefore, the description does not match the LEGO model.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the license plate displaying 'LIP' above 'CHICAGO POLICE'?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the license plate on the LEGO model clearly shows 'LIP' on the top line and 'CHICAGO POLICE' on the bottom line. This matches the text seen on the original vehicle in Image A, where the same license plate layout is present. The font and alignment are consistent across both images. This detail is likely included to reflect a fictional or stylized police department name, possibly referencing a game or media source. Since the LEGO model accurately replicates this plate, the answer is affirmative.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Does the car maintain the four-door sedan silhouette with a long hood and trunk?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model clearly exhibits a four-door sedan body style. It has two doors visible on each side, a long hood extending forward, and a similarly elongated trunk at the rear, consistent with classic American police sedans like the 1980s Ford LTD. The proportions, while slightly exaggerated due to the blocky nature of LEGO bricks, still preserve the iconic silhouette. Comparing with Image A, the original vehicle also has the same long-hood, long-trunk design, confirming that the LEGO version maintains this key characteristic. Thus, despite being a toy, the model successfully captures the overall shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Are the rectangular headlights and amber turn signals positioned symmetrically on the front fenders?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model features rectangular headlights on both sides of the front bumper, positioned symmetrically. Each headlight is flanked by an amber turn signal located just below and slightly outward on the front fender. These elements are mirrored on both sides, maintaining symmetry. This design aligns with typical police car configurations, where lighting components are balanced for visibility and aesthetics. In Image A, the original vehicle also has symmetrical headlights and amber turn signals, confirming that the LEGO model accurately reflects this design. The symmetry is preserved despite the simplified brick-based construction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
