    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the bear's snout and ears?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each of the six illustrated versions of the bear clearly shows a distinct snout and ears. The snout is consistently depicted as a dark, rounded nose with a small mouth beneath it, typical of a cartoon koala or bear-like character. The ears are present on top of the head in all poses, maintaining their shape and position relative to the head. This consistency across multiple expressions and actions confirms that the snout and ears are retained. From a design perspective, these features are essential for character recognition and emotional expression, which explains why they are preserved even when the bear’s pose or emotion changes. Comparing to Image A, the same anatomical features (snout and ears) are visible, so there is no change in this aspect. Therefore, the answer is based on visual confirmation across all instances in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the edited image retain the green Hawaiian shirt with orange polka dots and the straw hat?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, all six depictions of the bear wear the same green Hawaiian-style shirt adorned with white floral patterns and orange polka dots. The shirt is consistently worn across different poses and expressions, indicating it is a core part of the character’s identity. Additionally, the straw hat with a dark band is present in five out of the six illustrations, with only one variation showing the bear without the hat (sleeping). However, since the question asks whether the elements are 'retained' in general, and the majority of images include both items, and the hat is absent only in a sleeping state (which is a plausible variation), we can conclude that these clothing items are retained as key attributes. In Image A, the bear also wears the same outfit, confirming continuity. Thus, the retention of the shirt and hat is maintained throughout most of the edited image set.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image retain tropical background elements such as hibiscus flowers and palm fronds?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, tropical elements like hibiscus flowers and palm fronds appear in several of the panels. For example, in the top-left panel, a large orange hibiscus flower is visible behind the bear, and green palm fronds are seen in the top-right and bottom-left panels. These elements are stylized but clearly identifiable as tropical flora. While not every panel includes them—especially in the sleeping and pointing poses—their presence in multiple frames indicates that they are part of the overall theme. In contrast, Image A has a more prominent tropical background with larger floral and leafy elements. However, Image B still retains these motifs, albeit in a simplified or partial form depending on the pose. Given that the background elements are recurring and thematically consistent, they are considered retained in the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the edited image retain the bear's interaction with objects like the drink and chair where applicable?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bear interacts with various objects in different poses. For instance, in the top-left panel, the bear holds a cocktail with a tiny umbrella, similar to the pineapple drink in Image A. In other panels, the bear does not interact with a chair or drink, but instead performs actions like making a peace sign, crying, stretching, sleeping, pointing, or expressing love. Notably, the chair from Image A is absent in all panels of Image B. The bear is shown standing or lying down, not seated. However, the interaction with the drink is present in at least one panel (top-left), while the chair is completely omitted. Since the question asks about retention 'where applicable,' and the drink interaction is present in some cases, but the chair is not included at all, the overall interaction with those specific objects is not fully retained. In Image A, the bear is seated in a chair and holding a drink, which makes the full scene context different. Thus, while some object interactions are preserved, others (like the chair) are not, leading to an incomplete retention.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the edited image retain the vibrant color palette seen in the original image?",
    "explanation": "Image B maintains a bright and cheerful color scheme consistent with Image A. The use of soft pastel greens, warm oranges, and yellows for the shirt, hat, flowers, and skin tones reflects a vibrant tropical aesthetic. The colors are vivid and harmonious, contributing to a playful and summery mood. Even though the background is simpler in Image B (white or light gray), the character's colors remain saturated and lively. Comparing to Image A, which uses similar hues (e.g., teal shirt, orange flower, yellow hat), the palette is preserved in terms of tone and vibrancy. The slight variations in lighting or shading do not diminish the overall brightness. Therefore, despite stylistic differences in layout and composition, the vibrant color palette is effectively retained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
