      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is a decorative decanter shaped like a woman in classical attire. The basket she carries is positioned near her waist and contains various fruits. Upon close inspection, a cluster of purple grapes is clearly visible among the fruits in the basket. This detail is consistent with typical artistic representations of abundance or harvest themes, often seen in classical or allegorical art. The grapes are rendered in a realistic manner, with individual berries and leaves, confirming their presence.",

      "question": "Is the heart-shaped engraving present on the small terracotta jug?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small terracotta jug is held in the woman’s left arm. However, upon examining the surface of the jug, there is no visible heart-shaped engraving. Instead, the jug features a simple, stylized design that includes a curved handle and a smooth body, but no distinct heart shape. This contrasts with the common decorative motifs found in traditional pottery, where such symbols might be used to signify love or fertility. Given the visual evidence, the heart-shaped engraving is not present.",

      "question": "Is the goose depicted with a white body, orange beak, and webbed feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the goose is positioned at the base of the figure, standing on the ground. The goose has a predominantly white body with subtle grayish shading on its wings, an orange beak, and orange webbed feet. These features are consistent with the typical appearance of a domestic goose, especially in artistic renderings. The coloration and anatomical details (such as the webbed feet) are accurately portrayed, supporting the conclusion that the goose matches the description.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is wearing a cloak draped over her shoulders. At the neckline, there is a small, circular, gold-colored ornament that appears to be a clasp or brooch fastening the cloak. This detail is consistent with historical or classical fashion, where such clasps were commonly used to secure outer garments. The metallic sheen and placement suggest it is indeed a decorative clasp, reinforcing the idea of authenticity in the figure’s design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basket carried by the woman contains multiple fruits. A red apple is clearly visible, along with a green pear and a cluster of purple grapes. These items are arranged naturally within the basket, suggesting a theme of harvest or abundance. The colors and shapes of the fruits are distinct and recognizable, aligning with common depictions in classical art. Therefore, all three fruits mentioned in the question are present.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basket is located near the woman’s waist and is being held in her left arm. Her left hand supports the basket from underneath, while her right hand holds a large vase above her head. The positioning of the basket is consistent with natural posture and balance in figurative art. This arrangement is logical for carrying goods, especially when combined with other objects like the vase. Thus, the basket is correctly described as being near the waist and held in the left arm.",
