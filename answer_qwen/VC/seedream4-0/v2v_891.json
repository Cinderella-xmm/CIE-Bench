      "question": "Does the edited image retain a central object resembling a monitor, even in a stylized form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a central rectangular object with a dark screen and a stand, positioned similarly to how a monitor would be placed on a desk. Its shape, proportions, and placement within the scene strongly resemble a computer monitor, despite being part of a stylized, miniature setup inside a box labeled 'TECH LIFESTYLE'. The visual cues—such as the black screen, thin bezel, and support stand—are consistent with typical monitor design. Even though it is scaled down and presented in a whimsical context, its core characteristics align with those of a real-world monitor. This conclusion is drawn by comparing its form and function to common knowledge about computer monitors.",

      "question": "Does the edited image include an object resembling a speaker, even in a stylized form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small black rectangular object located to the left of the monitor, featuring two circular elements that resemble speaker drivers (a larger one at the bottom and a smaller one at the top). This configuration matches the typical design of a desktop speaker. Although the entire setup is miniaturized and enclosed in a decorative box, the object retains the essential visual features of a speaker. By combining visual analysis with world knowledge about audio equipment, we can confidently identify this as a stylized representation of a speaker.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a tall, rectangular black object located to the right of the monitor, which has a front panel with visible drive bays and ports, consistent with the design of a desktop computer tower. Despite being part of a miniature, stylized scene, its shape, size relative to other components, and functional details (like ventilation slots and I/O ports) are recognizable as those of a standard PC tower. This identification is supported by common knowledge of computer hardware layouts and design conventions.",

      "question": "Does the edited image include an object resembling a keyboard, even in a stylized form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a long, flat black object positioned in front of the monitor, with a grid-like pattern of small rectangular shapes that mimic keys. Its layout and position correspond to that of a standard QWERTY keyboard. Although it is scaled down and part of a playful, boxed display, the object's structure and placement clearly indicate it is meant to represent a keyboard. This conclusion is based on visual recognition of keyboard morphology and spatial arrangement in typical computing setups.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small, oval-shaped object with a button-like feature on top, placed near the keyboard inside the box. Additionally, another similar object is present outside the box, connected by a wire, glowing with sparkles, suggesting it is emphasized as a key component. Both objects match the general shape and design of a computer mouse. The external one, in particular, has a glossy finish and visible scroll wheel, reinforcing its identity. Even though the presentation is whimsical and stylized, the core form remains consistent with a real-world computer mouse. This assessment combines visual cues with familiarity with peripheral device design.",
