      "question": "Is the large circular rose window located above the central portal and featuring intricate radial tracery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the façade of the structure features a prominent circular window positioned directly above the central arched entrance. This window displays complex radial patterns consistent with traditional Gothic rose windows, which are known for their intricate tracery forming symmetrical floral or geometric designs. The visual details—such as the radiating lines and segmented sections—confirm that this is indeed a rose window with elaborate tracery. Given that rose windows are a hallmark of Gothic architecture and are typically placed above the central portal, the positioning and design align perfectly with architectural conventions. Therefore, based on both visual cues and world knowledge of Gothic cathedral design, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Are there three distinct arched entrances at the base of the façade, arranged symmetrically with the central one being the largest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows three arched doorways at the ground level of the façade. The central arch is significantly larger than the two flanking ones, and all three are aligned symmetrically along the vertical axis of the structure. This arrangement is typical of Gothic cathedrals, where the central portal is emphasized as the main entrance, often adorned with more elaborate carvings and sculptures. The side portals are smaller but mirror each other in form and detail. This symmetry and hierarchical sizing are consistent with standard Gothic façade design principles. Thus, based on visual evidence and architectural knowledge, the description matches the image.",

      "question": "Are there two tall, slender spires positioned symmetrically at the outer edges of the central gable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central gable (the triangular section above the rose window) is flanked by two tall, pointed structures that rise vertically from the sides of the façade. These spires are narrow and taper to sharp points, characteristic of Gothic architectural elements. They are placed symmetrically on either side of the central axis, matching in height, shape, and ornamental detailing. While they do not extend beyond the roofline as independent towers, they function as decorative pinnacles integrated into the façade’s upper structure. Their placement and form are consistent with Gothic design, where such spires contribute to vertical emphasis and symmetry. Therefore, the presence of these two symmetrically placed spires is confirmed.",

      "question": "Is the façade symmetrically balanced around a central vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The façade in Image B exhibits a high degree of symmetry. The central rose window is centered, with identical architectural elements mirrored on both sides: the three portals below, the columns, the arches, the pinnacles, and the spires. Even the decorative carvings and tracery appear to be mirrored across the vertical centerline. This bilateral symmetry is a defining feature of Gothic cathedral façades, designed to convey order, harmony, and divine proportion. The overall composition, including the placement of windows, arches, and vertical elements, reinforces this balance. Based on visual inspection and architectural norms, the façade is clearly symmetrically balanced.",

      "question": "Are there visible intricate stone carvings, including tracery, pinnacles, and sculptural details, across the façade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an abundance of detailed ornamentation across its surface. The rose window features elaborate tracery, with fine lines forming a complex pattern. Numerous small pinnacles rise from the roofline and corners, adding verticality and decoration. The arches, columns, and gables are adorned with carved motifs, including foliage, geometric patterns, and possibly figures (though not clearly discernible). These elements are consistent with Gothic architectural style, which emphasizes ornate stonework and vertical emphasis. The entire façade appears richly decorated, suggesting extensive sculptural detail. Therefore, the presence of intricate carvings, tracery, and pinnacles is evident.",

      "question": "Are there flying buttresses extending from the sides of the nave toward the exterior walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the view is limited to the front façade of the structure. There are no visible flying buttresses in this frontal perspective. Flying buttresses are external structural supports that typically extend from the nave walls to external piers, and they are usually seen from the side or rear views of a cathedral. Since the image only shows the front, and no lateral structures are visible, it is impossible to confirm the presence of flying buttresses from this angle. Moreover, the model-like nature of the image suggests it may be a scaled representation focusing on the façade rather than the full architectural system. Based on visual limitations and architectural knowledge, flying buttresses are not observable in this image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central rose window is positioned beneath a triangular gable. This gable forms the uppermost part of the façade's central section and is framed by two tall spires on either side. The gable itself is sharply angled and contains a smaller circular window or oculus at its apex, which is common in Gothic design. This triangular element sits directly above the rose window, serving as a capstone to the central portion of the façade. The presence of this gable is clearly visible and follows the typical Gothic architectural layout where a gable crowns the central section above the rose window. Therefore, the answer is yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows numerous slender, pointed pinnacles rising from various parts of the roofline. These are particularly visible along the central gable and the flanking sections, where they emerge from the tops of columns, arches, and buttresses. Pinnacles are a hallmark of Gothic architecture, used both decoratively and structurally to emphasize verticality. In this image, they are densely distributed and uniformly shaped, contributing to the ornate and upward-reaching aesthetic. Their presence is consistent across the central and side portions of the façade, confirming the description. Thus, based on visual evidence and architectural understanding, the answer is affirmative.",
