      "question": "Is the grid of yellow rounded domes covering the surface of the cake present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top surface of the cake is clearly covered with a uniform grid of yellow rounded domes. These domes are evenly spaced and consistent in size and shape, forming a textured pattern across the entire top surface. This visual feature matches the appearance of the original cake in Image A, where the same dome pattern is present. The presence of this pattern is confirmed by the clear visibility of each dome, especially around the cut section, which reveals the structure beneath without disrupting the overall dome arrangement.",

      "question": "Are there small red dots on top of each yellow dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, small red dots are visible atop each of the yellow domes. These dots appear to be strategically placed at the peak of each dome, adding a decorative element to the cake's surface. This detail is consistent with the original image (Image A), where similar red dots can be seen. The red dots likely represent a garnish such as jam or a fruit-based topping, enhancing both the visual appeal and flavor profile of the cake.",

      "question": "Is the cross-section showing a golden sponge base, white cream layer, and deep red jam layer visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a triangular slice has been removed from the cake, revealing its internal structure. The cross-section clearly shows three distinct layers: a golden sponge base at the bottom, a thick white cream layer in the middle, and a deep red jam layer above it. This layered composition is consistent with the typical construction of a fruit-filled cake. The visibility of these layers is enhanced by the clean cut and the contrast in color between the layers, making them easily distinguishable.",

      "question": "Are two strawberries with green leaves positioned at the top center of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top center of the cake in Image B, two strawberries with green leaves are clearly visible. They are placed side by side, serving as a decorative centerpiece. This placement and appearance match the original cake in Image A, where the same strawberries are positioned identically. The strawberries add a natural, fresh element to the cake's presentation, contrasting with the yellow domes and enhancing the overall aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are chopped nuts visible around the base of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Around the base of the cake in Image B, there is a scattering of small, brown particles that resemble chopped nuts. These are distributed along the perimeter of the cake, forming a decorative border. This detail is consistent with Image A, where the same nut-like garnish is present. The use of chopped nuts is a common technique in cake decoration to add texture and visual interest, particularly around the base of layered cakes.",

      "question": "Does the cake maintain a square shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cake in Image B retains a square shape, despite the removal of one corner slice. The remaining structure clearly forms a square outline, with straight edges and right angles. Even though a portion is missing, the overall geometry of the cake still aligns with a square form. This is consistent with Image A, where the cake is also square-shaped. The preservation of the square shape suggests careful cutting and presentation.",

      "question": "Is the cake placed on a silver-toned plate with an embossed floral pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cake in Image B is placed on a plate that appears to have a silver-toned surface with subtle embossed patterns. Upon closer inspection, faint floral designs can be seen on the plate, indicating an embossed floral pattern. This matches the plate in Image A, where the same type of plate is used. The choice of plate enhances the elegance of the presentation, complementing the cake's intricate design.",

      "question": "Is the deep red jam layer clearly visible between the white cream and golden sponge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cross-section of the cake in Image B, the deep red jam layer is clearly visible and distinct. It lies directly between the white cream layer above and the golden sponge layer below. The contrast in color makes the jam layer stand out, and its thickness is consistent throughout the exposed portion. This clarity is maintained even in the edited version, suggesting that the internal structure has not been altered significantly.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Is the white cream layer visible between the sponge and jam layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white cream layer is clearly visible in the cross-section of the cake in Image B. It is situated between the golden sponge base and the deep red jam layer, forming a substantial middle layer. The cream appears smooth and uniformly spread, providing a visual and textural contrast to the other layers. This arrangement is consistent with the original cake in Image A, where the same layering is evident.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden sponge base layer is clearly visible in the cross-section of the cake in Image B. It forms the bottommost layer and appears light yellow in color, characteristic of a sponge cake. Its texture is porous and airy, typical of sponge bases. The visibility of this layer is consistent with Image A, where the same sponge layer is exposed in the cut section. The intact nature of the sponge layer confirms its role as the foundation of the cake.",
