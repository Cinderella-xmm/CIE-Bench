    "Question": "Q4: Is there a clearly visible third eye centered on the forehead?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the third eye of Lord Shiva is not clearly visible. While the forehead is smooth and marked with a vertical line (tilaka), there is no distinct representation of a third eye—typically shown as a closed or open eye at the center of the forehead.

    "explanation": "In Image B, the deity's hair is styled in a jata (matted locks), which is characteristic of Shiva, but there is no visible crescent moon placed within the hair. The crescent moon is a common symbol associated with Shiva, representing time and cyclical nature, often seen in artistic depictions. However, in this image, the hair does not contain any lunar motif, making the absence notable. This differs from traditional iconography where the moon is usually present.",

    "Question": "Q7: Is the upper right hand raised with the index finger pointing upward and other fingers curled in abhaya mudra?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the upper right hand is raised, but it is not in the abhaya mudra. Instead, it is holding the trident vertically, which is a different gesture. The abhaya mudra involves the palm facing outward with the index finger pointing up and the rest curled, symbolizing protection and fearlessness. Here, the hand is occupied with the trident, so the mudra is not present. This contrasts with some traditional depictions where the abhaya mudra is used, but in this case, the hand is engaged with an object.",
