      "question": "Is the bag still rectangular in shape with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the overall silhouette of the bag maintains a rectangular form. The edges appear to be slightly curved or softened, suggesting rounded corners rather than sharp ones. This is consistent with typical bag design where corners are often subtly rounded for aesthetic and ergonomic reasons. Despite the dramatic change in material and pattern (now metallic with geometric designs), the fundamental shape has not been altered. The width and height proportions remain similar to those expected in a standard rectangular bag, and there is no indication of distortion or reshaping. Therefore, based on visual cues and common design principles, the bag retains its rectangular shape with rounded corners.",

      "question": "Does the bag retain a flap-over front section with a horizontal crease?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the bag features a distinct flap that covers the lower portion, which is characteristic of a flap-over design. A visible horizontal line runs across the top edge of this flap, indicating a crease or fold—likely formed by the flap being folded over the body of the bag. This crease is consistent with how such bags are structured, allowing the flap to lie flat when closed. Even though the surface texture has changed to a shiny, metallic finish with intricate patterns, the structural element of the flap and its crease remains intact. Thus, the bag retains the flap-over front section with a horizontal crease.",

      "question": "Is there a zipper running across the top edge of the bag with a visible gold-tone pull tab?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a zipper along the upper edge of the bag. The zipper teeth are visible, and it spans the full width of the top opening. At one end, a pull tab is present, which appears to be gold-toned, matching the description. While the surrounding material has been transformed into a reflective silver-metallic surface with teal accents, the zipper mechanism itself remains functional and visually identifiable. The presence of the pull tab confirms it is accessible and usable. This detail aligns with typical design elements of crossbody bags, where zippers provide secure closure. Therefore, the zipper with a gold-tone pull tab is present.",

      "question": "Are there two vertical stitched panels visible beneath the flap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at the area beneath the flap in Image B, two distinct vertical sections can be seen separated by a central seam. These sections have parallel lines and symmetrical design elements, suggesting they are stitched panels. Although the material is now metallic and highly decorative, the structure implies division into two parts, likely for both aesthetic and functional purposes (such as reinforcing the bag's shape). In contrast to the original monogram canvas, these panels are stylized but still follow the same spatial layout. Based on the visual symmetry and separation line, it is reasonable to conclude that two vertical stitched panels are present beneath the flap.",

      "question": "Does the bag have an adjustable shoulder strap with brass-colored buckles on both ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a shoulder strap is visible on both sides of the bag, attached via metal hardware. The strap appears to be made of brown leather, consistent with the original design. On each side, a buckle is present, and these buckles have a metallic finish that appears brass-colored. The presence of adjustment holes along the strap indicates it is adjustable in length. This feature is typical for crossbody bags, allowing users to customize fit. Despite the transformation of the bag’s main body into a futuristic metallic design, the strap and its hardware remain unchanged in function and appearance. Therefore, the bag does have an adjustable shoulder strap with brass-colored buckles on both ends.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag is oriented so that its longer axis is horizontal, meaning it lies flat from left to right. It is also upright, with the top edge aligned parallel to the top of the image and the bottom edge parallel to the bottom. The bag is centered within the frame, with equal white space on all sides, suggesting deliberate composition. This positioning is consistent with product photography standards, where items are displayed centrally for clear viewing. There is no tilt or rotation, and the perspective is straight-on. Thus, the bag is indeed positioned horizontally and upright in the center of the frame.",
