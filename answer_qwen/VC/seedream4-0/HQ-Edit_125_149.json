      "question": "Is the river present beneath the bridge, flowing from the background toward the foreground with visible white water over mossy rocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the river is clearly visible beneath the bridge structure. The flow of water appears to originate from the background and move toward the foreground, as indicated by the direction of ripples and cascades. White water is evident over several moss-covered rocks, suggesting turbulent flow typical of a stream in a forested area. This aligns with natural hydrological behavior in such environments, where elevation changes cause water to rush over obstacles. The presence of white water indicates kinetic energy in the flow, consistent with a fast-moving stream.",

      "question": "Are there moss-covered rocks visible in the river, especially near the center and right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, multiple rocks are visible within the river, particularly in the central and right portions of the image. These rocks are covered in green moss, which is common in damp, shaded forest environments where moisture levels are high. Moss growth on rocks in rivers typically occurs in areas with consistent water exposure and limited direct sunlight, both of which are present here. The texture and coloration of these rocks confirm their moss-covered state.",

      "question": "Are multiple fallen logs visible along the left and right riverbanks, some partially submerged in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows numerous fallen logs scattered along both the left and right riverbanks. On the left, several large logs lie parallel to the bank, some extending into the water. On the right, a cluster of smaller branches and logs is piled up, with parts submerged. These logs appear weathered and integrated into the natural environment, consistent with debris accumulation in forest streams. Their partial submersion suggests they have been in place long enough for water to interact with them, reinforcing the realism of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a canopy of green leaves overhead, allowing dappled sunlight to filter down onto the bridge and river?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overhead area in Image B displays a dense network of tree branches and foliage forming a canopy. Sunlight is visibly filtering through the leaves, creating patches of light and shadow on the bridge and river below—this is known as dappled lighting. Such lighting is characteristic of mature forests where sunlight penetrates only intermittently due to thick leaf coverage. The presence of this effect supports the idea of a lush, closed-canopy forest environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there several large, moss-covered tree trunks leaning toward the bridge from the left bank, with one prominently curving over the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the left side of Image B, multiple large tree trunks are visible, leaning toward the bridge. These trunks are covered in moss, indicating age and moisture-rich conditions. One prominent trunk curves significantly over the bridge, almost touching its upper structure. This curvature is plausible in old-growth forests where trees grow asymmetrically due to wind, gravity, or competition for light. The visual alignment and angle of this trunk suggest intentional compositional placement to emphasize the organic integration of nature and structure.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the image captured from a low-angle viewpoint, looking upward at the bridge from near the river level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The perspective in Image B is clearly from a low vantage point, close to the surface of the river. The bridge towers above the viewer, and the angle emphasizes verticality, making the structure appear imposing. The horizon line is positioned high in the frame, and the foreground includes elements like rocks and logs at eye level, while the bridge dominates the upper portion. This low-angle shot is commonly used in photography and art to convey grandeur and scale, especially when depicting architectural or natural structures in awe-inspiring settings.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the bridge structure extend horizontally across the river, supported by towers on both sides, forming a continuous span?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge spans the river horizontally, connecting both banks. It is supported by tall, structural towers—one visible on the left side (partially obscured by the tree-like figure) and another implied on the opposite side. The bridge deck appears continuous, running straight across the river. While the structure has an organic, skeletal appearance, it maintains the functional form of a suspension or truss bridge. The horizontal span is consistent with engineering principles for crossing waterways, even when stylized artistically.",
