      "question": "Is the \"Gibson\" logo in gold script visible on the headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headstock of the guitar is clearly visible at the top of the image. The 'Gibson' logo is present in a gold-colored script, consistent with the branding style typically used by Gibson guitars. This logo is positioned centrally on the headstock, which is a standard placement for this brand. The golden hue and cursive font are distinct and match the known design of Gibson's logo. Therefore, based on visual evidence and world knowledge of Gibson guitar branding, the logo is indeed visible.",
