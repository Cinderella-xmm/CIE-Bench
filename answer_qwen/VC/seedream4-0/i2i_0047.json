      "question": "Is the train still primarily painted in blue-purple with a yellow front and red doors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image provided (Image B) does not contain a train at all. Instead, it features a boy skateboarding in a futuristic, neon-lit urban environment. There is no train visible in this image. Therefore, any attributes related to the train's color scheme—such as blue-purple body, yellow front, or red doors—cannot be assessed because the train is absent. Based on visual cues alone, Image B contains no train, so the original description of the train’s paint scheme cannot apply.",

      "question": "Are the windows and doors on the train still arranged in their original positions and shapes as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a train, so there are no windows or doors from a train present. The scene instead depicts a boy skateboarding in a stylized cyberpunk cityscape. Since the train is entirely absent, there is no possibility of windows or doors being arranged in any position or shape as seen in the original image. The absence of the train means that this comparison is invalid based on the current image content.",

      "question": "Does the train remain connected to the railway tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no train present. The image shows a skateboarder in a vibrant, digitally enhanced urban setting with neon lights and motion blur effects. There are no railway tracks or trains visible. Therefore, the train cannot be connected to any tracks, as it does not exist in this image. This conclusion is based on the complete absence of rail-related elements in the scene.",

      "question": "Are the train wheels still visible and retain their original structure under the carriages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a train or any train carriages. Instead, it displays a child riding a skateboard with glowing wheels. There are no train wheels or undercarriage structures visible in the image. Thus, the question about the visibility or structural integrity of train wheels is irrelevant since the train itself is not present. The absence of the train makes it impossible for its wheels to be visible or structurally intact in this context.",

    {

      "question": "Are there any infrastructure elements (like bridges or platforms) surrounding the train in the new background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a train, so there is no surrounding infrastructure related to a train station or railway system. However, the background does feature urban infrastructure such as tall buildings, neon signs, and elevated roadways, which resemble a futuristic city. These elements are not related to train infrastructure like bridges or platforms but rather represent a stylized metropolitan environment. Therefore, while there are infrastructure elements, they are not specifically associated with the train or railway system.",
