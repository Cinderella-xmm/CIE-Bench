      "question": "Is the large circular mirror with an illuminated frame present above the black vanity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large circular mirror is clearly visible positioned directly above the black vanity. The mirror has a glowing, illuminated frame that emits a warm, golden light, enhancing its prominence in the space. This lighting effect is consistent with modern bathroom design trends where backlit mirrors are used to create ambiance and improve visibility. Based on visual cues, the mirror's shape, size, and illumination are all distinct and confirm its presence. There is no ambiguity in identifying this feature due to its central placement and unique lighting.",

      "question": "Does the black vanity cabinet have a white countertop hosting a rectangular sink with a black faucet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black vanity cabinet in Image B features a clean, minimalist design. On top of it sits a white countertop, which contrasts sharply with the dark cabinet. A rectangular undermount sink is embedded into the countertop, and a sleek black faucet with two handles is installed above it. These elements align with contemporary bathroom aesthetics, where contrasting colors and simple geometric shapes are common. The materials appear to be high-quality, such as quartz or engineered stone for the countertop and matte-finished metal for the faucet. All components match the description provided in the question.",

      "question": "Are the walls covered in light marble tiles with subtle veining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The walls in Image B are clad in large-format tiles that exhibit a light beige or off-white base color with natural-looking grayish-brown veining, characteristic of marble or marble-like stone finishes. The pattern is consistent across the wall surfaces, suggesting a uniform material application. Marble tiles are commonly used in high-end bathrooms for their elegance and durability. The subtle veining adds texture without overwhelming the space, contributing to a refined and modern atmosphere. Given these visual characteristics and typical interior design practices, it is reasonable to conclude that the walls are indeed covered in light marble tiles with subtle veining.",

      "question": "Are two wall sconces mounted on either side of the mirror, providing ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On both the left and right sides of the circular mirror, there are small, rectangular wall-mounted fixtures emitting a warm glow. These fixtures are symmetrically placed and appear to be sconces designed for ambient lighting. Their position relative to the mirror suggests they serve both functional and decorative purposesâ€”enhancing the lighting around the mirror area while complementing the overall aesthetic. In modern interior design, such sconces are often used to balance lighting and reduce shadows, especially in areas like bathrooms where task lighting is important. Therefore, based on their appearance, placement, and function, these are clearly wall sconces providing ambient illumination.",

      "question": "Is there a black vase with delicate flowering branches placed on the white countertop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the right side of the white countertop, there is a tall, slender black vase containing thin stems with small, pale pink or white blossoms. The arrangement appears to be dried or preserved floral stems, possibly cherry blossoms or similar ornamental branches, which are often used in minimalist decor for their delicate beauty. The vase matches the black theme of the vanity and faucet, creating a cohesive color scheme. The positioning of the vase on the countertop is intentional, serving as a decorative element that adds life and softness to the otherwise stark design. This detail is clearly visible and fits the description perfectly.",
