      "question": "Are the cheetahs in a seated position with bent hind legs, tucked tails, and upright front paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both cheetah figures are clearly depicted in a seated posture. Their hind legs are bent beneath their bodies, consistent with a sitting position. The tails are curled and tucked neatly behind them, resting on the base, which is typical of a relaxed seated pose. The front paws are positioned forward and appear upright, supporting the body’s weight. This posture aligns with common representations of seated feline statues. Based on visual cues and typical animal anatomy in sculpture, this configuration matches the description provided.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the head of each cheetah turned slightly to the side, away from the central divider?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the cheetahs in Image B, both heads are angled to the right (from the viewer's perspective), meaning they are looking toward the outer edge of the frame rather than directly forward or at the central divider. Since the divider is located between them, their gaze is indeed directed away from it. This slight lateral turn is consistent with sculptural design choices that convey alertness or naturalistic positioning. Therefore, the heads are turned slightly to the side, away from the central divider.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does each cheetah rest on a two-tiered base with a black upper section and a bronze-colored stepped lower section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each cheetah is mounted on a base that consists of two distinct levels. The upper part of the base is black and appears smooth and flat, while the lower section has a stepped, tiered design with a bronze or gold-toned finish. This structure matches the description of a two-tiered base with contrasting materials—black on top and bronze-colored below. This type of base is common in decorative statuary to provide stability and aesthetic contrast. The visual evidence supports this interpretation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the cheetah figures positioned symmetrically, one on the left and one on the right, equidistant from the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement in Image B shows one cheetah on the left and one on the right, with the central vertical panels placed exactly between them. Both figures appear to be mirrored in form, posture, and placement relative to the centerline of the image. The spacing between each cheetah and the central divider seems equal, indicating symmetry. This balanced composition is typical in bookends or decorative pairings, designed to create visual harmony. Thus, the positioning is symmetrical and equidistant from the center.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there exactly three vertical panels positioned between the cheetahs, with two narrower ones flanking a wider central one?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three vertical elements between the cheetahs. The central panel is taller and wider than the two on either side, which are thinner and shorter. These panels are transparent and green-tinted, resembling glass or acrylic. The layout follows a clear pattern: narrow-flanking-wide-central-narrow. However, upon closer inspection, only three panels are present: one central wide panel and two narrower ones on the sides. This matches the description of three panels with the central one being wider. The visual structure confirms this configuration.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the tail of each cheetah curve upward and rest on the base behind the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of each cheetah is visible and curves upward before looping down and making contact with the base. The tail does not hang freely but instead rests on the platform behind the body, forming a gentle arc. This curved shape is consistent with stylized animal sculptures where the tail is posed for balance and aesthetic appeal. The tail’s position is clearly above the base level initially, then comes to rest on it, fulfilling the description of curving upward and resting behind the body.",
