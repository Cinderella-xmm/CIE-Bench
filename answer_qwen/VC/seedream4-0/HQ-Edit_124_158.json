      "question": "Is the cat's fur pattern composed of dark brown or black stripes over a golden-orange base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat exhibits a tabby pattern with distinct dark stripes running across its body. The base color of the fur appears to be a warm, golden-orange hue, particularly visible on the chest and belly. The stripes are clearly dark brown to black in color, consistent with classic tabby markings. This combination is typical of many domestic tabby cats, especially those with a 'mackerel' or 'classic' tabby pattern. The visual evidence strongly supports that the fur pattern consists of dark stripes over a golden-orange base.",

      "question": "Does the cat have greenish-blue eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the cat’s face in Image B, the eyes appear to be a striking shade of greenish-blue. The irises have a noticeable blue-green tint, which is common in some domestic cats, particularly those with certain genetic traits. The lighting in the scene enhances this coloration, making it vivid and clear. There is no indication of yellow or amber tones that would suggest otherwise. Therefore, based on the visual cues and known feline eye color variations, the cat indeed has greenish-blue eyes.",

      "question": "Are the cat’s front paws crossed over its chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is seated in an upright position on a throne-like chair. Its front paws are positioned symmetrically in front of its chest, with one paw slightly overlapping the other. This posture resembles a relaxed, regal pose commonly seen in anthropomorphized depictions of cats. While not fully crossed like hands, the paws are clearly resting over the chest area in a manner that suggests a cross-like arrangement. Given the context and visual positioning, it is reasonable to interpret this as the paws being crossed over the chest.",

      "question": "Are there two square throw pillows with red floral patterns on a cream background flanking the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is seated on a small, ornate red velvet chair within a miniature stage-like setting. There are no throw pillows visible on either side of the cat. Instead, the scene includes decorative elements such as golden columns, red curtains, and framed pictures of mice. The absence of any pillows, let alone square ones with floral patterns, is evident. In contrast, Image A does feature such pillows, but they are not present in Image B. Thus, based solely on the visual content of Image B, the answer is no.",

      "question": "Is the cat’s tail curled along the left side of the settee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat’s tail extends from its body and rests along the left side of the chair (from the viewer's perspective). It curves gently downward and outward, following the contour of the seat. The tail is not tucked under or wrapped around the body, nor is it positioned on the right side. The left-side placement is consistent with the cat’s relaxed posture and the spatial layout of the chair. Therefore, the tail is indeed curled along the left side of the settee.",

      "question": "Is the settee upholstered in deep red velvet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chair in Image B is clearly upholstered in a rich, deep red fabric that has the texture and sheen characteristic of velvet. The material reflects light in a way that suggests a soft, plush surface, typical of velvet upholstery. Additionally, the luxurious design of the chair, including gold accents and ornate carvings, complements the opulent appearance of the red velvet. This matches common knowledge about high-end furniture used in theatrical or royal settings. Therefore, the settee is upholstered in deep red velvet.",

      "question": "Does the cat have a white muzzle and long white whiskers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat’s muzzle is predominantly a light beige or tan color, blending into the golden-orange base of its fur. There is no significant white patch on the muzzle. However, the cat does have long, prominent whiskers that are white in color, extending from the sides of its nose. While the whiskers are clearly white, the muzzle itself lacks the white coloring described in the question. Therefore, although the whiskers are white, the muzzle is not white, so the full description is inaccurate.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat’s ears are clearly upright and pointed, typical of an alert and attentive feline posture. The ears are triangular in shape and stand straight up from the head, indicating awareness of the surroundings. This is consistent with normal cat anatomy and behavior when a cat is awake and observing its environment. The ears do not appear folded or flattened, which would suggest fear or relaxation. Thus, based on visual observation and general feline biology, the cat’s ears are indeed upright and pointed.",
