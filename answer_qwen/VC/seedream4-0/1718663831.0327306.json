      "question": "Is the dog's fur primarily white with distinct sandy-colored spots on the ears and face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is a plush toy resembling a small breed such as a Pomeranian or Shiba Inu. Its fur appears to be predominantly white, with visible sandy-colored patches on the ears and around the face, including areas near the cheeks and forehead. These colorations are consistent with typical markings seen in certain dog breeds. The texture of the fur is soft and fluffy, characteristic of a stuffed animal. Based on visual inspection, the color distribution matches the description of white fur with distinct sandy-colored spots. This conclusion is supported by common knowledge about how breed-specific patterns appear on both real dogs and their plush representations.",

      "question": "Does the dog have a rounded head with pointed ears and a short muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the plush dog has a rounded head shape, which is typical for many stylized representations of small dog breeds. Its ears are upright and pointed, aligning with features commonly seen in breeds like the Pomeranian or Shiba Inu. The muzzle is short and compact, with a defined snout that ends just above the mouth, consistent with the facial structure of these breeds. While this is a stylized toy, its design closely mimics real-world canine anatomy. Therefore, based on the visual cues and general knowledge of dog morphology, the description fits accurately.",

      "question": "Are the dog wearing black rectangular sunglasses with dark lenses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is wearing a pair of sunglasses. The frames are black and have a rectangular shape, with straight edges and a classic design often associated with aviator or wayfarer-style glasses. The lenses are dark, blocking visibility through them, which is typical for sunglasses designed for sun protection. The positioning of the glasses over the eyes is accurate and symmetrical. These visual details match the description of black rectangular sunglasses with dark lenses. No other style or color variation is present, confirming the accuracy of the description.",

      "question": "Is the dog seated upright with its body facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush dog is positioned on a wooden shelf. It is sitting in an upright posture, with its back straight and its body oriented directly toward the viewer. Its legs are tucked beneath it, and its front paws rest flat on the surface, indicating a stable, seated position. The orientation of its head and torso confirms that it is facing forward. This posture is typical for display purposes in toys and aligns with common expectations for how stuffed animals are posed when showcased. Thus, the dog is indeed seated upright and facing forward.",

      "question": "Does the dog have a compact body with short legs and a fluffy tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, the plush dog exhibits a compact body structure, typical of small dog breeds. Its legs are short relative to its body size, which is consistent with breeds like Pomeranians. The tail is not fully visible due to the angle and positioning, but given the breed resemblance and the presence of a fluffy texture around the rear, it can be reasonably inferred that the tail is fluffy and likely curled over the backâ€”common traits in such breeds. However, since the tail is partially obscured and not clearly visible, we must rely on contextual clues and breed characteristics. Despite the limited view, the overall proportions suggest a compact build with short legs and a likely fluffy tail, as expected from the breed representation.",
