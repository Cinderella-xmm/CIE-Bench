      "question": "Does the dog retain its white fur color and sharp, upright ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is clearly visible with a predominantly white coat. The fur appears clean and uniformly white, with no signs of discoloration or patches of other colors. Its ears are pointed upward and erect, indicating alertness, which is typical of many dog breeds during active play. This observation aligns with common knowledge about canine anatomy and behavior—dogs often perk up their ears when engaged in energetic activities like chasing toys. There is no visual evidence to suggest any change in fur color or ear posture from the original state.",

      "question": "Is the dog's mouth open, showing its teeth and tongue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog’s mouth is wide open, revealing both its teeth and pink tongue. This expression is consistent with a dog in motion, possibly mid-bark or panting due to exertion. The visibility of the teeth and tongue suggests excitement or effort, which is typical during playful activity such as chasing a frisbee. From a biological standpoint, dogs often open their mouths and expose their tongues when running to regulate body temperature. The visual cues strongly support this interpretation.",

      "question": "Does the dog wear a red collar around its neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is wearing a red collar around its neck. The collar is clearly visible and appears to be made of fabric or leather, with a noticeable blue bow tie attached to it. While the presence of a bow tie adds an accessory detail, the red collar remains prominent. This matches typical pet accessories used for identification and decoration. The addition of the bow tie does not obscure the collar’s color or presence, confirming that the dog indeed wears a red collar.",

      "question": "Is the dog directed forward in the image, moving toward the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is captured mid-stride with its front paws extended forward and its body angled directly toward the viewer. The positioning of its legs and the direction of its gaze indicate forward movement. Additionally, the shallow depth of field and blurred background emphasize the sense of motion toward the camera. This composition is commonly used in action photography to convey dynamic movement. Based on these visual cues and general photographic principles, it can be concluded that the dog is moving forward toward the camera.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground beneath the dog is covered in green grass with scattered dry leaves, indicating an outdoor park-like setting. The background consists of out-of-focus greenery and tree trunks, suggesting a natural environment with trees. The use of a shallow depth of field blurs the background, drawing attention to the dog while still conveying the presence of trees. This technique is common in wildlife and pet photography to highlight the subject. Thus, the scene is indeed set on a grassy area with blurred trees in the background.",
