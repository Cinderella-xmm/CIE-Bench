      "question": "Do both players retain identifiable clothing (white shirts and shorts, white tank top with black bottoms) and hairstyles in the chibi version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two characters are depicted in a chibi art style, which simplifies and stylizes human figures. Despite the cartoonish exaggeration, both characters maintain key elements of their original attire. The player on the left wears a white short-sleeved shirt and dark shorts, consistent with the original image's left player. The player on the right wears a white tank top and black skirt, matching the original right player’s outfit. Their hairstyles—ponytails—are also preserved, though simplified. While the proportions are exaggerated for stylistic effect, the core clothing and hairstyle features remain recognizable through visual cues and common knowledge about character design in chibi art, where essential attributes are retained even when details are minimized.",

      "question": "Are both players still holding tennis rackets in the chibi rendition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both chibi characters are clearly shown holding tennis rackets. The racket held by the left character is red-framed with a visible string pattern, and the one held by the right character has a blue frame and handle. These objects are proportionally scaled to match the chibi style but remain identifiable as tennis rackets based on their shape and placement in the hands. This aligns with the original image where both players hold rackets, and in the edited version, this detail is preserved to maintain context and continuity. Even in stylized forms, the presence of rackets is unambiguous due to their distinct structure and positioning.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the handshake pose still maintained between the two chibi players over the net?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both chibi characters are positioned across the net and are depicted extending their hands toward each other, meeting at the center above the net. This gesture mirrors the handshake seen in the original image. Although the chibi style alters proportions and facial expressions, the spatial relationship and hand interaction are preserved. The arms are outstretched, and the hands are clasped, indicating a mutual greeting or sportsmanship moment. This reflects common practices in animation and illustration to retain meaningful gestures despite stylistic changes. Thus, the handshake pose is accurately maintained.",

      "question": "Are tennis balls and the net still present in the foreground and middle ground respectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the net is clearly visible in the middle ground, running horizontally across the scene and dividing the two characters. It maintains the same structural appearance as in the original image, with mesh and posts. Additionally, tennis balls are present in the foreground—specifically, two yellow balls appear near the scoreboard on the left side of the image. While they may be slightly stylized, their color and spherical shape make them identifiable as tennis balls. This matches the original image where balls are placed near the scoreboard. Therefore, both the net and tennis balls are retained in appropriate positions.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background still depict an outdoor tennis court or at least retain visual hints of it (e.g., court lines, fencing)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B includes visual elements that strongly suggest an outdoor tennis court. White boundary lines are visible on the green surface, consistent with standard tennis court markings. A chain-link fence runs along the back, reinforcing the outdoor setting. Additionally, the lighting appears bright and even, typical of daylight conditions. These cues—court lines, fencing, and lighting—are all present and recognizable, even if slightly blurred or softened in the chibi style. This retention of environmental details ensures that the setting remains identifiable as a tennis court, maintaining contextual accuracy despite the artistic transformation.",
