    "Question": "Q1: Are the original seam lines (including those around the front pocket and vertical panel divisions) preserved as embossed linear patterns on the transformed glass vessel?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed object is a tall, rectangular purple glass vessel with a grid-like pattern of raised, embossed lines that divide its surface into square sections. These embossed lines are consistent in spacing and depth, resembling structural seams or panels. Comparing this to typical suitcase designs, the original suitcase (Image A) features visible seam lines around the front pocket and vertical panel divisions, which are characteristic of stitched or reinforced fabric edges. In the transformation, these functional seams have been artistically reinterpreted as decorative embossed lines on the glass surface. The pattern matches the general layout of the original seams—especially around the front pocket area and along vertical divisions—suggesting a direct preservation of form through material transformation. Therefore, the original seam lines are indeed preserved as embossed linear patterns.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the brand logo positioned near the top center of the front face of the transformed object?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front face of the glass vessel displays an engraved or etched monogram 'C' near the upper portion, slightly below the pump dispenser. This placement aligns with the top center region of the front panel. In Image A, the original suitcase has a small, metallic brand logo located at the top center of the front face, just above the front pocket. The transformation maintains this spatial relationship by placing a stylized version of the logo in the same relative position on the glass vessel. The design choice reflects a deliberate preservation of branding identity and visual hierarchy, even though the medium has changed from metal hardware to etched glass. Thus, the logo's position is preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the metallic spray nozzle located at the top center of the object, aligned vertically with the original handle’s position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object features a metallic pump dispenser at the very top center, which serves as a functional nozzle for dispensing liquid. This component is centrally aligned along the vertical axis of the vessel. In Image A, the original suitcase has a telescopic handle that extends upward from the top center, which is also vertically centered. The transformation replaces the handle with a pump mechanism, but it maintains the same central alignment. Since both the original handle and the new nozzle occupy the same vertical axis and top-center location, the alignment is preserved despite the change in function. This suggests intentional design continuity in the transformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are four decorative caps present at the base corners of the transformed object, corresponding to the original wheel positions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the glass vessel is supported by four small, ornamental purple caps arranged at each corner. These caps resemble miniature feet or decorative elements and are positioned exactly where the wheels of the original suitcase (Image A) would be located. The original suitcase has four multi-directional spinner wheels at its base corners, providing mobility. In the transformed version, these functional wheels are replaced with aesthetic caps that mimic their shape and placement. This substitution preserves the spatial configuration while transforming utility into decoration. Therefore, the presence of four decorative caps at the base corners corresponds directly to the original wheel positions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the two zipper tracks of the front pocket preserved as linear features on the transformed object, maintaining their parallel alignment and position within the front panel?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the front pocket of the suitcase has two parallel zipper tracks running horizontally across the upper section of the pocket, which are clearly visible as raised, linear elements. In Image B, the transformed glass vessel does not show any distinct linear features that correspond to zippers. Instead, the front panel has embossed grid lines and no indication of dual parallel tracks. While the overall structure of the front panel is preserved in terms of shape and proportion, the specific detail of the two zipper tracks is absent in the glass version. There is no evidence of such linear features being translated into the design. Therefore, the zipper tracks are not preserved.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q6: Is a handle present on the right side of the transformed object, corresponding to the original side handle’s position?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the suitcase has a side handle on the right side, which is a black, ergonomic grip attached vertically to the body for carrying. In Image B, the transformed glass vessel has no physical handle on its right side. Instead, the object stands upright with a smooth, uninterrupted surface on all sides, including the right. The only functional component is the pump at the top. There is no indication of a side handle or any structural feature that could serve as one. The transformation appears to have removed all handles except for the top pump, suggesting that the side handle was omitted in favor of a minimalist design. Therefore, a handle is not present on the right side.",
    "answer": "No"
