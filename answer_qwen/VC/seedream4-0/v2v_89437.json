      "question": "Is the ALSC logo present in the bottom right corner with the blue \"ALSC\" text, the integrated black checkmark, and the full name \"AUTHENTICATION LEGALIZATION SERVICES CANADA\" in black capital letters below it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom right corner features a logo with the blue text 'ALSC' prominently displayed. A black checkmark is integrated into the design, forming part of the 'A' in ALSC. Below the blue text, the full name 'AUTHENTICATION LEGALIZATION SERVICES CANADA' is written in black capital letters. This matches the description provided in the question. The presence of these elements—blue 'ALSC', black checkmark, and the full name in black capitals—is consistent with the original branding style seen in Image A, confirming that the logo is correctly represented in Image B.",

      "question": "Are there exactly five orange circular markers positioned along the black checkmark pathway, each containing a white icon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are five orange circular markers positioned along the black checkmark pathway. Each circle contains a white icon: a magnifying glass over a document, people running (indicating speed), a person hanging a document on a board, two people carrying a document, and a checkmark next to a document. These icons correspond to the steps in the process. Despite the red ribbons added for visual effect, the number of orange circles remains five, and each contains a distinct white icon. Therefore, the count and content of the orange circles match the description.",

      "question": "Is the icon in the first orange circle (bottom-left) a white magnifying glass over a document?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The first orange circle in the bottom-left corner of Image B contains a white icon depicting a magnifying glass over a document. This is consistent with the concept of document verification, which aligns with the text 'We verify your Document' adjacent to it. The icon is clearly visible despite some overlay from red ribbons, but its core elements—a magnifying glass and a document—are distinguishable. This matches the description in the question.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Next to the first orange circle in Image B, the text reads 'We verify your Document'. This is clearly legible despite the visual clutter introduced by the red ribbons. The wording is identical to the one in Image A, maintaining consistency in messaging. The placement and content match the expected text as described in the question.",

      "question": "Are there five blue dots placed along the black checkmark pathway, one between each pair of adjacent orange circles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are five orange circles along the black checkmark pathway. Between each pair of adjacent orange circles, there is a blue dot. Counting them: between circle 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, and 4 and 5, there are four blue dots. However, there is an additional blue dot at the very start of the path (before the first orange circle), making a total of five blue dots. This matches the description in the question, where one blue dot is placed between each pair of adjacent orange circles, and the initial dot is also part of the sequence. Thus, the count is correct.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, the title 'ALSC 5 Easy Steps' is displayed in bold blue font. Directly below it, the subtitle 'For documents to be used in Qatar' appears in smaller blue font. Both texts are clearly visible and maintain the same formatting and color scheme as in Image A. The positioning and typography match the description in the question, confirming that the title and subtitle are present and correctly formatted.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is not plain white. It has a subtle texture resembling a light gray or off-white paper surface with faint patterns, possibly simulating a canvas or textured paper effect. Additionally, there are red ribbons overlaid across the image, which add color and visual complexity. This contrasts with the plain white background of Image A. Therefore, the background in Image B is not plain white; it includes textures and colors.",
