      "question": "Is the bird’s crest upright and vividly blue, matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's crest is clearly visible and stands upright, which is a characteristic feature of blue jays. The crest is rendered in a vivid shade of blue, consistent with the natural coloration of a blue jay. This matches the appearance seen in Image A, where the crest is also upright and blue. Based on visual cues and world knowledge about blue jays—known for their prominent, erectile crests that are bright blue—the depiction in Image B accurately reflects this trait. There is no indication of distortion or color deviation; thus, the crest appears both upright and vividly blue.",

      "question": "Are there distinct white markings around the eye and a black stripe running through the face, as seen in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the bird has a clear white patch surrounding the eye, which is a typical facial marking of blue jays. Additionally, a distinct black stripe runs from the beak through the eye area, extending toward the back of the head—a key identifying feature of the species. These markings are consistent with those seen in Image A, where the same pattern is present. Using world knowledge, we know that blue jays have a 'mask' of black feathers across the face, contrasting with the white cheek area. The depiction in Image B faithfully reproduces this pattern, indicating accurate representation.",

      "question": "Do the wings display clear white patches resembling clouds against a blue background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wing feathers exhibit a pattern of white patches set against a deep blue background. These white areas are irregular in shape and distributed in a way that resembles cloud-like formations, particularly noticeable on the secondary flight feathers. This matches the known plumage pattern of blue jays, which have bold white bars or spots on their wings. Comparing to Image A, the same pattern is visible, confirming consistency. The rendering in Image B captures this detail well, using contrast and texture to emphasize the cloud-like effect.",

      "question": "Does the tail show vertical blue and black bars ending in white tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail feathers in Image B are long and prominently displayed, showing alternating vertical bands of blue and black. Each feather ends in a white tip, which is a hallmark of blue jay tail morphology. This pattern is consistent with real blue jays, whose tails feature such barring and terminal white edges. In Image A, the same tail structure is present, with similar banding and white tips. The lighting and clarity in Image B enhance the visibility of these features, allowing for confident identification. Therefore, the tail in Image B correctly displays the expected pattern.",

      "question": "Is the bird positioned on a wooden surface, maintaining the perching posture from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is perched on a small wooden branch within a glass dome. While the surface is wooden, it is not a flat horizontal plank like in Image A (where the bird sits on a fence rail). Instead, it is a naturalistic branch supported by a tree stump base. However, the bird’s posture—standing upright with feet gripping the perch—is consistent with the perching behavior seen in Image A. Despite the change in substrate, the overall stance and orientation remain faithful to the original. Thus, while the type of wooden surface differs, the perching posture is maintained.",

      "question": "Are the primary colors of the bird predominantly vibrant blue and white, matching the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bird with a dominant color palette of vibrant blue and white, which is accurate to the natural appearance of a blue jay. The upperparts—including the head, back, and wings—are a rich blue, while the underparts and facial markings are white. The tail and wing patterns reinforce this color scheme. This matches Image A, where the same blue and white coloration is evident. World knowledge confirms that blue jays are characterized by this striking contrast. The digital rendering in Image B enhances the vibrancy without distorting the natural hues, preserving the authenticity of the bird’s appearance.",
