      "question": "Is the McLaren logo present on the front hood of the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front hood of the car is visible, and although the logo is small, it can be identified as the McLaren emblem located centrally on the hood. This placement is consistent with typical McLaren design, where the brand's logo is prominently displayed on the front center of the vehicle. The logo appears to be a silver or chrome-colored insignia, which matches the known branding style of McLaren. Given that this is a high-resolution image and the logo is clearly distinguishable despite its size, it confirms the presence of the McLaren logo.",

      "question": "Are the front headlights shaped as narrow, trapezoidal units with sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The front headlights in Image B are clearly visible and exhibit a sleek, angular design. They are narrow and elongated horizontally, with sharp edges that taper toward the outer edges, forming a trapezoidal shape. This design is characteristic of modern McLaren models such as the 720S, which feature aggressive, aerodynamic headlight contours. The lighting elements appear to be integrated into a sculpted housing that emphasizes sharp lines, aligning with the described shape. Therefore, based on visual analysis and knowledge of McLaren’s design language, the headlights match the description.",

      "question": "Are red brake calipers visible behind the black multi-spoke wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front wheel is clearly visible, showing a black multi-spoke alloy rim. Behind the spokes, bright red brake calipers can be seen, which are a signature feature of high-performance McLaren vehicles. These calipers contrast sharply with the black wheels and are positioned precisely where brake components would be located. Red calipers are commonly used in performance cars for both functional and aesthetic purposes, and their visibility here is consistent with McLaren's branding and engineering emphasis on performance. Thus, the presence of red brake calipers is confirmed.",

      "question": "Is there a black angular side air intake vent running along the door line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The side profile of the car in Image B shows a distinct black air intake vent located just behind the front wheel, extending along the door line. This vent has an angular, geometric shape that integrates seamlessly into the bodywork, typical of McLaren’s aerodynamic design. The purpose of such vents is to channel airflow to cool the brakes and engine, especially in mid-engine sports cars. The black finish contrasts with the silver body, making it highly visible. This feature is consistent with the design of McLaren 720S models, confirming the presence of such an intake.",

      "question": "Is the car painted in a metallic silver finish with visible surface reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The car in Image B displays a glossy, reflective surface that indicates a metallic silver paint finish. Light reflects off the body panels in a way that suggests depth and shine, typical of high-quality automotive paint jobs. The reflections of the surrounding environment, including the display case and lighting, are visible on the car’s surface, further confirming the metallic nature of the paint. This finish is common in luxury and performance vehicles like the McLaren, where aesthetics and material quality are emphasized. The visual cues strongly support the conclusion that the car has a metallic silver finish with noticeable reflections.",

      "question": "Does the car have a visible dihedral door line extending from the front fender to the rear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The door design of the car in Image B shows a clear upward sweep starting from the front fender and continuing toward the rear, indicative of a dihedral door configuration. Dihedral doors are a hallmark of McLaren vehicles, opening upward at an angle to allow access while maintaining aerodynamic efficiency. The seam along the door edge is visible and follows a smooth, continuous line from front to back, consistent with this design. Although the doors are closed, the structural outline suggests their unique hinge mechanism. This feature is well-documented in McLaren models, reinforcing the identification.",

      "question": "Is the car proportioned with a long front hood and short rear deck, characteristic of a mid-engine layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall proportions of the car in Image B show a long front hood extending over the front axle, while the rear deck is relatively short, ending abruptly behind the passenger compartment. This configuration is typical of mid-engine sports cars, where the engine is positioned behind the driver but ahead of the rear axle, resulting in a compact rear section. The balance between the front and rear sections, combined with the low-slung profile and central cockpit placement, aligns with the design principles of mid-engine vehicles like the McLaren 720S. This proportioning enhances weight distribution and handling, which is a key feature of such high-performance cars.",
