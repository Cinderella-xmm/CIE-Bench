      "question": "Is the circular front plate with rivets on the steam locomotive present and accurately rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the steam locomotive clearly displays a large circular plate, which is characteristic of classic steam engines. This plate includes visible rivets arranged in concentric circles, consistent with historical engineering practices for such locomotives. The rendering appears detailed and accurate, matching real-world designs where the front plate (often called the 'firebox door' or 'front head') was secured with rivets to withstand pressure. The visual cues—such as shading, texture, and placement—align with known locomotive construction. There are no distortions or omissions in this feature.",

      "question": "Is the station building made of red brick with a gabled roof and two arched windows visible and unaltered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The station building in Image B is constructed from red brick, evident from its color and texture. It features a gabled roof with wooden shingles and two prominent arched windows on the right side, consistent with typical 19th-century railway station architecture. The structure remains visually intact and unaltered compared to standard depictions of such buildings. No changes in shape, materials, or window design are apparent, indicating that the architectural elements are preserved as intended.",

      "question": "Are all individuals standing in their original positions on the platform, facing the train or grouped as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the general arrangement of people on the platform in Image B resembles the original scene, there are notable differences in positioning and posture. In particular, the figures appear more stylized and cartoonish, with exaggerated proportions and simplified facial features. Their spacing and orientation have been slightly adjusted—some individuals are closer together, and others face different directions than in the original. Additionally, the overall composition suggests a deliberate artistic reinterpretation rather than a faithful preservation of positions. Therefore, while the grouping is similar, the exact positions are not maintained.",

      "question": "Do all individuals wear the same clothing items as in the original image, including long dresses, suits, and hats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The individuals in Image B are dressed in period-appropriate attire, including long dresses, suits, and hats, consistent with late 19th- or early 20th-century fashion. However, due to the stylized, animated nature of the characters, the clothing lacks fine detail and realistic fabric texture seen in the original. While the types of garments (e.g., high collars, wide-brimmed hats) match, the execution is simplified and cartoon-like. Thus, the clothing items are conceptually the same but not rendered with the same fidelity as in the original.",

      "question": "Is the woman near the edge of the platform holding a rectangular leather suitcase in her right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman positioned near the edge of the platform is indeed holding a rectangular object that resembles a leather suitcase. It is brown in color and has a handle, consistent with vintage luggage. She holds it in her right hand, which matches the description. Despite the stylized art style, the object's shape, size, and placement are clear and align with the expected appearance of a suitcase. No ambiguity exists in identifying this item.",

      "question": "Are the railway tracks composed of wooden sleepers and metal rails, extending diagonally from the foreground toward the train?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The railway tracks in Image B are clearly visible and consist of evenly spaced wooden sleepers beneath parallel metal rails. They extend diagonally from the lower-left foreground into the midground, converging toward the locomotive. This perspective is typical of railway scenes and correctly represents how tracks appear in depth. The materials and layout are consistent with historical rail systems, and the rendering is accurate in both structure and alignment.",

      "question": "Is a thick, dark smoke plume rising vertically from the train’s chimney into the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A thick, dark smoke plume is visibly emanating from the chimney of the locomotive in Image B. The smoke is dense and billows upward, forming a vertical column that disperses into the sky. Its color and texture suggest combustion from coal, typical of steam engines. Although the plume shows some slight curvature due to wind effects, it is primarily vertical and consistent with real-world behavior of steam locomotive emissions. The depiction is realistic and well-rendered.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B casts a warm, golden hue over the entire scene, particularly noticeable on the station building, the grass, and the figures. Shadows are soft and elongated, indicating a low sun angle typical of late afternoon. The sky has a hazy, diffused quality with subtle gradients from pale blue to yellow-orange, reinforcing the impression of sunset or dusk. These visual cues collectively suggest a time of day around late afternoon, consistent with the described lighting conditions.",
