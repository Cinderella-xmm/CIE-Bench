      "question": "Is the large central rose still present and located at the center of the teapot's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is made of clear glass with an etched floral design. The central motif is clearly a large rose, positioned in the middle of the teapot's body. This rose is intricately detailed and appears to be the focal point of the design, just as one would expect from a traditional decorative teapot. The etching technique gives it a frosted appearance, but the shape and placement are consistent with a centrally located rose. Based on visual analysis and common design principles for ornamental teapots, the central rose remains a dominant feature. There is no indication that this element has been removed or repositioned.",

      "question": "Are the surrounding leaves and smaller flowers arranged symmetrically around the central rose in the same configuration as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral pattern includes leaves and smaller blossoms that radiate outward from the central rose. These elements appear to be arranged in a balanced, symmetrical fashion typical of classical etched glass designs. The symmetry is evident in the mirrored placement of leaves and secondary flowers on either side of the rose. While direct comparison with Image A is not required here, based on world knowledge of decorative glassware, such patterns often follow strict symmetry for aesthetic harmony. However, without seeing the exact configuration in Image A, we cannot definitively confirm if the arrangement is identical. But given the high fidelity of the design and common artistic conventions, it is likely that the layout is preserved. Therefore, based on visual cues in Image B alone, the arrangement appears symmetrical and consistent with traditional patterns.",

      "question": "Is the spout still positioned on the left side of the teapot and shaped with a smooth, curved extension?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spout is clearly visible on the left side of the teapot. It is crafted from amber-colored glass and exhibits a smooth, curved form that extends outward and slightly upward, consistent with functional and aesthetic design principles for teapots. The curvature allows for controlled pouring, which aligns with practical usage. The material and shape suggest continuity with traditional forms, even though the medium (glass) differs from metal. There is no distortion or misplacement; the spout maintains its expected position and elegant curve.",

      "question": "Is the handle still attached to the right side of the teapot and maintains an arched shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle is located on the right side of the teapot, opposite the spout, which is standard for ergonomic use. It is made of amber-colored glass and features a graceful arch, curving upward and back toward the body. This arched shape provides a comfortable grip and is consistent with both functional and decorative design norms for glass teapots. The connection points to the body are secure and visually integrated, indicating that the handle remains intact and in its correct position.",

      "question": "Is the finial still present on top of the lid and retains its decorative knob-like shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lid of the teapot is topped with a small, rounded finial that resembles a knob. It is made of clear glass and sits precisely at the apex of the domed lid. This type of finial is common in glass teapots and serves both a decorative and functional purposeâ€”allowing for easy lifting of the lid. Its shape is consistent with a classic knob design, and there is no evidence of alteration or absence. Thus, the finial is present and retains its intended form.",

      "question": "Is the lid still covering the top of the teapot and retaining its domed shape with the decorative band near the rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lid is fully in place, covering the top of the teapot. It has a smooth, domed shape typical of traditional teapot lids, ensuring a snug fit. Near the rim, there is a subtle decorative band formed by the transition between the clear glass and the etched surface, which adds a refined detail. Although this band is not metallic like in some metal teapots, it still functions as a decorative accent. The overall structure of the lid is intact and matches the expected design of a glass teapot with a well-fitted cover.",

      "question": "Does the teapot retain its rounded, bulbous body shape with a smooth transition between the base and the upper section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the teapot is distinctly rounded and bulbous, characteristic of many classic teapot designs. The transition from the base to the upper section is seamless and smooth, without any sharp angles or irregularities. This shape not only enhances aesthetic appeal but also contributes to stability and balance when placed on a surface. The glass material allows for clarity in observing the contours, confirming that the form is consistent with traditional teapot silhouettes. The reflection on the glass surface further emphasizes the uniform curvature.",
