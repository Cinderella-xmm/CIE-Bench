      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a black cabinet with drawers is visible beneath the round mirror. The cabinet has a modern design with multiple drawers, consistent with the style of a dresser or storage unit. It is positioned directly under the mirror and appears to be made of dark material, likely wood or laminate, matching the aesthetic of the room. Based on visual cues, this object is clearly present and functions as a storage piece. Although the structure differs slightly from a traditional chest of drawers (e.g., it includes a desk-like surface), it still qualifies as a drawer cabinet. Therefore, the black drawer cabinet is indeed present.",

      "question": "Does the image still feature a large round mirror above the drawer cabinet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large circular mirror is mounted on the wall directly above the black cabinet. It has a thick black frame and reflects no visible surroundings, appearing as a solid black circle due to lighting or angle. This matches the description of a large round mirror. Its placement and size are consistent with typical decorative mirrors used in modern interiors. Comparing to Image A, the mirror in Image A also appears round and black-framed, though its reflective surface shows the room’s reflection. In Image B, the mirror remains in the same position but appears non-reflective, possibly due to lighting conditions or editing. However, its presence as a large round mirror above the cabinet is confirmed by its shape and location.",

      "question": "Is natural light still entering the room from the window on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a tall, vertical window on the left side of the frame. The window is bright, allowing daylight to illuminate the room, casting soft shadows and highlighting the textures of the furniture and floor. The view outside shows blurred greenery, indicating it is daytime. Natural light is visibly streaming in, creating a well-lit environment. This aligns with common knowledge that windows allow sunlight into rooms during the day. In Image A, the same window is present and similarly lit, confirming consistency in lighting conditions. Thus, natural light continues to enter the room from the left-side window.",

      "question": "Is there still a potted plant with long green leaves on the right side of the drawer cabinet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a potted plant with long, broad green leaves is visible on the right side of the cabinet. The plant is housed in a woven, cylindrical pot, and its foliage is lush and upright, resembling a bird of paradise or similar tropical houseplant. This matches the description of a potted plant with long green leaves. Comparing to Image A, the same type of plant is present in the same location, confirming continuity. While the plant's appearance may vary slightly in detail due to lighting or editing, its core features—long green leaves and placement—are preserved. Therefore, the potted plant is still present.",

      "question": "Does the floor still have a light wood texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flooring consists of planks with a light brown tone and visible wood grain patterns, characteristic of light-colored hardwood or engineered wood flooring. The texture appears smooth and polished, consistent with modern interior design preferences. This matches the description of a light wood texture. In Image A, the floor is identical in color, pattern, and material, suggesting no change in flooring. Given that both images show the same room layout and materials, and the floor in Image B maintains the same visual properties, it can be concluded that the floor still has a light wood texture.",
