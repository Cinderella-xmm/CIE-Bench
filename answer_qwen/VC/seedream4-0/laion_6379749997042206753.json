      "question": "Is the brand name \"Karls\" clearly visible on the label of the jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jar is illustrated in a cartoon style and contains a label with text. The brand name 'Karls' is displayed at the top of the label in green lettering with a small strawberry icon above it. This branding is consistent with the visual design seen in real-world product packaging and matches the appearance in Image A. The text is clear and legible despite the stylized nature of the illustration, confirming that 'Karls' is indeed visible.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Pumpkin Spice Popcorn\" present on the label of the jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label on the jar in Image B clearly displays the words 'Pumpkin Spice Popcorn' in a decorative font. 'Pumpkin Spice' is written in white cursive script over an orange background, and 'POPCORN' is written below in bold capital letters on a dark brown banner. This matches the product name as shown in Image A and aligns with typical food labeling conventions for flavor identification. The text is prominent and readable, confirming its presence.",

      "question": "Is the popcorn contained in a clear glass jar with a silver metal lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jar is depicted as transparent, allowing the popcorn inside to be visible, which indicates it is made of clear glass. However, unlike in Image A where the jar has a silver metal lid, this cartoon version shows no lid at all. Instead, the jar appears open with popcorn popping out dramatically. While the material of the jar is consistent with glass (clear), the absence of a lid contradicts the description of a silver metal lid. Therefore, only part of the condition is met.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes several bowls at the bottom of the illustration, each filled with popcorn. One of these bowls is white with a blue rim, matching the description exactly. This detail is consistent with the bowls seen in Image A, suggesting continuity in product presentation. The bowl's shape, color, and contents are clearly depicted in the cartoon style, confirming its presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration shows a sequence of events starting from a corn kernel character transforming into popcorn. While there is no actual separate jar filled with unpopped kernels like in Image A, the initial stage of the journey features a single anthropomorphized corn kernel wearing clothing, symbolizing the raw ingredient. This artistic representation implies the existence of unpopped kernels but does not depict them in a physical jar. Thus, while conceptually present, they are not shown in a separate clear jar as described.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label on the jar in Image B uses a vibrant orange background with brown accents, including the banner under 'POPCORN'. The popcorn itself is illustrated in shades of yellow-orange, consistent with pumpkin spice flavoring. These colors are typical for autumn-themed products and match the color scheme seen in Image A. The combination of orange and brown dominates both the label and the popcorn, reinforcing the seasonal theme.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a stylized cartoon illustration and does not include a realistic wooden surface. Instead, the background is plain white with minimal shading, and the objects appear to float or rest on an undefined plane. In contrast, Image A clearly shows the jars placed on a wooden cutting board. Since Image B lacks any visual cues of wood grain or texture associated with a wooden surface, it cannot be concluded that the scene is set on one.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no scattered kernels visible on the ground or surface surrounding the jar. The illustration focuses on the transformation process and final product placement in bowls. Unlike Image A, where loose kernels are scattered across the wooden surface, Image B omits this detail entirely. The clean, minimalist background emphasizes the characters and flow of the journey rather than environmental details.",
