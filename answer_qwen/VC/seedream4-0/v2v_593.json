      "question": "Does the Funko Pop figure retain the large hind legs characteristic of a kangaroo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure inside the box is stylized in a chibi (cute, exaggerated) design typical of Funko Pop collectibles. While real kangaroos have disproportionately large hind legs adapted for hopping, the Funko Pop version simplifies and proportions the body to fit the chibi aesthetic. The figure's hind legs are visible and appear larger than the front legs, which aligns with the general idea of kangaroo anatomy but is exaggerated and cartoonish. However, they are not proportionally as large or anatomically accurate as those of a real kangaroo. Given that the question asks if it 'retains' the characteristic, we must assess whether the key feature is present in a recognizable way. The hind legs are indeed emphasized and are larger than the front legs, so the trait is retained in a stylized form. Therefore, based on visual cues and knowledge of Funko Pop design conventions, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Is the long tail of the kangaroo preserved in the Funko Pop figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop figure inside the box shows a simplified, rounded design. In reality, kangaroos have long, muscular tails used for balance during hopping. In this chibi-style representation, the tail is absent or extremely shortened—only a small stub-like shape is visible at the back of the figure. This is consistent with how Funko Pop figures often omit or minimize anatomical features to maintain a cute, cartoonish appearance. Since the long tail is not preserved in the figure, despite being a defining feature of real kangaroos, the correct answer is no.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style kangaroo figure inside the box include a pouch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Kangaroos are marsupials, and females possess a pouch where they carry their young. In the chibi-style Funko Pop figure, there is a small, rounded area on the lower abdomen that resembles a pouch. It is depicted as a light-colored, slightly protruding section with a soft texture, consistent with the artistic interpretation of a marsupial pouch. Although it is stylized and not anatomically precise, the presence of this feature suggests an intentional inclusion of the pouch as a key characteristic of kangaroos. Thus, based on visual cues and world knowledge about marsupials and Funko Pop designs, the figure does include a pouch.",

      "question": "Is the Funko Pop figure primarily colored brown to reflect the original kangaroo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Real kangaroos typically have fur ranging from gray to reddish-brown. In Image B, the Funko Pop figure is predominantly a warm, orange-brown color, which closely matches the natural coloration of many kangaroo species. While the shade may be slightly more saturated or stylized for aesthetic appeal, the primary color choice reflects the real animal’s appearance. Additionally, the packaging and design use this color consistently across the figure, indicating an intentional effort to represent the animal accurately within the toy’s artistic style. Therefore, the figure is primarily brown to reflect the original kangaroo.",

      "question": "Are the hopping-related elements (hind legs and tail) depicted in the chibi-style figure inside the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Hopping in kangaroos relies heavily on powerful hind legs and a long tail for balance. In the chibi-style figure, the hind legs are visibly larger than the front legs, indicating an emphasis on this trait. However, the tail is significantly shortened or absent, which removes one of the key components involved in hopping. While the hind legs are represented in a way that suggests mobility and power, the lack of a functional-looking tail means that the full set of hopping-related elements is not fully preserved. Therefore, although some elements are included, the critical combination of both hind legs and tail is incomplete. Based on this analysis, the answer is no.",
