      "question": "Is the horse still present and interacting with the trailer in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is clearly visible and positioned on the ramp of the trailer. The horse's body is partially inside the trailer, with its front legs already stepped into the interior while the rear legs are still on the ramp. This indicates active interaction with the trailer, as the horse is in the process of being loaded. The presence of the horse is consistent with typical equestrian transport scenarios where horses are guided into trailers using ramps. The visual cues—such as the horse’s posture, the positioning of its legs, and the direction of movement—support the conclusion that the horse is indeed present and engaging with the trailer.",

      "question": "Are all three men still present and assisting the horse in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, three men are visible around the horse, each positioned in a way that suggests they are actively assisting in loading it into the trailer. One man is at the front, guiding the horse’s head; another is at the side, supporting the horse’s flank; and the third is near the rear, helping steady the back end. Their postures and hand placements indicate coordinated effort, which aligns with common practices for safely loading horses. Comparing this to Image A (the original), the number and positions of the men remain consistent, suggesting no changes in personnel or roles. Thus, all three men are still present and engaged in the task.",

      "question": "Is the horse still positioned on the ramp leading into the trailer in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse in Image B is clearly standing on the ramp, with its hind legs still on the ramp surface and its forelegs stepping into the trailer. The ramp is extended from the trailer door, providing a clear pathway. The positioning of the horse’s body confirms it is in the act of ascending the ramp. This matches standard procedures for loading horses, where the animal is guided up the ramp gradually. The visual evidence—such as the alignment of the horse’s legs and the angle of the ramp—supports that the horse remains on the ramp during the loading process.",

      "question": "Is the trailer's structure, including the ramp, still visible and intact in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trailer is fully visible, with its rear door open and the ramp deployed. The ramp appears structurally sound and securely attached to the trailer, allowing safe access for the horse. The trailer’s body, wheels, windows, and lighting fixtures are also visible and undamaged. The black-and-white filter does not obscure structural details, and there are no signs of deformation or missing components. This is consistent with typical horse trailers used in equestrian settings. When compared to Image A, the trailer’s structure remains unchanged, indicating that the editing process preserved the integrity of the vehicle.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all three men are wearing clothing typical of casual outdoor work: jeans, boots, and jackets or vests. The man on the left wears a long-sleeve shirt and jeans; the center man has a quilted vest over a plaid shirt with jeans; and the man on the right is in a jacket and jeans. These outfits are appropriate for handling horses and working outdoors, reflecting common equestrian attire. The monochrome filter affects color perception but does not alter clothing type. Comparing with Image A, the clothing remains consistent, confirming that their attire has not changed despite the editing process.",
