      "question": "Are there exactly four dragons, one in each quadrant of the cover?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central circular compass is surrounded by four dragon-like figures, each positioned in a distinct quadrant. These dragons are carved from wood and appear to be part of a larger puzzle-like arrangement. Each dragon occupies a separate quadrant around the central compass, suggesting a deliberate division into four sections. The visual layout shows one dragon per quadrant, with their bodies extending outward from the center. Based on the spatial distribution and design symmetry, it is reasonable to conclude that there are indeed four dragons, one in each quadrant.",

      "question": "Is there a central circular compass composed of concentric rings with inscribed characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central element in Image B is a circular wooden piece resembling a compass. It features multiple concentric rings, which are clearly visible due to the engraved lines. However, upon close inspection, there are no discernible inscriptions or characters within these rings. The rings are purely decorative or structural, lacking any textual content. Therefore, while the object has a concentric ring structure, it does not contain inscribed characters as described in the question.",

      "question": "Is there a star-shaped pointer located at the center of the compass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the center of the circular compass in Image B, there is a metallic-looking component with multiple arms radiating outward, forming a star-like shape. This pointer is consistent with traditional compass designs where directional indicators are used. The structure resembles a rosette or starburst pattern, typical of navigational or symbolic compasses. Given its position and form, it functions as a central pointer, aligning with the description in the question.",

      "question": "Are the dragons arranged symmetrically around the central compass, with each facing toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the placement of the dragons in Image B, they are positioned in a roughly symmetrical fashion around the central compass. Each dragon appears to be oriented such that its head is directed inward toward the center, creating a radial pattern. This arrangement is consistent with traditional artistic depictions where mythical creatures are placed in balanced, symmetrical layouts to emphasize harmony and focus on the central element. The uniformity in posture and direction supports the conclusion that the dragons are symmetrically arranged and facing inward.",

      "question": "Are the dragons separated by cross-shaped lines dividing the cover into four equal quadrants?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central compass is divided into four segments by straight lines that extend radially from the center, forming a cross-like pattern. These lines appear to separate the space into four quadrants, with each dragon occupying one quadrant. However, these lines are part of the compass itself rather than being physical divisions on the cover. The overall design suggests a conceptual separation, but the 'cross-shaped lines' are not distinct structural elements separating the dragons like borders. Instead, they are integral to the compass design. Thus, while there is a visual division into quadrants, the lines are not separate separators but components of the central motif.",

      "question": "Are there Chinese characters inscribed within the concentric rings of the central compass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the concentric rings of the central compass in Image B, there are no visible Chinese characters or any other script. The rings are marked with geometric patterns and lines, possibly indicating directions or divisions, but no textual inscriptions are present. This contrasts with traditional Chinese compasses (like the Luo Pan), which often feature inscriptions of Chinese characters related to directions, trigrams, or astrological symbols. In this image, the absence of text is clear, so the answer must reflect that no characters are inscribed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the dragons have coiled bodies with raised heads and extended claws, consistent with traditional Chinese dragon depictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each of the four dragons in Image B exhibits characteristics typical of traditional Chinese dragon art: elongated, coiled bodies with sinuous curves, raised heads with open mouths, and visible claws. These features align with classical representations of Chinese dragons, which are often depicted as powerful, serpentine creatures with expressive heads and dynamic postures. The carving style emphasizes movement and detail, including scales and limbs, reinforcing the authenticity of the depiction. Therefore, the dragons conform to well-known stylistic conventions in Chinese mythology and art.",
