    "Question": "Q1: Is the spiky, multi-tiered golden crown with a central peak and ornamental base present on the elephant’s head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's head is adorned with a highly detailed crown that features multiple pointed tiers rising upward, culminating in a central peak. The crown has an ornate base with decorative elements resembling filigree or embossed patterns, consistent with traditional royal or ceremonial headgear often seen in cultural artifacts from South or Southeast Asia. The material appears metallic and reflective, likely gold or gold-plated, and it fits snugly over the elephant’s forehead and top of the head. This matches the description of a 'spiky, multi-tiered golden crown with a central peak and ornamental base.' Based on visual cues and common design motifs in ceremonial animal statuary, this crown is clearly present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the elaborate golden chest armor with overlapping plates and intricate geometric/floral patterns present on the elephant’s torso?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the elephant wearing a complex piece of armor covering its chest and upper body. The armor consists of layered, overlapping plates made of a golden material, with visible etched designs that include both geometric shapes and floral-like motifs. These patterns are consistent with traditional Indian or Southeast Asian metalwork seen in royal war elephants or temple sculptures. The craftsmanship suggests symbolic protection and regality, typical of ceremonial depictions. The placement and structure match the description of 'elaborate golden chest armor with overlapping plates and intricate geometric/floral patterns,' confirming its presence.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are golden bands present around all four legs of the elephant, positioned just above the hooves?",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, each of the elephant’s four legs displays a distinct golden band encircling the lower part, just above the hoof area. These bands appear to be made of the same ornate, metallic material as the crown and chest armor, featuring textured detailing. The symmetry and uniformity across all limbs suggest intentional design, reinforcing their role as decorative elements. This aligns perfectly with the description provided in the question, indicating that such bands are indeed present on all four legs.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the elephant’s trunk curled upward in a distinct spiral shape?",
    "explanation": "The elephant’s trunk in Image B is visibly curved upward but does not form a complete spiral. Instead, it follows a gentle, smooth arc that ends in a slight curl at the tip. A spiral would involve multiple coils or turns, which is not observed here. The curvature is more akin to a graceful S-shape rather than a tightly wound spiral. Therefore, while the trunk is raised and curled, it lacks the distinct spiral structure described in the question.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the right tusk visible and protruding from the upper jaw of the elephant?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant’s right side (from the viewer’s perspective) shows a single tusk extending outward from the upper jaw. It is white, slightly curved, and clearly visible against the darker skin tone of the elephant. The tusk appears intact and properly aligned with the facial anatomy of an elephant. Given that the image is well-lit and the angle allows for clear visibility of the facial features, there is no ambiguity about the presence of the right tusk.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the elephant’s ears fully fanned out and extended laterally?",
    "explanation": "The elephant’s ears in Image B are large and spread wide, extending horizontally from the sides of the head. They appear fully unfurled, showing the full surface area including the inner folds and veins, which are typical of an alert or majestic pose. This posture is consistent with how elephants display dominance or attention, and in artistic representations, it often symbolizes grandeur. The lateral extension is evident, and there is no sign of folding or retraction, confirming they are fully fanned out.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are visible wrinkles present on the trunk, around the eyes, and at the joint areas of the legs?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the elephant with realistic textural details. The trunk shows deep, longitudinal wrinkles characteristic of elephant skin, especially near the base and along the length. Around the eyes, fine creases are visible, adding depth and expression. At the joints of the legs—particularly the knees and ankles—there are pronounced folds and wrinkling, consistent with natural elephant anatomy. These features enhance the lifelike quality of the sculpture and reflect accurate biological representation. Thus, wrinkles are clearly visible in all specified regions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
