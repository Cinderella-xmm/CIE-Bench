      "question": "Is the chibi character depicted in a skateboarding pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character is shown standing on a skateboard with one foot placed forward and the other slightly behind, arms extended to the sides for balance. This posture is characteristic of a person actively skateboarding, particularly performing a maneuver or maintaining balance while riding. The presence of motion lines beneath the skateboard further suggests movement, reinforcing the idea that the character is engaged in skateboarding. Based on common visual conventions in cartoon depictions of skateboarding, this pose is consistent with a typical skateboarding stance.",

      "question": "Does the chibi character have an oversized head relative to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In chibi art style, characters are typically drawn with exaggerated proportions, most notably an oversized head compared to the body. In this image, the character's head is significantly larger than its torso and limbs, which is a hallmark of the chibi aesthetic. This stylistic choice is used to emphasize cuteness and expressiveness. Given that the head occupies a large portion of the figure’s overall height and the body appears smaller in comparison, this confirms the use of chibi proportions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character is clearly depicted wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt and shorts. The T-shirt is uniformly gray in color, and the shorts are also gray, matching the clothing style commonly seen in casual cartoon characters. These garments are simple and consistent with typical attire for a young boy engaging in outdoor activities like skateboarding. The color and design align with standard representations in children's cartoons.",

      "question": "Is there a simplified cartoon-style skateboard present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skateboard in the image has a stylized, simplified design typical of cartoon illustrations. It features basic shapes—rectangular deck with rounded ends, visible wheels, and minimal detailing such as a few colored spots on the top surface. There are no realistic textures or complex components like trucks or grip tape details. This minimalist approach is common in animated or chibi-style artwork where realism is sacrificed for clarity and charm. Therefore, it qualifies as a simplified cartoon-style skateboard.",

      "question": "Is the background replaced with a hand-drawn city skyline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background consists of a series of tall buildings rendered in black-and-white line art, resembling a city skyline. The drawing style is sketch-like, with clean outlines and no shading or color fill, suggesting it was hand-drawn rather than photorealistic. The buildings vary in height and shape, including skyscrapers with spires, which resemble iconic urban architecture. This artistic choice creates a contrast between the colorful, detailed character and the monochrome, sketched environment—a common technique in illustrated scenes to emphasize the subject. Thus, the background is indeed a hand-drawn city skyline.",
