      "question": "Does the mirror retain its rectangular shape with illuminated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror is clearly visible and maintains a rectangular form. Its edges are illuminated with a soft, even glow, which suggests integrated lighting along the perimeter. This design is common in modern bathroom mirrors to enhance visibility and aesthetic appeal. The illumination appears consistent around all four sides, confirming that the mirror retains both its rectangular shape and illuminated edges. Based on visual cues and common design practices for such mirrors, this feature is preserved.",

      "question": "Is the bowl-style vessel sink still present on the countertop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sink in Image B is a white, rounded vessel placed directly on the wooden countertop. It matches the typical appearance of a bowl-style vessel sinkâ€”elevated above the surface, with no integration into the countertop. Its smooth, curved form and placement confirm it is indeed a bowl-style vessel sink. There are no signs of replacement or removal, so it remains present as in the original setup.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the left side of the image, a matte black towel rack is mounted horizontally on the wall. It has a simple, minimalist design with two square brackets supporting a straight bar. A gray towel is draped over it, indicating it is functional and securely in place. The color and finish match the description of a matte black rack, and there is no indication of movement or removal. Therefore, the towel rack remains attached.",

      "question": "Are the decorative vase with branches and small bottle still arranged on the countertop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the right side of the countertop, a white ribbed vase containing dried branches is clearly visible. Next to it is a small amber-colored bottle, likely a soap or lotion dispenser. These items are positioned neatly and remain unchanged in their arrangement. Their presence and placement are consistent with typical bathroom decor elements, and they appear undisturbed. Thus, both objects are still present and arranged as before.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vanity unit in Image B is located directly beneath the mirror, aligning centrally with it. It features a clean, modern design with a white cabinet base and a light-toned wooden countertop. The material and color of the countertop match those of a natural wood finish, while the cabinet doors are flat and white, consistent with contemporary bathroom furniture. The structure appears intact and properly installed, with no signs of displacement or alteration. This confirms that the vanity unit is correctly positioned and retains its original materials and design.",
