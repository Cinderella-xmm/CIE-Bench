      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is wearing a bright red headscarf that wraps around her head and drapes down at the back.

The placement of the band is consistent with cultural headwear styles seen in West African communities, such as those from Ghana or Nigeria. The visual details, including texture and color contrast, are clear and match typical craftsmanship of such accessories. Based on world knowledge of traditional attire and visual inspection, this element is both present and accurately rendered.",

Her eyes are almond-shaped, and she wears a small, round earring in her left ear. A subtle, warm smile is visible, conveying grace and dignity. These features are preserved with high fidelity despite the stylized framing of the image. The lighting enhances facial contours without distorting proportions, ensuring all key attributes remain clearly visible and true to form.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

Her right hand supports the base while her left hand rests on the rim, mirroring a stable and respectful posture often seen in ceremonial contexts. Comparing with Image A (the original), the same hand positioning and body orientation are maintained. This consistency suggests that the edit preserved the original pose, even though the background and framing have been altered. The posture reflects cultural reverence, and its retention indicates careful preservation of intent.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the black long-sleeve garment is clearly visible beneath the blue vest in Image B. The sleeves extend from under the armholes of the vest, and their dark color contrasts with the vibrant blue fabric. This layering is typical in traditional African attire, where inner garments provide modesty and structure. The visibility of the sleeves confirms that the underlying clothing was not obscured during editing, preserving both authenticity and detail.",

These elements are evenly spaced and symmetrically placed, consistent with traditional textile weaving techniques. The colors are vivid and accurately reflect the original palette. No noticeable distortions or shifts in pattern alignment are observed, indicating faithful reproduction. Such motifs are common in Kente or Adinkra-inspired fabrics, reinforcing the authenticity of the representation.",

Its position is balanced between her hands, and it remains level, not tilted. This horizontal and central placement emphasizes symmetry and respect, common in ceremonial presentations. The framing of the image ensures the bowl is visually prominent and properly aligned with the subject’s body. Compared to Image A, the positioning is consistent, confirming intentional preservation of the original composition.",
