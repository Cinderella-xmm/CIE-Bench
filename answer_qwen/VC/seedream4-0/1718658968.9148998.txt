    "Question": "Q1: Are the two tall towers positioned symmetrically on either side of the central section?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the two towers are constructed from wooden blocks and appear to be placed on either side of a central structure. Observing their alignment, both towers are of equal height and width, and they are equidistant from the central arched doorway. The symmetry is visually balanced, with identical staircases leading up to the entrance from both sides. This suggests a deliberate symmetrical design, which is common in architectural models or toy constructions aiming for aesthetic balance. Based on visual cues and typical design principles in such block-built structures, the towers are indeed symmetrically positioned.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a centrally located arched doorway with a wooden door beneath a rounded arch?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central part of the structure features an arched opening that is clearly defined by a rounded top. Inside this arch, a wooden door is visible, made from the same material as the rest of the structure, with a dark handle. The door is centered between the two towers, and its placement under the rounded arch confirms the presence of a classic arched doorway. This design is consistent with traditional castle architecture and matches the visual details seen here.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does a set of stone steps ascend from the water level directly to the arched entrance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is placed on a wooden table, not near any body of water. There is no water present in the scene, and therefore no steps ascending from a water level. The steps shown are made of wood and lead up from the tabletop to the arched entrance. Since there is no water, the condition described in the question cannot be met. This conclusion is based on direct observation of the environment in Image B and the absence of any aquatic feature.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are there multiple rectangular windows with dark frames aligned vertically on each tower?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the towers are made of wooden blocks, and while there are openings in the towers, they are not detailed with dark frames or multiple rectangular windows. Instead, the towers have simple cutouts or recesses that resemble windows but lack distinct frames or vertical alignment. The design is minimalist, focusing on geometric shapes rather than realistic window features. Therefore, the presence of multiple rectangular windows with dark frames is not accurate in this image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the tops of both towers feature flat surfaces with crenellated edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tops of both towers are constructed with interlocking wooden blocks that form a pattern resembling battlements. These patterns include alternating raised and recessed sections, mimicking crenellations found in real castles. The edges are not smooth but have a stepped, zigzag appearance characteristic of crenellated designs. While not made of stone, the block construction clearly imitates this architectural feature. Thus, the towers do have crenellated edges at the top.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a low stone wall extending horizontally from the right side of the castle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is composed entirely of wooden blocks, and there is no evidence of a low stone wall extending from the right side. The right tower ends abruptly without any horizontal extension, and the surrounding area is open, showing only the wooden surface of the table. Unlike the original image (Image A), which may have included such a wall, Image B lacks this feature entirely. The materials and construction style do not support the presence of a stone wall, confirming its absence.",
    "answer": "No"
