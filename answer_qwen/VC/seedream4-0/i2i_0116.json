      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is clearly visible within a transparent display case. The costume features a predominantly black tunic, which is consistent with the character's iconic outfit. Upon closer inspection, gold detailing is present along the chest and shoulders, as well as green accents on the shoulder guards and trim around the collar and sleeves. These elements match the known design of the character's attire from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The materials appear to be sculpted with high fidelity, replicating the texture and color scheme accurately. Based on visual evidence and knowledge of the character’s costume design, the figurine retains these specific color and detail features.",

      "question": "Does the figurine maintain the character's long, slicked-back brown hairstyle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B shows a detailed representation of the character's head and hair. The hair is long, extending past the shoulders, and styled in a slicked-back manner, characteristic of the character’s appearance in the films. The color appears to be dark brown or black, consistent with the actor’s portrayal. This hairstyle is a defining feature of the character, and its accurate replication in the figurine suggests attention to detail in the sculpting process. Given the visual cues and prior knowledge of the character’s look, the hairstyle is faithfully reproduced.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the posture of the figurine in Image B, both arms are positioned across the chest, with one forearm resting over the other. This pose mirrors the iconic stance often associated with the character in promotional imagery and film scenes. The positioning of the arms is symmetrical and deliberate, indicating intentional design to reflect a recognizable pose. The articulation of the arms and hands supports this interpretation, and it aligns with known depictions of the character in similar stances. Therefore, the figurine is indeed shown with arms crossed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine’s forearms are adorned with gold-colored bracers that extend from the wrists up toward the elbows. These bracers have intricate patterns, matching the ornate style seen in the character’s cinematic costume. Additionally, the shoulder area features green shoulder guards with gold trim, which are clearly visible and consistent with the character’s armor design. These elements are key components of the character’s outfit and are accurately represented in the figurine. The presence of both gold bracers and green shoulder guards confirms their inclusion.",

      "question": "Does the figurine include a black cape as part of the costume?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B displays a long, flowing garment that drapes down from the back and sides, resembling a cape. However, upon closer inspection, the fabric appears to be integrated into the main tunic rather than a separate detachable cape. The material flows seamlessly from the shoulders and back, but there is no distinct separation or flaring typical of a standalone cape. In contrast, in Image A (the original image), the character wears a full black cape that extends outward. While the figurine captures the silhouette of a cape-like element, it lacks the full volume and independence of an actual cape. Therefore, based on visual analysis and comparison with known costume designs, the figurine does not fully include a separate black cape.",
