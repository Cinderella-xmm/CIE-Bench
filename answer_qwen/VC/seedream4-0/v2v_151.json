      "question": "Does the tiger retain its distinctive stripe pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger is depicted in a stylized, cartoonish form with exaggerated features. Despite the artistic style, the tiger clearly has dark stripes on its orange fur, which are consistent with the natural stripe pattern of real tigers. These stripes are visible across its body, including its limbs and tail, confirming that the distinctive stripe pattern is preserved, albeit in a simplified and stylized manner. This aligns with common knowledge that tigers are characterized by their unique black or dark brown stripes on an orange background. The artistic rendering does not eliminate this key identifying feature.",

      "question": "Is the tiger still holding the skateboard in its paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger is standing upright on one skateboard while holding another skateboard in its front paws. The positioning of the paws around the grip tape area of the skateboard indicates that it is actively holding it. This is consistent with the visual cue of grasping, even though the tiger's posture is more dynamic than in the original image. Based on world knowledge, holding an object typically involves gripping it with the hands (or paws), and here the tiger’s claws are wrapped around the board, confirming that it is indeed holding the skateboard.",

      "question": "Does the skateboard still display the yin-yang symbol on its underside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard being held by the tiger clearly shows a circular symbol on its underside. The symbol consists of two swirling sections—one black and one white—each containing a dot of the opposite color. This is the universally recognized yin-yang symbol, representing balance and duality in Chinese philosophy. The symbol is centered on the deck, just as it appears in the original image. Therefore, despite the change in artistic style and setting, the yin-yang symbol remains present and accurately depicted.",

      "question": "Is the tiger still wearing the military-style cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger is wearing a dark green cap with a red star emblem on the front, which is characteristic of a military-style hat, commonly associated with certain historical or symbolic uniforms. The cap has a brim and a band around it, matching the design seen in Image A. Even though the overall art style is more cartoonish and rounded, the cap retains all essential features of a military-style hat. This confirms that the tiger is still wearing such a cap, maintaining continuity with the original image in terms of accessories.",

      "question": "Does the tiger maintain a seated posture similar to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger is standing upright on one skateboard, with its legs positioned as if balancing, and its other paw holding a second skateboard. This is a dynamic, active pose, contrasting sharply with the seated posture seen in Image A, where the tiger is sitting calmly and facing forward. The difference in posture reflects a shift from a contemplative, static position to an energetic, playful stance. Based on visual analysis and world knowledge about animal postures, standing on a skateboard implies movement and balance, which is incompatible with a seated posture. Thus, the tiger does not maintain the same seated posture.",
