      "question": "Is the red-and-white vertically striped jersey with a white collar still present on the boy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy is wearing a jersey that features vertical red and white stripes, consistent with traditional football kits from the mid-20th century. The collar of the jersey is clearly white, matching the classic design of vintage football shirts. This visual detail aligns with common historical football attire, particularly reminiscent of styles worn in the 1960s. There is no indication of any alteration to the jersey’s pattern or color scheme in this image. The presence of the white collar is especially notable as it is a distinctive feature of such vintage kits.",

      "question": "Is the classic black-and-white paneled soccer ball still under the boy’s foot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The soccer ball beneath the boy's foot in Image B displays the traditional black pentagonal and white hexagonal panel design, which is iconic for footballs used historically, especially during the 1960s and 1970s. Despite the overall reddish tint applied to the image (likely for stylistic or retro magazine cover effect), the ball retains its recognizable pattern. The shape and arrangement of the panels are consistent with the Adidas Telstar design, which became standard after the 1970 World Cup but was already widely recognized in earlier decades. Thus, even with the color overlay, the ball's identity remains clear.",

      "question": "Is the boy’s left leg raised while his right foot remains in contact with the soccer ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the boy’s posture in Image B, his left leg is lifted high, bent at the knee, indicating a dynamic pose typical of a player balancing or preparing to move. His right foot is firmly placed on top of the soccer ball, maintaining control. This positioning suggests balance and motion, consistent with a skilled footballer demonstrating control. The shadow cast also supports this stance, showing the weight distribution on the right side. This pose matches the action depicted in many vintage sports illustrations where players are shown in mid-motion.",

      "question": "Are the red socks with white cuffs visible on both legs of the boy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both of the boy’s legs show long red socks with distinct white cuffs near the top. The sock on the left leg (raised) is fully visible, and the one on the right leg (on the ground) is also clearly seen despite being partially obscured by the shoe. The white cuff is a characteristic feature of traditional football socks from the era suggested by the poster style. Even with the red tint affecting the image, the contrast between the red and white remains discernible, confirming their presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boy’s face is fully visible in Image B, and he is smiling broadly, showing teeth, which conveys enthusiasm and confidence. His gaze is directed slightly to the side but still generally toward the viewer, creating a sense of engagement. The facial features are well-defined, and the lighting highlights his expression effectively. This portrayal is consistent with promotional or celebratory imagery often used in vintage sports magazines to convey heroism and joy.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A dark shadow is clearly visible on the green field directly beneath the boy, extending slightly to the left. The shadow mirrors his body posture—especially the raised leg and the position of the ball—indicating consistent lighting from above and to the right. Shadows like this are typical in outdoor scenes under bright sunlight, and their inclusion adds depth and realism to the illustration. Even though the image has a stylized, aged appearance, the shadow remains intact and coherent with the scene’s lighting logic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The football field beneath the players is distinctly green, with white boundary lines marking the pitch. These lines include the center line, penalty area, and goal lines, all clearly drawn and consistent with standard football field markings. Despite the red overlay tone applied across the entire image for aesthetic purposes (to mimic an old magazine cover), the green color of the field and the white lines remain visible and distinguishable. This indicates that the field layout is preserved, even if slightly altered in hue due to the editing style.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the background of Image B, several other players are visible on the field. Some are wearing red-and-white vertically striped jerseys, matching the main subject’s kit, suggesting they are teammates. Others are wearing different colored kits—one in blue and another in plain white—indicating opposing teams or different roles (e.g., goalkeeper). This variety reflects a typical match scenario. Although the image has a stylized, retro look, the figures and their clothing remain identifiable, supporting the presence of multiple players in varied uniforms.",
