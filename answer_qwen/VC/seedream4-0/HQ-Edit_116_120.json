      "question": "Is the flag positioned at the top of the tallest central spire of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle is enclosed within a glass dome and placed on a wooden base labeled 'Empire of the Shores'. The flag is visible at the very top of the structure, mounted on a pole. Observing the architectural layout, the tallest spire appears to be centrally located, rising higher than the surrounding turrets. The flag is indeed affixed to the apex of this central spire, which aligns with typical design conventions where flags are placed on the highest point for visibility. This positioning is consistent with both aesthetic symmetry and functional display. There is no visual indication that the flag is on a secondary or off-center tower.",

      "question": "Are there two spiral staircases symmetrically positioned on either side of the central entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central entrance of the sandcastle features an arched doorway. On either side of this entrance, there are curved staircases leading upward. These staircases are designed in a flowing, spiral-like manner and appear to mirror each other in shape and placement. They are not straight but have a gentle helical curve, suggesting they are spiral staircases. Their symmetrical arrangement relative to the central axis supports the conclusion that they are symmetrically positioned. This design enhances the aesthetic balance of the structure, a common feature in fantasy or decorative architecture.",

      "question": "Is there a central arched doorway with ornate latticework directly above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central entrance of the sandcastle clearly features an arched doorway. Directly above this arch, there is a detailed pattern resembling latticework or filigree, carved into the sand material. This decorative element is consistent with ornamental design seen in Gothic or fantasy-inspired architecture. The presence of such intricate detailing above the main entrance is both visually prominent and structurally coherent with the overall design theme of the castle. This latticework adds depth and complexity to the facade, enhancing its grandeur.",

      "question": "Are there at least seven conical turrets visible around the perimeter of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle is surrounded by multiple conical turrets. Counting them carefully, there are several distinct turrets arranged around the structure. Starting from the front and moving clockwise, we can identify at least eight conical turrets—some are more prominent due to their height and position, while others are smaller but still clearly defined. All of these turrets have a pointed, cone-shaped top, characteristic of traditional castle design. Since the count exceeds seven, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Are starfish and seashells visibly present around the base of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the sandcastle inside the snow globe contains small decorative elements. Scattered across the sandy foundation are various seashells of different shapes and sizes, including spiral shells and scallop shells. Additionally, there are two starfish visible—one near the left side and another toward the center-right. These marine elements are commonly used in beach-themed decorations and reinforce the coastal motif of the sandcastle. Their inclusion is intentional and clearly visible.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sandcastle designed with bilateral symmetry along its central vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle exhibits a high degree of bilateral symmetry. When observing the structure from the front, the left and right sides mirror each other in terms of turret placement, staircase design, and architectural details. For example, the two spiral staircases are identical in form and position on either side of the central entrance. The towers and arches are also mirrored, indicating careful planning to maintain symmetry. This balance is typical of formal architectural designs and enhances the visual appeal of the model. Therefore, the sandcastle adheres to bilateral symmetry.",

      "question": "Are there decorative carvings visible on the surfaces of the towers and archways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the sandcastle's towers and archways display intricate patterns and textures. These include geometric designs, floral motifs, and lattice-like structures that resemble carvings. Such detailing is particularly evident on the walls adjacent to the arches and along the bases of the turrets. These decorative elements are consistent with the craftsmanship expected in a miniature artistic representation of a sandcastle. The level of detail suggests deliberate carving or molding to enhance realism and aesthetic value.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central spire of the sandcastle rises higher than all surrounding turrets. It is positioned directly above the main entrance and is the most prominent vertical feature. Its height surpasses that of the flanking towers, making it the tallest structure in the composition. This central placement and dominance in height are consistent with architectural principles where the tallest tower often serves as a focal point. The flag atop this tower further emphasizes its significance. Therefore, the tallest tower is indeed located at the center.",
