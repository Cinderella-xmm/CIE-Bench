    "Question": "Q1: Does the zebra retain its black-and-white striped pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is depicted as a stylized, cartoonish figure with exaggerated features such as large eyes and a rounded body. Despite the artistic style, the zebra still displays the characteristic black-and-white striped pattern across its body, including its head, legs, and torso. This pattern is consistent with real zebras, which are known for their unique striping. The stripes are clearly visible and follow the typical alternating black and white design, even though they are simplified for the cartoon aesthetic. Therefore, based on visual analysis and knowledge of zebra appearance, the zebra retains its iconic striped pattern.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the cake retain its zebra-striped design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is shown with a decorative design that mimics the black-and-white striped pattern of a zebra. The stripes are evenly spaced and run horizontally around the cake, matching the aesthetic theme of the image. This design choice aligns with the overall zebra motif present in both the character and the scene. Although the cake is stylized and appears to be made of fondant or similar material, the zebra-stripe pattern is clearly preserved. Thus, based on visual evidence and thematic consistency, the cake retains its zebra-striped design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the zebra still leaning forward toward the cake?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is positioned in a seated posture, leaning slightly forward with its front paws resting near the cake. Its head is angled downward, directed toward the cake, suggesting an intent to interact with it. This posture mirrors the behavior seen in Image A, where the zebra leans in toward the cake. However, in Image B, the zebra's movement is more playful and cartoonish, but the directional orientation toward the cake remains consistent. Therefore, based on spatial positioning and behavioral cues, the zebra is still leaning forward toward the cake.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a single lit candle on the cake?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cake has a small figurine of a zebra placed on top instead of a candle. There is no visible flame or candlestick, unlike in Image A where a single lit yellow candle is present. The absence of a candle and the presence of a zebra figurine indicate that the original candle has been replaced. This change suggests a shift in the sceneâ€™s focus from celebration (implied by the candle) to a more whimsical or decorative representation. Based on visual inspection, there is no lit candle on the cake in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the cake placed on a table surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is presented on a white plate, which is resting on what appears to be a flat, horizontal surface resembling a table. The background shows greenery, suggesting an outdoor setting, but the cake's placement on a stable surface supports the interpretation of a table. While the surface is not explicitly labeled, its flatness and positioning beneath the plate are consistent with a table. Comparing this to Image A, where the cake is also on a wooden table, the function and context remain similar. Therefore, based on visual cues and common object placement logic, the cake is indeed placed on a table surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
