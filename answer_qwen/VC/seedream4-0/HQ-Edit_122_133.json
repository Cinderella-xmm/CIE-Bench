      "question": "Is the cardinal’s body predominantly bright red with a black facial mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal is depicted as a stylized, anthropomorphic figure dressed in a red and cream-colored gown. Despite the costume, the bird's natural features are still recognizable: its head and upper body retain the characteristic bright red coloration of a male northern cardinal. The area around its eyes and beak is distinctly black, forming a facial mask that is typical of this species. This matches real-world biological knowledge of cardinals, where males have vivid red plumage and a black mask around the face. Therefore, even though it is dressed in clothing, the underlying bird retains these key visual traits.",

      "question": "Does the blue jay have a blue crest and wings with alternating blue and white bars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue jay is also anthropomorphized, wearing a blue and cream dress. However, its natural features are preserved. The bird has a prominent blue crest, consistent with the appearance of a real blue jay. Its wings, visible beneath the costume, display a pattern of alternating blue and white bars, which aligns with the natural wing markings of blue jays. These patterns are a known feature of the species, especially on the secondary flight feathers. Thus, despite the attire, the bird's physical characteristics match the description.",

      "question": "Is there visible snow resting on the cardinal’s head and back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal is positioned inside a diorama with a snowy scene. While the bird itself is clothed in a detailed outfit, the top of its head (the crest) appears to have a slight accumulation of snow or frost-like texture, consistent with the wintry setting. However, due to the elaborate costume, much of the bird's back is covered, and no clear snow is visible on the actual feathers. In contrast, in Image A, the cardinal clearly has snow on its head and back. Since the question refers only to Image B, and the snow is not visibly present on the bird's body beyond subtle effects on the crest, the answer must reflect what is directly observable. There is no definitive snow on the cardinal’s back or head in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the blue jay have a black beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue jay is shown with a dark, pointed beak that is clearly black in color. This matches the real-world anatomy of blue jays, which have strong, black beaks adapted for cracking seeds and nuts. Even though the bird is dressed in a costume, the beak remains exposed and maintains its natural color. This observation is consistent across both images, but in Image B, the black beak is clearly visible and unobscured by any elements.",

      "question": "Are the birds perched on snow-covered pine branches with visible needles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal is standing on a platform inside a glass case that simulates a winter scene. The base includes artificial snow and icicles, but the bird is not perched on a natural branch. Instead, it stands on a flat, icy surface. Similarly, the blue jay is positioned on a wooden floor within a small house-like structure, surrounded by decorative evergreen sprigs, but not on a real pine branch. While pine needles are present in the background decor, neither bird is actually perched on a snow-covered pine branch with visible needles. This contrasts with Image A, where both birds are realistically perched on such branches. Based solely on Image B, the answer must reflect the absence of actual perch branches.",

      "question": "Does the cardinal have an orange-red beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal’s beak is clearly visible and colored in a shade of orange-red, which is consistent with the natural appearance of a northern cardinal’s beak. Cardinals typically have bright orange-red beaks, which are strong and conical, adapted for seed-eating. The beak in this image, although part of a stylized representation, accurately reflects this trait. The coloration is distinct from the black beak of the blue jay and matches the expected morphology of the species.",

      "question": "Are the cardinal and blue jay positioned in separate vertical sections of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is divided into two distinct compartments: the left side contains the cardinal in a glass-fronted cabinet with a snowy, icy interior, while the right side shows the blue jay in a wooden-framed doorway resembling a miniature house. These two sections are separated vertically by a central divider, and each bird occupies its own space. This arrangement mirrors the layout in Image A, where the birds are also split vertically. However, in Image B, the division is more structural—each bird is in a different room or display case—making their separation clear. The vertical alignment and spatial separation confirm that they are indeed in separate vertical sections.",
