    "Question": "Q1: Does the plastic figurine still hold a hammer that glows with blue lightning?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is clearly holding a hammer in its right hand. The hammer emits bright blue light and visible lightning effects, which are consistent with Thor's iconic weapon, Mjolnir, as it is often depicted in movies and media—especially when activated. The glow and lightning are not merely visual effects overlaid on the image but appear to be part of the figurine’s design, possibly enhanced digitally to simulate energy emission. This aligns with common portrayals of Thor where his hammer channels lightning. Based on visual cues such as the luminous blue color and crackling electric arcs, the hammer indeed glows with blue lightning.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the detailed black armor with metallic and gold accents retained on the figurine?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the figurine wearing a suit of armor that closely matches Thor’s typical cinematic appearance. The armor is primarily black with intricate gold and silver metallic details, including circular shoulder plates, chest plating, and decorative trim along the torso and limbs. These features are consistent with the detailed design seen in Thor’s MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) costume. The material appears to be molded plastic with painted finishes to simulate metal textures. The level of detail, including embossed patterns and layered components, indicates that the armor has been faithfully reproduced. Thus, the detailed black armor with metallic and gold accents is retained.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the figurine still wear a red cape draped over the shoulders?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a red fabric element is visible extending from the back of the figurine’s shoulders and flowing downward behind it. This element matches the description of Thor’s signature red cape. The way it drapes over the shoulders and hangs down suggests it is designed to mimic the dynamic flow seen in live-action depictions. While it may be slightly stiff due to being made of plastic or cloth attached to a figure, its placement and color confirm it is the same red cape. Therefore, the figurine does wear a red cape draped over the shoulders.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the figurine retain Thor's beard and long blond hair?",
    "explanation": "The figurine in Image B features a sculpted face with a full beard and long, wavy blond hair that flows down past the shoulders. These characteristics are consistent with the well-known portrayal of Thor in recent films, particularly those featuring Chris Hemsworth. The hair is styled in a manner that mimics natural movement, and the beard is detailed enough to resemble facial hair texture. Since both features are present and accurately represent Thor’s appearance, the figurine retains these traits.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the figurine maintain the same standing pose as depicted in the original image?",
    "explanation": "To evaluate this, we compare the poses in Image A and Image B. In Image A, Thor stands with his left arm slightly forward and his right arm holding the hammer downward, facing forward with a confident stance. In Image B, the figurine also stands upright with the hammer held in the right hand, but the left arm is more relaxed and slightly bent at the elbow, while the body orientation is nearly identical. However, subtle differences exist: the head tilt and exact positioning of the limbs are not perfectly aligned. Moreover, the figurine is posed on a base with a glowing ring, suggesting a static display pose rather than a dynamic one. While the overall posture is similar—standing tall, facing forward, hammer in hand—the precise alignment and limb angles differ slightly. Therefore, while the general pose is maintained, it is not an exact replication of the original image’s stance.",
    "answer": "No"
