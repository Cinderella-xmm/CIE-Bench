      "question": "Does the edited image retain the girl’s short, straight black bob hairstyle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl has a short, straight black bob hairstyle that closely matches the style seen in the original image. The hair is neatly cut, falls just above her shoulders, and maintains a clean, uniform shape. This is consistent with typical representations of traditional Japanese children's hairstyles, especially in stylized or anime-inspired art. The visual cues—such as the length, texture, and silhouette—confirm that the hairstyle has been preserved in the edit. There are no signs of alteration such as longer hair, curls, or additional accessories.",

      "question": "Is the red flower still held in the girl’s left hand in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is holding a red pom-pom-like flower in her left hand. Her posture shows the hand extended slightly forward, and the flower is clearly visible in her left grip. This aligns with common visual storytelling conventions where objects are positioned to draw attention and balance composition. In contrast to real-world physics, this positioning remains consistent with the original image. No evidence suggests the flower has been moved to the right hand or omitted entirely. Therefore, the placement is preserved.",

      "question": "Are the wave and floral patterns visible in the kimono’s fabric in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kimono in Image B displays vivid, colorful patterns that include swirling motifs resembling waves and floral designs. These patterns are rendered in bright hues like orange, blue, yellow, and purple, which are characteristic of traditional Japanese textile art. Although the style is more cartoonish and stylized than realistic, the presence of wave-like curves and flower shapes is unmistakable. This reflects both artistic interpretation and cultural accuracy, as kimonos often feature nature-inspired patterns. The design is clearly intentional and detailed enough to confirm visibility.",

      "question": "Are the vendor trays arranged symmetrically on both sides of the alley in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vendor trays are lined up along both sides of the alleyway, forming two parallel rows. While there is some variation in tray size and content, the overall layout appears balanced and symmetrical from the viewer's perspective. This symmetry is a common compositional technique in visual media to create harmony and guide focus toward the central figure. The arrangement mirrors the structure seen in many traditional market scenes, suggesting deliberate design. Despite minor differences in color distribution, the alignment and spacing support the conclusion of symmetry.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor in Image B consists of rectangular tiles laid out in a regular, repeating grid pattern. The tiles are uniformly gray, consistent with typical urban or market flooring materials. This design choice enhances the sense of depth and order in the scene, which is common in both real-world architecture and animated environments. The grid pattern is clearly visible and uninterrupted, indicating careful planning in the artwork. There are no deviations such as irregular shapes or colors, confirming the description.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, vertical banners with Japanese characters are visible beneath the rows of lanterns. These banners are attached to the sides of the market stalls and display black calligraphic text on light-colored backgrounds. The presence of these banners is consistent with traditional Japanese festival settings, where signage often indicates stall names or offerings. Although the text may be stylized or fictional, its form and placement match the original image, indicating continuity in cultural representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The girl is placed directly in the center of the alleyway, equidistant from the trays on both sides. Her position creates a focal point in the composition, drawing the viewer’s eye down the corridor formed by the market stalls. This central placement is a common narrative device in visual art to emphasize the subject. The symmetry of the surrounding elements further supports her central location, reinforcing the idea that she is the primary figure in the scene.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Above the alleyway in Image B, there are multiple rows of hanging objects, including orange lanterns and colorful balloons. These items are arranged in parallel lines, creating a festive canopy over the market. The combination of lanterns and balloons adds to the celebratory atmosphere, which is typical of Japanese festivals. The alignment is orderly and continuous, suggesting intentional decoration. This setup is consistent with both cultural practices and visual storytelling techniques used in animated scenes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On both sides of the alley in Image B, there are individuals seated behind the trays, appearing to manage or sell goods. These figures are depicted in various poses, some leaning forward, others standing slightly, but all positioned behind their respective stalls. Their presence contributes to the bustling market atmosphere and reflects real-world vendor behavior. The depiction is consistent across both sides, supporting the idea that vendors are present on each side of the alley.",

These colors are clearly differentiated and arranged in separate compartments, enhancing the visual appeal of the market scene. Such colorful displays are common in Japanese festivals, particularly for snacks like candied fruits or sweets. The vibrancy and clarity of the colors suggest an emphasis on detail and aesthetic richness, typical of stylized illustrations.",
