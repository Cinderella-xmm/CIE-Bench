      "question": "Is the pile of diced vegetables on the left side of the image orange in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pile of diced vegetables on the left side of Image B is composed of uniformly colored orange cubes. Based on visual cues, these cubes resemble diced carrots, which are commonly orange in color. The consistent orange hue across all pieces supports this identification. Even though the image has a stylized, low-poly art effect, the dominant color remains clearly orange. This aligns with common knowledge that carrots are typically orange when diced and used in cooking.",

      "question": "Do the green vegetable pieces in the center of the image have a curved, C-shaped form with a visible hollow center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green vegetable pieces in the center of Image B are rendered in a stylized, geometric manner but still retain a recognizable shape. They appear as curved segments with a distinct hollow or central cavity, resembling cross-sections of celery stalks. Celery, when cut into small pieces, often displays a hollow, tubular structure with a C-like curvature. Despite the artistic distortion, the form remains consistent with this anatomical feature. The presence of multiple such shapes reinforces the interpretation that they are stylized representations of celery slices.",

      "question": "Are the diced vegetables on the right side of the image pale white or translucent in appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pile of diced vegetables on the right side of Image B consists of small, cube-shaped pieces that are light in color, appearing pale white with subtle shading that suggests translucency. This visual characteristic is typical of diced onions, especially when freshly cut. Onions have a semi-transparent quality due to their cellular structure, and this is reflected even in the stylized rendering. The uniformity of the pale color and slight luminosity support the conclusion that these are intended to represent onions.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a knife with a metallic blade and black handle located in the upper right portion of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large knife is positioned diagonally in the upper right area. The blade is silver-colored and reflective, consistent with a metallic material such as stainless steel. The handle is dark, appearing black, and features a circular rivet, which is typical for kitchen knives. This design matches common culinary knives used for chopping vegetables. The placement and appearance are coherent with typical kitchen tool representation, even within the stylized context.",

      "question": "Is the surface beneath the vegetables and knife a wooden cutting board with visible horizontal grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface in Image B shows a textured background with linear patterns running horizontally, mimicking wood grain. The coloration is warm brown, typical of wooden cutting boards. Although the style is abstract and polygonal, the overall texture and pattern suggest a wooden surface. The horizontal alignment of the lines supports the interpretation of a wooden board with visible grain. This is consistent with standard kitchen tools and surfaces used for food preparation.",

      "question": "Are the three piles of vegetables arranged in a triangular pattern with carrots on the left, celery in the middle, and onions on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three piles of vegetables are grouped together in a compact, roughly triangular formation. The orange cubes (carrots) are on the left, the green C-shaped pieces (celery) are in the center, and the pale white cubes (onions) are on the right. This arrangement follows a classic mirepoix configuration used in cooking, where these three ingredients are often combined. The spatial layout forms a cohesive triangle, with each pile occupying a distinct segment of the shape. This organization is both visually balanced and functionally logical in culinary practice.",

      "question": "Is the knife placed diagonally across the upper right area of the image, adjacent to the pile of onions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knife in Image B is positioned diagonally from the top center toward the lower right, extending over the upper edge of the onion pile. Its blade rests close to the onions, suggesting it was recently used for chopping. This placement is typical in food photography and culinary scenes, where the knife is shown near the chopped ingredients. The diagonal orientation adds dynamic composition to the image, and its proximity to the onions confirms adjacency. Even with the stylized rendering, the spatial relationship remains clear.",
