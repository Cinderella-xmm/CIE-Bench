      "question": "Is the trident with three prongs clearly visible and held vertically in the right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted holding a trident (trishula) in the right hand. The trident has three distinct prongs, which is consistent with traditional representations of Lord Shiva. It is oriented vertically, pointing upward, and appears to be made of a golden material that reflects light. This matches the iconographic standard for Shiva’s trident, symbolizing his power over creation, preservation, and destruction. The vertical orientation and clear visibility of the three prongs confirm its accurate depiction.",

      "question": "Is the damaru (small drum) held in the upper left hand with a cylindrical shape and horizontal orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper left hand of the deity holds a small drum, known as the damaru, which is a key attribute of Lord Shiva. The damaru is indeed cylindrical in shape and is held horizontally, consistent with traditional iconography where it represents the sound of creation. The positioning and form are accurately rendered, with the drum resting across the palm and fingers curled around it. This aligns with the symbolic representation of the damaru as an instrument of cosmic rhythm.",

      "question": "Is the golden serpent visibly coiled around the neck and shoulder, with its head raised near the right shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden serpent, a significant emblem of Shiva (often identified as Vasuki), is clearly visible in Image B. It is wrapped around the neck and drapes over the right shoulder, with its head raised prominently near the right shoulder area. The serpent's scales and coiled form are detailed and distinct, reinforcing its symbolic role as a representation of control over fear and poison. This placement and posture are typical in depictions of Shiva, emphasizing his mastery over death and danger.",

      "question": "Is there a clearly visible third eye centered on the forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third eye of Lord Shiva is not clearly visible. While the forehead is smooth and marked with a vertical line (tilaka), there is no distinct representation of a third eye—typically shown as a closed or open eye at the center of the forehead. In traditional iconography, the third eye symbolizes wisdom and spiritual insight, but in this particular depiction, it appears to be omitted or obscured. This absence contrasts with many classical representations where the third eye is a prominent feature.",

      "question": "Is the crescent moon positioned in the hair above the forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the deity's hair is styled in a jata (matted locks), which is characteristic of Shiva, but there is no visible crescent moon placed within the hair. The crescent moon is a common symbol associated with Shiva, representing time and cyclical nature, often seen in artistic depictions. However, in this image, the hair does not contain any lunar motif, making the absence notable. This differs from traditional iconography where the moon is usually present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, in Image B, a string of dark-colored beads, resembling rudraksha mala, is clearly draped around the neck of the deity. These beads are traditionally associated with Shiva and are used in meditation and prayer. The mala is visible and extends down the chest, consistent with religious symbolism. The texture and arrangement suggest authenticity in representation, aligning with both cultural and religious expectations.",

      "question": "Is the upper right hand raised with the index finger pointing upward and other fingers curled in abhaya mudra?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper right hand is raised, but it is not in the abhaya mudra. Instead, it is holding the trident vertically, which is a different gesture. The abhaya mudra involves the palm facing outward with the index finger pointing up and the rest curled, symbolizing protection and fearlessness. Here, the hand is occupied with the trident, so the mudra is not present. This contrasts with some traditional depictions where the abhaya mudra is used, but in this case, the hand is engaged with an object.",

      "question": "Are golden bangles visible on both wrists?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, golden bangles are visible on both wrists of the deity. On the right wrist, a thick golden bangle is present, and similarly, on the left wrist, another golden bangle can be seen. These accessories are consistent with traditional depictions of Shiva, who is often adorned with jewelry symbolizing divine power and auspiciousness. The presence of matching bangles on both wrists enhances the symmetry and aesthetic balance of the statue.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is seated in a cross-legged posture, commonly known as padmasana or lotus position, which is typical for meditative deities like Shiva. The legs are crossed, and the feet are tucked under the thighs, resting on the lap. This pose symbolizes stability, enlightenment, and inner peace. The base of the statue includes wave-like patterns, suggesting a foundation of water or cosmic energy, further enhancing the spiritual context of the posture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the deity show half-closed eyes, which is characteristic of meditative states in Hindu iconography. The lips are slightly parted, giving a calm and composed expression. The overall face conveys serenity and tranquility, consistent with Shiva’s role as the destroyer and transformer in the Trimurti. This peaceful demeanor aligns with the spiritual symbolism of deep contemplation and cosmic awareness.",
