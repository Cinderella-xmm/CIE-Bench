    "Question": "Q1: Is the dancer depicted with short dark hair?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is a stylized, cartoon-like figure appearing within a glowing oval mirror. The character has a round head with short, dark-colored hair that is neatly styled and covers the top of the head. This visual cue clearly indicates short dark hair. Based on common artistic representations of dancers in animated or stylized forms, such hairstyles are typical for male dancers, especially in simplified or exaggerated designs. The hair is consistent in color and length across the entire head, reinforcing the 'short dark hair' description.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the dancer wearing a black sleeveless leotard?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is shown wearing a form-fitting garment that covers the torso and extends to the upper thighs. The garment is uniformly black and lacks sleeves, which matches the definition of a sleeveless leotard. In dance contexts, especially ballet or contemporary dance, dancers commonly wear such attire for flexibility and aesthetic appeal. The design aligns with standard dancewear seen in both real-life and animated depictions. The material appears smooth and stretchy, consistent with leotard fabric.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the dancer’s right leg extended upward while the left leg supports the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's posture shows one leg raised high into the air and the other grounded. Observing the positioning: the right leg is lifted vertically, bent at the knee and pointing upward, while the left leg is straight and supporting the body's weight. This is a classic ballet pose known as an arabesque or attitude. The alignment of the limbs confirms that the right leg is extended upward and the left leg is bearing the load. This can be verified by noting the angle of the joints and the direction of the limbs relative to the ground.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the dancer’s head turned slightly to the left, facing forward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's head is oriented such that the face is directed toward the viewer, but the head is tilted slightly to the left (from the viewer’s perspective). The eyes are looking forward, and the chin is angled slightly downward, indicating a subtle turn to the left. However, the overall facial orientation remains forward rather than fully profiled. Given the stylized nature of the character, this slight tilt is consistent with dynamic poses in dance where balance and expression are emphasized. Therefore, the head is turned slightly to the left while still facing forward.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the dancer’s left hand extended forward toward the viewer with fingers splayed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer’s left arm is extended outward and slightly forward, with the hand open and fingers spread apart. This position is characteristic of expressive dance gestures, often used to convey grace or motion. The hand is positioned in front of the body and appears to be reaching toward the viewer, though not directly touching them. The splayed fingers suggest intentional articulation, common in dance choreography. The pose aligns with classical ballet arm positions, such as 'port de bras'. Thus, the left hand is indeed extended forward with fingers splayed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Does the dancer’s body form a diagonal line from the lower left to the upper right of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer’s body is positioned diagonally across the mirror. The supporting leg (left) is near the bottom-left portion of the mirror, while the raised leg (right) extends upward toward the upper-right area. The arms follow a similar diagonal trajectory: the left arm extends forward and slightly down, while the right arm reaches up. The overall silhouette traces a clear diagonal path from the lower left to the upper right of the mirror’s frame. This diagonal composition is a common artistic technique to create dynamism and movement in images. The visual flow of the body parts confirms this diagonal alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
