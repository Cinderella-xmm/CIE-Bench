    "Question": "Q1: Does the image include a framed mountain landscape painting with pine trees above the console table?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large rectangular framed artwork positioned directly above the console table. The painting depicts a mountainous landscape with tall pine trees in the foreground and misty peaks in the background. The color palette includes earthy tones such as browns, greens, and soft yellows, typical of natural landscape scenes. The frame appears to be made of wood, matching the aesthetic of the wooden console table below. Based on visual cues—such as the presence of mountains, pine trees, and atmospheric depth—the artwork clearly represents a mountain landscape. This conclusion aligns with common artistic representations of nature scenes, where pine trees are often used to convey forested highland environments.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the console table made of wood with four drawers in the middle and two cabinet doors on either side?",
    "explanation": "The console table in Image B is constructed from light-colored wood with visible grain patterns, consistent with natural hardwood finishes. In the center, there are three stacked drawers, each with a horizontal handle, rather than four. On either side of these drawers are two cabinet doors per side, making a total of four cabinet doors (two on the left, two on the right). Therefore, the central section contains only three drawers, not four. This observation is based on direct visual counting and spatial layout analysis. The design reflects mid-century modern furniture aesthetics, which commonly feature clean lines and functional storage compartments. However, the count of drawers is critical here: three, not four.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the objects on the console table arranged with a potted plant on the left, a stack of books in the center, and a vase with branches on the right?",
    "explanation": "Observing the top surface of the console table in Image B, we can identify three distinct items placed symmetrically. On the far left, there is a white cylindrical planter containing a green leafy plant, likely a type of houseplant such as a ZZ plant or similar foliage. In the center, there is a small stack of two books, one slightly larger than the other, placed neatly. On the far right, there is a rounded off-white ceramic vase holding bare, thin branches without leaves. This arrangement matches the described configuration: plant on the left, books in the center, vase with branches on the right. This kind of balanced, minimalist decor is common in modern interior design, emphasizing symmetry and natural elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the floor covered with herringbone-patterned parquet wood?",
    "explanation": "The flooring in Image B displays a distinctive pattern composed of rectangular wooden planks arranged in a zigzag or V-shaped formation, which is characteristic of the herringbone pattern. This style is commonly used in high-end interiors for its visual appeal and durability. The wood appears to be light-toned, possibly oak or a similar hardwood, and the joints between planks are precisely aligned, indicating professional installation. Herringbone parquet is a well-known architectural detail that adds texture and elegance to spaces. Given the clear geometric repetition and angle of the planks, this is definitively a herringbone pattern.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the wall behind the console table painted white?",
    "explanation": "The wall in Image B appears to be a light, neutral tone, but upon closer inspection, it has a subtle texture and a warm, slightly off-white or beige hue, rather than pure white. There is also a faint watermark-like text 'flyaway' written in cursive beneath the painting, which suggests a digital overlay or artistic effect, possibly indicating the image is stylized or edited. While the wall is very light, it lacks the crispness and brightness typically associated with true white paint. In interior design, such warm undertones are often used to create a cozy ambiance, especially when paired with natural wood elements. Therefore, while close to white, the wall is not purely white—it has a warmer tone.",
    "answer": "No"
