      "question": "Is the helmet equipped with two curved horns and a central white feather-like adornment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character inside the snow globe is wearing a helmet that features two prominent curved horns extending outward and upward from the sides. These horns are symmetrical and appear to be part of the helmet's design. However, there is no visible white feather-like adornment at the center of the helmet. Instead, the central area appears to have a metallic or decorative plate without any feather-like element. This conclusion is based on visual inspection of the helmet's details within the snow globe, which clearly shows the horns but lacks any feather-like structure.",

      "question": "Does the character hold a round shield with a central boss and rivets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is holding a small, round shield in their left hand. The shield has a visible central boss (a raised circular protrusion) and several small rivets around its edge, consistent with typical medieval-style shields. These features are clearly discernible despite the scale of the figure. The presence of both the boss and rivets indicates a detailed and historically inspired design, which aligns with common depictions of Viking or Norse-inspired armor. Therefore, based on the visual evidence, the shield matches the description.",

      "question": "Is there a sword sheathed at the characterâ€™s back with a visible hilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a stylized, chibi-like form within a snow globe. Despite the small scale, a sword can be seen sheathed at the character's back. The hilt of the sword is visible, protruding slightly above the scabbard, and it appears to have a distinct guard and grip. This detail is consistent with the character's warrior appearance and the typical equipment of a Nordic warrior as seen in fantasy settings like Skyrim. The visibility of the hilt, even at this scale, confirms the presence of a sheathed sword.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's shoulder armor (pauldron) is visible and appears to have a decorative pattern. Upon close inspection, the design includes swirling motifs that resemble Norse or Viking-inspired engravings, such as interlacing lines and knotwork patterns commonly associated with Norse art. Although the style is simplified due to the chibi aesthetic, the overall shape and detailing suggest an intentional nod to Norse design elements. This conclusion is supported by world knowledge of Norse artistic motifs and their frequent use in fantasy depictions of Nordic warriors.",

      "question": "Does the tunic have fur trim along its edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is wearing a dark tunic that extends down to the knees. Along the edges of the tunic, particularly at the hem and sleeves, there is a visible layer of white fur trim. This detail is consistent with the cold, mountainous environment suggested by the snowy landscape in the background and is typical of Nordic or Viking attire in fantasy settings. The fur trim adds to the character's rugged, winter-ready appearance, reinforcing the thematic elements of the scene. Thus, based on visual cues and cultural context, the tunic does have fur trim.",

      "question": "Does the armor exhibit a metallic texture or finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's armor, including the chest plate, pauldrons, and gauntlets, has a reflective, dark metallic appearance. The surface shows subtle highlights and shadows that suggest a polished metal finish, likely iron or steel, consistent with medieval or fantasy warrior armor. The sheen and texture indicate a metallic material rather than leather or fabric. This is further supported by the way light interacts with the armor's surface, creating reflections that mimic real metal. Therefore, the armor clearly exhibits a metallic texture or finish.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet worn by the character has two horns that curve outward and then upward, forming a classic Viking-style silhouette. These horns are positioned symmetrically on either side of the helmet, mirroring each other in shape and placement. This design is iconic in Norse-inspired imagery and is often used to evoke a sense of strength and tradition. The symmetry and curvature are clearly visible, even in the stylized chibi form, confirming that the horns match the described configuration.",
