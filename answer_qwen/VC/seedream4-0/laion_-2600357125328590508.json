      "question": "Is the vertical white \"Under Armour\" logo clearly visible on the outer side of the calf, maintaining its original font, spacing, and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a large-scale LEGO sculpture modeled after a sock. The vertical white 'Under Armour' logo is present on the outer side of the calf area, constructed using white LEGO bricks arranged in a pattern that mimics the original logo's shape. While the overall form and orientation are preserved, the pixelated nature of LEGO blocks introduces a blocky texture that alters the fine details of the font and spacing compared to the smooth, continuous lines of the original. However, the general structure—vertical alignment, letter order, and approximate proportions—remains consistent with the original design. Given that this is a stylized recreation using discrete building blocks, some loss of precision in font and spacing is expected, but the core identity of the logo is still recognizable.",

      "question": "Is there an orange tag with a black Under Armour logo located at the top edge of the sock cuff?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top edge of the sock cuff features a small orange LEGO piece placed centrally, which corresponds to the position of the original orange tag. This orange element has a black Under Armour logo printed or embedded on it, matching the original design. Although the material and construction method differ (LEGO brick vs. fabric tag), the placement, color, and branding are accurately represented. The use of LEGO pieces to simulate a fabric tag is a creative adaptation, but it maintains the essential visual and symbolic elements of the original.",

      "question": "Is the stylized \"UA\" logo present on the ankle section of the sock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ankle section of the LEGO sock includes a prominent stylized 'UA' logo formed by black LEGO bricks against a lighter background. This matches the original sock's design where the 'UA' logo appears on the ankle. The shape and positioning are consistent with the original, though again rendered in a pixelated, blocky style due to the LEGO medium. Despite the medium difference, the logo is clearly identifiable and placed in the correct anatomical region of the sock.",

      "question": "Are the gray and white geometric patterns on the foot and shin area preserved in their original positions and color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foot and shin areas of the LEGO sock feature geometric patterns composed of gray and white LEGO bricks. These patterns mirror the original sock’s design in terms of placement and color scheme—gray sections for reinforcement and white accents for contrast. The arrangement of these blocks follows the same layout as the original, including angular shapes and stripes. While the resolution is lower due to the blocky nature of LEGO, the overall design intent and color distribution are preserved. The transitions between colors and the spatial relationships remain faithful to the original.",

      "question": "Are the gray reinforced sections on the heel and toe maintained in their original shape and location?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heel and toe areas of the LEGO sock are constructed with gray LEGO bricks, forming reinforced zones that match the original sock’s design. The heel section is distinctly thicker and shaped to provide support, while the toe area is also reinforced with gray bricks, maintaining the original shape and location. Although the edges are more angular due to the LEGO format, the functional and aesthetic purpose of these reinforced areas is preserved. The placement and relative size are consistent with the original, indicating that the structural integrity and design intent have been maintained.",

      "question": "Is the small text printed vertically along the lower leg of the sock still visible and in its original position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower leg area of the LEGO sock includes a series of small, vertically aligned white LEGO bricks that mimic the appearance of text. While the original sock has fine-print text describing product features, the LEGO version uses a simplified representation. Due to the limited resolution of LEGO bricks, the actual content of the text cannot be read, but its presence, vertical orientation, and position along the lower leg are preserved. The intent to include informational text in that location is respected, even if the detail is lost in translation to the LEGO medium.",
