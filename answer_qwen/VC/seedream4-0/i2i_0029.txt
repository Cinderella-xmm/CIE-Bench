    "Question": "Q1: Does the image retain the stark black-and-white contrast characteristic of the zebra's stripes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's body is clearly visible with distinct black and white stripes that are sharp and well-defined. The contrast between the dark and light stripes is pronounced, consistent with the natural appearance of a zebra's coat. This high contrast is maintained across the entire visible portion of the zebra, including its neck, torso, legs, and head. Based on visual inspection and world knowledge about zebra anatomy and pigmentation, zebras are known for their bold black-and-white striping, which serves purposes such as camouflage and insect deterrence. The edited image preserves this key feature accurately.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the zebra's mane still upright and striped?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the zebra's mane appears to be upright and running along the back of its neck. The mane is composed of individual hairs that follow the same black-and-white striped pattern as the rest of the body, indicating it is striped. This matches biological reality, where a zebra's mane is typically striped in alignment with the body's pattern. The mane is not flattened or disheveled, and it maintains an erect posture, consistent with the natural behavior of zebras when alert or moving. Thus, both the orientation and patterning of the mane are preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the zebra's ears still pointed and visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's ears are clearly visible and positioned on the top of its head. They are pointed upward and outward, which is typical for zebras when they are attentive or grazing. The shape and structure of the ears match the expected anatomy of a zebra—triangular and erect. The inner part of the ear shows a lighter coloration, which is also consistent with real zebra anatomy. There is no indication of deformation or obscuration, so the ears remain fully visible and anatomically accurate.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the zebra depicted in a grazing posture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's head is lowered toward the ground, with its muzzle close to the grass. Its neck is bent forward, and its front legs are slightly bent, indicating a natural grazing stance. This posture is consistent with how zebras feed on grass in the wild. The positioning of the limbs and head aligns with known animal behavior: zebras lower their heads to reach vegetation while maintaining balance. Therefore, the zebra is clearly shown in a grazing posture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the background still primarily composed of green grass?",
    "explanation": "Although Image B features a surreal element—a large, artificial-looking black-and-white striped surface beneath the zebra—the upper portion of the background still shows green grass, particularly in the distance and around the edges. However, the foreground has been replaced by a patterned surface resembling a giant zebra stripe carpet. While some green grass remains visible, especially near the zebra's feet and in patches, the dominant background is now this artificial striped pattern rather than natural grassland. Therefore, the background is no longer primarily composed of green grass but includes a significant non-natural element. Based on the definition of 'primarily,' which implies majority composition, the answer must reflect that the grass is no longer the main component.",
    "answer": "No"
