      "question": "Is the background composed of green grass with visible blades and natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a field of green grass. Upon close inspection, individual blades of grass are discernible, particularly in the foreground and midground areas. The texture appears natural, with slight variations in color and blade orientation, consistent with real grass under outdoor lighting conditions. There is no indication of artificial or digitally smoothed textures; instead, the grass exhibits subtle shading and depth that suggest a realistic surface. This aligns with common knowledge about how grass typically appears in natural settings when photographed at close range.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there soft shadows cast by the subject(s) onto the grass, consistent with natural outdoor lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the banana and the yellow dog-like figure cast subtle shadows on the grass beneath them. These shadows are soft-edged and gently diffuse, indicating ambient, diffused lighting typical of an overcast day or shaded outdoor environment. The direction of the shadows suggests a light source from above and slightly to one side, which is consistent with natural daylight. The absence of harsh contrasts or sharp edges further supports the idea of soft, natural lighting. Based on world knowledge, such shadow characteristics are common in outdoor scenes with indirect sunlight.",

      "question": "Is the fused form positioned directly on the grass surface, with contact points visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'fused form' in Image B refers to the yellow dog-like figure standing next to the banana. Both objects are placed directly on the grass, and their bases make clear contact with the ground. The feet of the dog figure and the tip of the banana rest on the grass, with visible interaction between the surfaces—such as slight compression of grass blades under weight. These contact points are clearly visible and consistent with physical placement on a natural surface. There is no floating or suspended appearance, confirming direct contact with the ground.",

      "question": "Is the grass predominantly green with natural variations in shade and tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grass in Image B displays a rich green hue overall, but it also features subtle variations in tone—darker greens in shadowed areas and lighter tones where light hits more directly. These tonal shifts contribute to a sense of depth and realism. Additionally, some blades appear slightly yellowed or brown-tipped, which is typical in natural grass due to environmental factors like sun exposure or dryness. Such variation is consistent with real-world grass and indicates a non-uniform, naturally occurring surface.",

      "question": "Does the fused form incorporate both yellow and tan hues, reflecting the original banana and dog colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'fused form' in Image B refers to the yellow dog-like figure, which is entirely yellow in color, matching the banana beside it. While the original dog (from Image A) was tan, this edited version has been transformed into a solid yellow color, likely to visually merge with the banana. However, the question asks whether the fused form incorporates *both* yellow and tan hues. In this case, the figure is uniformly yellow, with no visible tan elements. Therefore, although the banana contributes yellow, the dog component does not retain its original tan color. Thus, the fused form does not reflect both original colors simultaneously.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are individual blades of grass visible in the foreground and midground, contributing to a textured surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, in Image B, individual blades of grass are clearly visible in both the foreground and midground. They vary in length, direction, and brightness, creating a detailed and textured surface. Some blades are upright, others bent, and their tips show fine detail, which enhances the realism of the scene. This level of detail is consistent with high-resolution photography of natural grass and contributes significantly to the perception of depth and texture. World knowledge confirms that such visibility is expected in well-lit, close-up shots of grass.",
