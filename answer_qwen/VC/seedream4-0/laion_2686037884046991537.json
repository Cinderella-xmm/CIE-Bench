      "question": "Does each whoopie pie character retain a dark brown chocolate-colored outer layer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the whoopie pie characters are stylized cartoon versions of real whoopie pies. Each character has a dark brown outer layer that resembles chocolate cake, consistent with the appearance of traditional whoopie pies. This coloration is maintained across all depicted characters, including those in the top panel and the one running in the bottom panel. The visual design clearly emphasizes the chocolate-like exterior, which aligns with common knowledge about whoopie pies being made from chocolate cake layers. There is no deviation in color or material representation that would suggest otherwise.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a visible white cream filling between the two chocolate halves of each whoopie pie character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, every whoopie pie character displays a distinct white layer sandwiched between the two dark brown halves. This white layer represents the cream filling, which is a defining feature of whoopie pies. In both panels, the filling is clearly visible and consistently colored white, matching the typical appearance of marshmallow or vanilla cream used in such desserts. Even in the animated form, the artistic representation preserves this key structural element.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does each whoopie pie character maintain a two-layered structure with an inner filling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The whoopie pie characters in Image B are designed with two distinct dark brown cake-like layers enclosing a central white filling. This two-layered structure is consistent across all characters, whether they are stationary on the plate or animated as a running figure. The presence of a middle filling between the two outer layers confirms the standard whoopie pie construction. Even in cartoon form, the essential architectural design of the dessert is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a white plate present beneath the whoopie pie characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the top panel of Image B, two whoopie pie characters are placed on a circular white plate. The plate is clearly visible under them, with its edge extending beyond the characters. The plate's surface is smooth and white, matching typical dinnerware used for serving desserts. This detail is consistent with how food items are commonly presented in illustrations, especially in a kitchen setting like the one shown.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are at least two whoopie pie characters positioned on the edge of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the top panel of Image B, two whoopie pie characters are placed on the plate. Both are positioned near the edge, with their lower portions extending toward the rim. Their placement suggests they are close to falling off, which adds a playful dynamic to the scene. Since both characters are on the edge, the condition 'at least two' is satisfied. This positioning is intentional in the cartoon style to create movement and humor.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all whoopie pie characters circular in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All whoopie pie characters in Image B are depicted as circular in shape, both in the top panel (where two are on the plate) and in the bottom panel (where one is running). Despite the addition of limbs and facial features, the base shape remains round, consistent with the actual form of whoopie pies. Cartoon stylization does not alter the fundamental circular geometry, preserving realism within the whimsical context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a clear contrast between the dark brown outer layers and the white inner filling of each whoopie pie character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark brown outer layers of the whoopie pie characters are sharply contrasted with the bright white inner filling. This high-contrast color scheme is consistent across all characters and enhances visual clarity, making the layered structure easily distinguishable. The use of contrasting colors is a common technique in cartoon art to emphasize features and improve readability, especially when depicting food items.",

      "question": "Do the chocolate tops of the whoopie pie characters show signs of surface cracking or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chocolate tops of the whoopie pie characters exhibit subtle surface details such as small cracks and uneven textures, particularly noticeable in the top panel. These features mimic the natural appearance of baked chocolate cakes, where slight fissures often occur during cooling. While simplified for cartoon purposes, these textural elements are present and contribute to a more realistic depiction of the dessertâ€™s surface.",
