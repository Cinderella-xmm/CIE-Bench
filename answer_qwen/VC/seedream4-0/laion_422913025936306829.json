      "question": "Is the central figure depicted in a bent-forward pose with one arm raised and the other supporting the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is clearly shown in a dynamic, bent-forward pose. The left arm is raised upward, extending toward the upper part of the composition, while the right arm is positioned lower, appearing to support or balance the body. This posture suggests movement and strength, consistent with a figure in action. The angle of the torso and limbs confirms that the figure is leaning forward, not standing upright. Based on visual cues such as limb positioning and body orientation, this pose matches the description provided. No additional context from Image A is needed here, as the pose is directly observable.",

      "question": "Is there a circular emblem with wavy internal lines located on the chest of the central figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure has a prominent circular emblem on the chest. The emblem contains three horizontal wavy lines inside it, which are clearly visible and stylized. This design is consistent with the Wonder Woman logo, which features a similar motif. The placement on the chest and the distinct wavy pattern confirm that this is indeed a circular emblem with wavy internal lines. In Image A, the same emblem is present but rendered in a monochromatic gold line-art style, whereas in Image B, it is more vividly colored with orange and red tones. However, the core design remains identical, confirming the presence of the emblem in both images. The comparison reinforces that the emblem is consistently located on the chest and retains its symbolic elements across both versions.",

      "question": "Is the central figure enclosed within a diamond-shaped geometric frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is surrounded by an intricate geometric pattern. Upon close inspection, the figure is framed by a large diamond-shaped structure composed of angular lines and symmetrical patterns. This diamond shape is formed by intersecting diagonal lines and decorative borders that enclose the figure, creating a sense of focus and symmetry. The frame is not merely decorative but structurally defines the space around the figure. In Image A, the same diamond-shaped frame is present, though it is rendered in a simpler, golden outline against a dark background. The consistency between the two images confirms that the diamond frame is a key compositional element. Therefore, the answer is based on direct observation of the geometric structure in Image B and validated by comparison with Image A.",

      "question": "Is there a floral motif located in the top-left corner of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-left corner of the mural features a stylized floral motif. It consists of a flower with multiple petals and a central core, outlined in bright colors like pink and orange, with green accents. This motif is part of the larger decorative pattern surrounding the central figure. The floral design is symmetrical and integrated into the overall composition. In Image A, the same floral motif appears in the same location, though it is rendered in a monochromatic gold line-art style. The position and shape are consistent across both images, confirming that the floral element is intentionally placed in the top-left corner. Thus, the presence of the floral motif in Image B is confirmed through direct observation and cross-verification with Image A.",

      "question": "Are there star symbols located near the upper shoulders of the central figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area near the upper shoulders of the central figure includes small star-like symbols. These stars are stylized and appear as five-pointed shapes, embedded within the geometric patterns surrounding the figure. They are positioned symmetrically on both sides, just above the shoulder area. The stars are part of the decorative framework and contribute to the cosmic or celestial theme of the artwork. In Image A, similar star symbols are present in the same locations, though they are less vibrant due to the monochrome design. The consistency in placement and form between the two images supports the conclusion that the stars are indeed located near the upper shoulders. Therefore, based on visual evidence in Image B and confirmation via Image A, the answer is affirmative.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure has long, wavy hair that cascades over the shoulders and down the back. The hair is rendered with flowing, curved lines and is highlighted with bright orange and yellow tones, giving it a dynamic and energetic appearance. The waves are pronounced and extend beyond the head, emphasizing movement and volume. This hairstyle is characteristic of Wonder Womanâ€™s iconic look. In Image A, the same wavy hair is present, though depicted in a simpler line-art style using gold outlines. The overall shape and flow remain consistent, confirming that the hair is long and wavy in both versions. Therefore, the visual evidence in Image B, supported by the comparison with Image A, confirms the presence of long, wavy hair flowing over the shoulders.",
