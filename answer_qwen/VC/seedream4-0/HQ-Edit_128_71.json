      "question": "Is the torch held high in the statue’s right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Statue of Liberty is depicted inside a lantern, and its right arm is clearly raised upward, holding a torch. This aligns with the well-known pose of the actual Statue of Liberty, where the right hand holds the torch aloft as a symbol of enlightenment. The visual cues—such as the position of the arm and the flame atop the torch—confirm this. Based on world knowledge, the Statue of Liberty's torch is indeed held in the right hand, which matches the depiction here.",

      "question": "Does the statue hold a tablet in its left hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue's left hand is positioned downward and is holding a rectangular object that resembles a tablet. This is consistent with the actual design of the Statue of Liberty, where the left hand holds a tablet inscribed with the date of American independence (July 4, 1776). The shape and placement of the object in the image match this known feature. Therefore, based on both visual evidence and world knowledge, the statue does hold a tablet in its left hand.",

      "question": "Does the statue wear a crown with exactly seven sharp points radiating from the top of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue's head is adorned with a crown that features multiple sharp points extending outward. Observing the crown closely, there are seven distinct rays or spikes, which corresponds to the actual design of the Statue of Liberty's crown. These seven points represent the seven continents and seven seas, a fact supported by historical and architectural knowledge. The depiction in the image accurately reflects this symbolic detail.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the statue wear a long, flowing robe with clearly defined vertical and horizontal folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is shown wearing a draped garment that extends from the shoulders down to the base. The robe has visible folds, both vertical and horizontal, which give it a sense of movement and texture. This is consistent with the real Statue of Liberty’s design, where the robes are sculpted to appear flowing and layered. The folds are rendered with enough detail in the miniature model to be clearly discernible, matching the artistic style of the original sculpture.",

      "question": "Is the statue predominantly colored in a greenish-blue (verdigris) hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue in Image B exhibits a greenish-blue patina, which is characteristic of copper that has oxidized over time. This verdigris coloration is a well-known feature of the actual Statue of Liberty, which was originally brown but developed its iconic green color due to weathering. The model inside the lantern accurately captures this color transformation, making it visually consistent with the real-world appearance of the statue.",

      "question": "Is the statue standing upright with one arm raised and the other lowered holding an object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is clearly standing upright on its pedestal. One arm (the right) is raised high, holding the torch, while the other (the left) is lowered and holding the tablet. This posture is iconic and matches the actual stance of the Statue of Liberty. The alignment of the body, arms, and objects is consistent with both the visual representation and the known design of the monument.",
