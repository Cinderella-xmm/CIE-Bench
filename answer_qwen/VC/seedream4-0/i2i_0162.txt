    "Question": "Q1: Does the mouse retain its brown, orange, and white fur pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse displays a distinct fur pattern that includes shades of brown on its back, orange on its sides and head, and white on its belly and around the mouth. This coloration is consistent with common domestic or wild mouse species, particularly those found in household environments. The fur appears smooth and well-defined, with clear transitions between colors, which supports the presence of a naturalistic color pattern. Based on visual cues such as fur texture, color distribution, and anatomical proportions, the mouse retains the described fur pattern. There is no indication of unnatural coloring or distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the mouse's whiskers and large ears clearly visible?",
    "explanation": "The mouse in Image B has long, thin whiskers extending from its snout, which are clearly visible and detailed. These whiskers are typical sensory organs in rodents, used for navigation and tactile perception. Additionally, the ears are large, rounded, and prominently displayed, with pink inner surfaces and defined outer edges. These features align with biological accuracy for mice and are rendered with high clarity in the image. The visibility of both whiskers and ears is enhanced by the lighting and focus, making them easily distinguishable.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the food crumbs present on the floor near the mouse?",
    "explanation": "Scattered across the tiled floor in front of and around the mouse are numerous small, yellowish crumbs. These crumbs appear to be remnants of bread or similar food items, commonly found in kitchen settings where mice might forage. Their placement directly in the mouse’s vicinity suggests they are the source of interest for the animal. The crumbs are well-defined and evenly distributed, indicating intentional placement within the scene. This detail is consistent with realistic depictions of rodent behavior in human habitats.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the mouse positioned near the crumbs and looking downward towards them?",
    "explanation": "The mouse is situated directly among the crumbs, with its body oriented toward them. Its head is slightly lowered, and its gaze is directed downward, focusing on the food particles. This posture is typical of foraging behavior in mice, who tend to sniff and inspect food before consuming it. The angle of the head and the positioning of the eyes confirm that the mouse is attending to the crumbs. This behavior aligns with known rodent instincts and is accurately represented in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the general kitchen setting with flooring and cabinets identifiable?",
    "explanation": "The background of Image B shows wooden cabinets and a stainless steel appliance (likely a refrigerator), which are common elements in a kitchen environment. The flooring consists of large, light-brown tiles with visible grout lines, typical of residential kitchens. Although the background is slightly blurred due to depth of field, the shapes and materials are recognizable as standard kitchen fixtures. This setting provides context for the mouse’s presence, reinforcing the idea of a domestic indoor space where food scraps might accumulate. The combination of these visual cues confirms the identification of a kitchen environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
