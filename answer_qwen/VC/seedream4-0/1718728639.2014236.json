      "question": "Does the edited image retain the original facial features including the eye shape, nose contour, lip fullness, and symmetrical jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the figure are rendered in a mosaic style, which uses small tiles to form the overall image. Despite this artistic transformation, the underlying structure of the face remains consistent with the original. The eyes retain their almond shape, the nose maintains its defined contour, the lips appear full and symmetrically shaped, and the jawline is still clearly defined and balanced. Although the mosaic technique introduces a fragmented texture, the proportions and symmetry of the facial features are preserved. This suggests that the artist aimed to maintain the original facial characteristics while applying a new stylistic treatment. Comparing with Image A, where the face is smooth and photorealistic, Image B’s version retains the same key facial landmarks, indicating faithful preservation of the original features despite the stylistic change.",

      "question": "Is the white hair still present, flowing down past the shoulders, and positioned naturally around the head and neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is depicted using mosaic tiles, but it is still clearly identifiable as white and flows down past the shoulders. The strands are arranged in a way that mimics natural movement and volume, with some parts falling over the shoulders and framing the neck. The positioning around the head and neck appears consistent with the original image, maintaining a soft, flowing quality. While the texture has changed due to the mosaic effect, the overall shape, color, and placement of the hair remain faithful to the original. In comparison to Image A, where the hair is rendered with smooth, realistic strands, Image B's mosaic rendition preserves the same general flow and length, albeit with a more stylized appearance. Therefore, the hair’s presence and positioning are retained.",

      "question": "Is the crown still present with its original angular, symmetrical design and central gemstone at the apex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crown in Image B is clearly visible and composed of mosaic tiles, but its overall structure matches the original design. It retains the angular, symmetrical shape with pointed elements extending outward from the center. The central gemstone at the apex is also present, though represented by a cluster of darker tiles forming a distinct point. The symmetry of the crown is preserved, with matching patterns on both sides. When compared to Image A, where the crown is metallic and highly detailed, Image B’s version abstracts the details into a mosaic pattern but does not alter the fundamental design. The core elements—angularity, symmetry, and central gem—are all maintained, even if expressed through a different medium.",

      "question": "Are the wings still symmetrically extended from the shoulders with the same broad, upward-curving shape and full span?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are depicted using a mosaic technique, yet they maintain their broad, upward-curving shape and full span. They extend symmetrically from the shoulders, mirroring each other in size, curvature, and tile arrangement. The feathers are formed by individual tiles, but their layered structure and sweeping arc are consistent with the original wing design. Compared to Image A, where the wings are rendered in a realistic, metallic texture with fine feather detail, Image B transforms them into a stylized mosaic format. However, the overall silhouette, symmetry, and extension remain unchanged. The artistic interpretation preserves the wings’ grandeur and structural integrity, confirming that their form is faithfully retained.",

      "question": "Is the figure still standing upright with arms at the sides and facing directly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figure in an upright posture, with arms positioned at the sides and the body oriented directly toward the viewer. The mosaic rendering does not distort the stance; the alignment of the torso, shoulders, and limbs indicates a frontal pose. The symmetry of the composition supports this conclusion, as both wings and shoulders are evenly placed. When compared to Image A, where the figure stands in a similar pose, Image B maintains the same orientation and posture. The mosaic style adds texture but does not alter the spatial relationship between body parts or the direction of the gaze. Thus, the figure’s stance is preserved.",

      "question": "Is the original skin tone preserved, and does the facial expression remain neutral with a slight hint of serenity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skin tone in Image B is represented through mosaic tiles in shades of beige and light brown, which approximate the original skin tone seen in Image A. While the texture is now fragmented, the overall color palette remains consistent with the original. The facial expression is also preserved: the eyes are calm, the mouth is closed in a relaxed manner, and the eyebrows are gently arched, conveying a neutral yet serene demeanor. The mosaic style does not introduce any emotional distortion; instead, it enhances the sense of timelessness and reverence, aligning with the serenity of the original. The subtle contours of the face suggest a peaceful expression, consistent with the original image. Therefore, both skin tone and expression are effectively maintained.",

      "question": "Are the body proportions, including the torso width, arm length, and breast shape, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body proportions are visually consistent with those in Image A. The torso width, relative to the shoulders and hips, remains proportionate. The arms extend downward in a natural length, and the breast shape is accurately represented through the mosaic tiling, preserving the curvature and placement. The mosaic technique breaks down the form into smaller units, but the overall silhouette and anatomical relationships are maintained. When comparing to Image A, where the body is rendered in a realistic 3D style, Image B’s version abstracts the details but does not distort the proportions. The use of geometric patterns in the mosaic follows the underlying body structure, ensuring that key dimensions like torso width, arm length, and breast shape are consistent with the original. Thus, the body proportions are preserved.",
