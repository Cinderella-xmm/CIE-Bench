      "question": "Does the teddy bear still wear a white helmet and a blue cape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear is clearly wearing a helmet that is white in color, though its surface is geometrically faceted rather than smooth, indicating a stylized or low-poly art style. The helmet retains its overall shape and position on the bear's head, consistent with a typical motorcycle helmet. Additionally, the bear has a blue cloth draped over its shoulders, flowing behind it like a cape. Although the cape appears angular due to the low-poly rendering, its color and placement are consistent with the original blue cape seen in Image A. Thus, despite the artistic transformation, both the helmet and cape are present and identifiable.",

      "question": "Is the teddy bear still golden-brown with black button eyes and a brown nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear maintains a golden-brown coloration, although the surface is composed of polygonal facets, giving it a low-poly appearance. Despite this stylization, the color remains consistent with the original golden-brown hue. The eyes are represented as dark, angular shapes, resembling black buttons in form and function, even if they lack the smoothness of real buttons. The nose is also depicted as a small, dark triangular feature, matching the brown tone of the original bear’s nose. While the facial features are simplified due to the geometric design, their color and placement align with the original characteristics.",

      "question": "Does the motorcycle retain its overall shape with a round headlight, two wheels, and handlebars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motorcycle in Image B preserves the fundamental structure of a classic cruiser-style bike. It features two wheels, one at the front and one at the back, both with visible tires and rims. The handlebars are present and positioned correctly for riding. The headlight is round and mounted at the front, consistent with the original design. However, all components are rendered in a low-poly style, meaning they are made of flat, angular surfaces instead of smooth curves. Despite this stylistic change, the key elements—round headlight, two wheels, and handlebars—are still identifiable and maintain their functional positions. Therefore, the overall shape and essential features are retained.",

      "question": "Is the teddy bear still seated on the motorcycle in a similar posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear is seated on the motorcycle in a posture that closely mirrors the original. Its legs are positioned on either side of the bike, with one foot near the ground and the other resting on the footpeg. The arms are placed on the handlebars, suggesting active control of the motorcycle. Although the bear’s body is now composed of angular polygons, the relative positioning of limbs and torso remains consistent with the original image. The rider’s orientation and balance appear unchanged, indicating that the posture has been preserved despite the artistic transformation.",

      "question": "Is Sugarloaf Mountain still visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes a large, distinctive mountain formation that resembles Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio de Janeiro. Although the mountain is rendered in a low-poly, geometric style, its iconic silhouette—a prominent peak rising from a base of greenery—is recognizable. The surrounding landscape, including water and distant buildings, further supports the identification of the location. While the visual style differs from the realistic depiction in Image A, the mountain’s shape and position in the background remain consistent with the original scene. Therefore, Sugarloaf Mountain is still present and identifiable, albeit stylized.",
