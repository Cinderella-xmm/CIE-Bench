    "Question": "Q1: Is the number \"1423\" clearly visible on the front of the train?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the train displays a number near the bottom center. The digits '1423' are present and rendered in a bold, white font against a dark background, making them highly legible despite the stylized, pop-art aesthetic of the image. The number is positioned below the central circular light and above the headlights, consistent with typical train identification placement. Although the artistic style uses exaggerated colors and outlines, the number remains distinguishable due to high contrast and clear digit shapes. This visibility aligns with real-world practices where train numbers are prominently displayed for identification.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the train have two circular headlights below a central white circular light on its front?",
    "explanation": "Observing the front of the train in Image B, there is a central white circular light located just below the windshield. Directly beneath this central light, two smaller circular lights are symmetrically placed — one on each side. These match the description of headlights commonly found on modern trains. The artistic rendering enhances their visibility with bold outlines and contrasting colors, but the spatial arrangement (central light above two lower circular lights) matches standard design patterns. Even with the stylized appearance, the layout is consistent with typical train lighting configurations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are there multiple vertical rows of white-framed windows on the side of the barn?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the side of the barn facing the viewer shows several vertical columns of windows. Each window has a white frame, and they are arranged in neat, repeating rows along the length of the building. There are at least four distinct vertical rows visible, indicating a structured architectural design typical of older industrial or agricultural buildings. The pop-art style exaggerates the contrast between the red walls and white frames, but the pattern of multiple vertical rows remains clearly identifiable. This configuration is consistent with traditional barn designs that require ventilation and natural light across multiple levels.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there two large wooden doors centered on the lower part of the barn’s front facade?",
    "explanation": "The front facade of the barn in Image B features a prominent set of double doors located at the base of the structure. These doors are large, made of wood, and aligned centrally beneath the roofline. They are depicted with vertical planks and a small horizontal crossbar, typical of barn door construction. Despite the stylized art style, the symmetry and size of these doors indicate they are meant to be primary access points. The visual cues — such as shadowing, texture, and proportion — confirm their presence and function as large, centered doors.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the railway tracks extend forward from under the train and curve gently to the right into the distance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the railway tracks begin directly beneath the train and continue forward into the scene. As they progress away from the train, they visibly bend to the right, forming a gentle curve that leads into the background. This curvature is emphasized by the perspective lines of the rails and the gravel bed, which guide the viewer's eye toward the horizon. The artistic style uses strong outlines and color contrasts to accentuate this path, but the directional flow of the tracks remains consistent with real-world track layouts designed to navigate terrain. The curve is subtle but clearly defined.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the yellow triangular warning sign with a blue border and the \"50\" speed limit sign visible near the track on the left side?",
    "explanation": "On the left side of the image, near the track, there is a road sign visible. It consists of a yellow triangle with a blue border, which is a common design for warning signs in many countries. Below it, a circular sign with the number '50' is clearly displayed, indicating a speed limit. While the image is stylized, the shapes and colors are preserved enough to identify these elements. The yellow triangle contains a black symbol (though not fully detailed), and the '50' is centered within a blue circle — both consistent with standard traffic signage. The placement near the tracks suggests it is a railway-related warning or speed restriction sign.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the train positioned directly on the railway tracks?",
    "explanation": "The train in Image B is clearly situated on the railway tracks. Its wheels are aligned with the rails, and the undercarriage appears to rest directly on the track bed. The perspective shows the train moving forward along the rails, with no indication of being off-track or elevated. The artistic rendering emphasizes this alignment through strong linear guides and consistent spacing between the rails and the train's chassis. Even though the image uses exaggerated colors and outlines, the spatial relationship between the train and the tracks remains accurate to real-world physics and engineering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
