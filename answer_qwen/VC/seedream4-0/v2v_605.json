      "question": "Is the gorilla depicted with predominantly dark gray to black fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure shown is not a realistic depiction of a gorilla but rather a stylized Funko Pop! vinyl figurine labeled 'Jungle King'. The character has dark fur, primarily in shades of dark gray and black, consistent with the typical coloration of a gorilla. However, it's important to note that this is a cartoonish representation, not a photorealistic one. Despite the stylization, the fur color remains within the expected range for a gorilla, which is generally dark gray to black. Therefore, based on visual cues and world knowledge about gorilla fur coloration, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Does the gorilla have dark, almost black skin on its face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine’s face is stylized with large, round eyes and a simplified facial structure typical of Funko Pop! designs. While the face is not rendered with realistic skin tones, it does feature a dark complexion—closer to dark brown or black—which aligns with the natural facial skin color of real gorillas. Gorillas are known to have dark facial skin, especially around the muzzle and eyes, which contrasts with their fur. Although the representation is exaggerated and cartoonish, the intended design reflects this characteristic. Thus, based on both visual cues and biological knowledge of gorillas, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Is the gorilla shown with a broad, muscular chest and visible pectoral definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B is designed in a chibi-style format, which emphasizes cute, exaggerated proportions rather than anatomical accuracy. As such, while the figure has a rounded torso, it lacks detailed musculature or visible pectoral definition. In contrast, real gorillas, especially silverbacks, are known for their broad, muscular chests and prominent pectorals. However, due to the stylized nature of the Funko Pop! design, these features are minimized or absent. Therefore, despite the general shape suggesting strength, there is no clear depiction of defined pectoral muscles. Based on visual analysis and understanding of both artistic style and animal anatomy, the answer is no.",

      "question": "Is there a lighter-colored area on the gorilla’s back and shoulders, indicative of a silverback?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A silverback gorilla is distinguished by a patch of silver-gray hair on its back and shoulders, which develops as the male ages. In Image B, the figurine does not display any such silver-colored patch. Instead, the fur across the entire body—including the back and shoulders—is uniformly dark gray to black. This absence of a silver patch indicates that the character is not meant to represent a mature silverback gorilla. Even though the figure is labeled 'Jungle King', which might suggest dominance, the lack of silver fur contradicts the defining trait of a silverback. Hence, based on both visual evidence and zoological knowledge, the answer is no.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine’s facial features are highly stylized. It has a small, rounded nose and minimal brow ridge detail, which is typical of Funko Pop! figures that prioritize cuteness over realism. Real gorillas possess broad, flat noses and pronounced brow ridges as part of their facial structure. These traits are absent in the cartoon representation. The design simplifies the face significantly, reducing anatomical accuracy. Therefore, despite being inspired by a gorilla, the figurine does not exhibit the key facial characteristics mentioned. Based on visual inspection and biological knowledge, the answer is no.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is holding a wooden staff in one hand and standing upright, but its hands are not placed on its chest. Instead, one hand holds the staff, and the other is at its side. A dominant stance often involves placing hands on the chest, as seen in real gorillas during displays of power or territorial behavior. This posture is not present in the Funko Pop! version. The pose is more neutral and ceremonial rather than aggressive or dominant. Therefore, based on visual observation and behavioral knowledge of gorillas, the answer is no.",
