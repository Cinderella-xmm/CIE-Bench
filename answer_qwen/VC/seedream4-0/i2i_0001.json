      "question": "Does the chibi keychain feature a large, singular pearl earring on the girl's left ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style keychain depicts a stylized version of the girl from Vermeer’s 'Girl with a Pearl Earring.' The figure has a single, prominent white circular earring on her left ear, which is consistent with the iconic pearl earring in the original painting. Despite the cartoonish style, the earring is clearly visible and positioned on the left ear, matching the original composition. This visual cue, combined with world knowledge that the original artwork features a single pearl earring on the left ear, supports the conclusion that the chibi keychain retains this detail.",

      "question": "Is the chibi figure wearing a headscarf with distinct blue and yellow sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure wears a headscarf that is clearly divided into two colors: a bright blue section covering the top and front of the head, and a yellow section forming the long trailing part of the scarf. This design mirrors the original painting’s use of blue and yellow in the headscarf, though simplified for the chibi aesthetic. The color division is visually distinct, and the contrast between blue and yellow is maintained, confirming that the headscarf has these two distinct sections.",

      "question": "Does the chibi keychain show the girl dressed in a dark yellow garment with a visible white collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure is wearing a garment that is predominantly yellow, with a darker tone suggesting depth or shadow, consistent with the 'dark yellow' description. Additionally, a white collar is clearly visible at the neckline, extending slightly over the shoulders. This matches both the original painting’s clothing style and the chibi adaptation’s faithful representation of key elements. The combination of yellow attire and white collar aligns with the visual details in the image.",

      "question": "Is the chibi figure depicted with the head turned slightly towards the front, facing the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure's head is oriented such that the face is angled forward, with the eyes looking directly toward the viewer. While the original painting shows the girl turning her head to look back over her shoulder, the chibi version simplifies this pose into a more frontal-facing expression. This change reflects a common stylistic choice in chibi art to make characters appear more approachable and expressive. Thus, the figure is indeed facing the viewer, even if not in the same dynamic pose as the original.",

      "question": "Is the chibi keychain attached to a small silver keyring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi keychain is visibly connected to a metallic ring via a small chain. The ring appears silver in color and is standard in size for a keychain attachment. The presence of the chain and ring confirms it is designed to be attached to keys or bags. This is consistent with typical keychain construction, and the visual evidence supports that the keychain is attached to a small silver keyring.",
