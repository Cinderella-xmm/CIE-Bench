      "question": "Are the industrial structures still positioned on the left side of the image, maintaining their relative arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the industrial structures are clearly visible on the left side of the composition. Despite the artistic transformation into a style reminiscent of Van Gogh's 'Starry Night,' the placement and relative positioning of these buildings—such as the stepped concrete platforms and the elevated structure with windows—remain consistent with their original layout. The visual cues, such as the alignment of the steps and the orientation of the buildings, suggest that their spatial arrangement has been preserved, even though the brushwork and coloration have been stylized. This preservation is likely intentional to maintain the scene’s structural coherence while applying an expressive artistic filter.",

      "question": "Does the road still curve gently through the valley, connecting the industrial area to the rest of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The road in Image B retains its curving trajectory through the valley, extending from the foreground toward the midground and connecting the industrial area on the left to the broader landscape. Although the road is rendered with thick, swirling brushstrokes typical of post-impressionist painting, its path remains recognizable. The continuity of the winding shape, along with its position between the industrial structures and the surrounding snow-covered terrain, indicates that the road’s function and route have not been altered by the artistic transformation. This suggests that the artist aimed to preserve key compositional elements while enhancing the aesthetic expression.",

      "question": "Are there still frosted trees visible along the sides of the valley?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees along both sides of the valley are depicted with white and light blue strokes, simulating frost or snow accumulation on branches. While the rendering is highly stylized—with exaggerated forms and dynamic brushwork—the presence of tree-like structures covered in white is evident. These features align with the appearance of frosted trees in winter scenes. Even though the texture and form are painterly rather than photorealistic, the visual cues (branch patterns, placement along slopes, and white coverage) confirm that frosted trees remain a prominent element in the scene, consistent with the original environment.",

      "question": "Are the distant snow-covered peaks still visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features mountain ranges that extend into the distance, rendered in deep blues, purples, and whites, which evoke snow-covered peaks. Although the sky above them is dramatically stylized with swirling patterns and bright celestial bodies, the silhouette and elevation of the mountains remain discernible. The layered appearance and the use of lighter tones at higher elevations suggest snow cover. Given that the overall composition maintains depth and perspective, the distant peaks are still present and identifiable despite the artistic interpretation. This reflects an intentional preservation of the landscape’s topography within the painted style.",

      "question": "Do the industrial structures still retain their general shape and form despite artistic modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B transforms the scene into a vivid, impressionistic style characterized by bold brushstrokes and vibrant colors, the industrial structures on the left side of the image still maintain their fundamental geometric shapes. Features such as rectangular buildings, vertical chimneys, and stepped platforms are recognizable despite being reinterpreted with swirling lines and contrasting hues. The structural hierarchy—e.g., the elevated building above the terraced base—is preserved, indicating that the artist prioritized retaining the core architectural identity while applying stylistic enhancements. Thus, while the appearance is altered, the general form remains intact.",
