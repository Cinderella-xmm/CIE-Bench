      "question": "Is the \"Fujitsu fi-7160\" model name and logo visibly present on the top-left portion of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic display features a stylized, futuristic rendering of the Fujitsu scanner. The top-left portion of the scanner within the hologram shows a faint representation of the 'Fujitsu' brand name and the 'fi-7160' model designation. Although the image is rendered with glowing effects and digital enhancements, the text appears to be legible and positioned consistently with real-world product labeling conventions. Based on visual cues and common branding practices, where manufacturers place model numbers and logos prominently for identification, it is reasonable to conclude that the model name and logo are present, even if slightly altered by the artistic rendering.",

      "question": "Is the automatic document feeder (ADF) tray open and holding multiple documents, including a boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip, in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ADF tray of the scanner within the holographic display is depicted as open, consistent with its function in real-world use. Inside the tray, three distinct documents are visible: one with a green and white striped design resembling a boarding pass, another labeled 'Receipt', and a third labeled 'Payment Slip'. These elements are clearly distinguishable despite the stylized lighting and digital effects. The arrangement mirrors typical document feeding scenarios, and the presence of these specific document types aligns with common usage cases for such scanners. Therefore, the ADF is shown holding the correct mix of documents.",

      "question": "Are the five control buttons (Menu, Stop/Clear, Scan/Enter, Power, and directional navigation) arranged in the same configuration on the right side of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the control panel on the right side of the scanner in the holographic display shows five buttons: Menu, Stop/Clear, Scan/Enter, Power, and directional navigation (up/down/left/right). The layout matches the standard configuration seen in real-world Fujitsu fi-7160 scanners, where the power button is at the bottom, followed by directional controls, and then the other function buttons above. Despite the futuristic aesthetic and glowing effects, the relative positions and groupings of the buttons remain consistent with the original design. This alignment suggests that the manufacturer's interface design has been preserved in the visualization.",

      "question": "Is the power button illuminated in green on the right-side control panel of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the power button on the right-side control panel of the scanner is clearly depicted with a glowing green light, indicating an active or powered-on state. This matches the behavior of actual Fujitsu scanners, where the power button illuminates green when the device is on. Even though the holographic effect adds a blue and cyan glow around the entire scanner, the green illumination of the power button remains distinct and identifiable. The use of color-coded indicators is a standard feature in electronics, and green typically signifies operational status, reinforcing this interpretation.",

      "question": "Is the row of bristle rollers visible beneath the scanning bed of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area beneath the scanning bed of the scanner is rendered with a translucent, glowing blue grid pattern, which obscures the physical details of the internal components. While in reality, the Fujitsu fi-7160 includes a row of bristle rollers to guide documents through the ADF, these are not clearly visible in the holographic display due to the artistic rendering. The digital effects prioritize aesthetic appeal over technical accuracy, replacing mechanical parts with abstract visual elements. Therefore, based on the visual information, the bristle rollers are not discernible.",

      "question": "Are the boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip clearly visible in the ADF tray with readable text such as \"Boarding Pass\", \"Receipt\", and \"Payment Slip\" in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the documents in the ADF tray are shown with labels such as 'Boarding Pass', 'Receipt', and 'Payment Slip'. However, due to the holographic and stylized nature of the image, the text appears somewhat distorted and blended with the surrounding light effects. While the general shapes and titles are recognizable, the clarity of the text is compromised by the digital rendering. In contrast, in Image A, the same documents are clearly legible. Given that readability is impaired in the holographic version, it cannot be considered fully clear or easily readable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scanner within the holographic display retains the overall shape and structure of the Fujitsu fi-7160, but the color scheme has been significantly altered. Instead of the original matte black and light gray, the scanner is rendered with vibrant blue, purple, and pink hues, along with glowing lines and reflections. These colors are part of the futuristic, digital aesthetic of the hologram and do not reflect the actual physical appearance of the device. While the base form remains consistent, the coloration is purely artistic and deviates from the original design.",
