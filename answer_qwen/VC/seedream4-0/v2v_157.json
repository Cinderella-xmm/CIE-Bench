      "question": "Does the owl retain its brown and white spotted feather pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is depicted with a detailed feather pattern that includes shades of brown and lighter beige or cream tones, consistent with a spotted appearance. The texture and coloration are rendered in a way that matches typical representations of owls with mottled plumage, such as the Eastern Screech-Owl or similar species. This pattern is visually preserved compared to common artistic depictions of scholarly owls. Based on visual cues, the feathers show distinct spots and variations in tone, which align with the description of a brown and white spotted pattern. Therefore, it can be concluded that the owl retains this characteristic.",

      "question": "Are the owl's large yellow eyes and black beak present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl’s facial features are clearly visible. Its eyes are large, round, and distinctly yellow with dark pupils, a common trait in many owl species and often exaggerated in cartoon or symbolic representations for emphasis. The beak is sharp, pointed, and colored black, consistent with typical owl anatomy. These features are not only present but are emphasized to enhance the owl’s scholarly and wise appearance. There is no indication of alteration or omission of these traits. Thus, both the yellow eyes and black beak are present.",

      "question": "Is the owl still wearing a graduation cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The owl in Image B is clearly wearing a dark blue graduation cap (mortarboard) with a tassel hanging from the top. This accessory is a central part of the owl’s scholarly theme, symbolizing academic achievement. The cap is positioned properly on the owl’s head, just as it would be on a human graduate. The presence of the cap is consistent with the overall motif of education and wisdom represented by the owl. Therefore, the graduation cap is indeed still worn by the owl.",

      "question": "Does the owl continue to hold the rolled-up diploma tied with a yellow ribbon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is shown holding a rolled-up scroll in its right talon. The scroll is tied with a yellow ribbon forming a bow, matching the traditional depiction of a diploma or certificate. This detail is consistent with the owl’s role as a symbol of academic success. The scroll is securely held and clearly visible, indicating that the object has not been removed or altered. Hence, the owl continues to hold the diploma as described.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is perched atop a stack of books. Upon close inspection, there are three distinct books visible: one blue on top, one orange in the middle, and one red at the bottom. These books are stacked horizontally and serve as a base for the owl. While the books may appear slightly compressed due to perspective or artistic style, their number remains three. This matches the original configuration seen in Image A and maintains the symbolic representation of knowledge and learning. Therefore, the stack consists of three books.",
