      "question": "Are both the main triangular sail and the smaller jib sail present and correctly positioned on the mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boat is a detailed wooden model with multiple sails. The largest sail, which is triangular and attached to the main mast, is clearly visible and appears to be the main sail. Additionally, there is a smaller triangular sail located forward of the main sail, near the bow, which corresponds to the jib sail. In traditional sailing vessels, especially those resembling ancient or classical designs, the jib sail is typically set forward of the mainmast and angled to catch wind efficiently. The positioning in this image matches that standard configuration. Both sails are properly mounted on the mast system and appear correctly oriented relative to each other and the hull. This aligns with common knowledge of sailboat rigging.",

      "question": "Is there a single vertical mast located centrally along the length of the boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boat features one prominent vertical mast that rises from the center of the hull. This mast supports the main sail and is positioned roughly at the midpoint of the boat's length, consistent with traditional sailing vessel design where the mast is placed centrally for balance and optimal sail performance. While there are additional stays and rigging, only one primary mast is visible. This contrasts with some multi-masted vessels like schooners, but fits the profile of a single-masted traditional craft. The central placement is evident from the symmetry of the deck and the distribution of sails.",

      "question": "Does the boat have a sharply pointed bow extending forward from the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the boat (the bow) is elongated and tapers to a distinct point, forming a sharp projection from the hull. This is characteristic of many traditional sailing vessels designed for cutting through water efficiently. The bow is not blunt or rounded but rather sleek and pointed, which helps reduce drag and improve navigation in open waters. This design feature is consistent with historical boats such as Phoenician or Mediterranean-style ships, which often had such bows. The visual evidence clearly shows a pointed tip extending forward, confirming its presence.",

      "question": "Is there a covered section with open sides and vertical railings located over the midsection of the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the midsection of the boat features a raised structure with open sides and vertical railings, resembling a covered deckhouse or cabin. This area is enclosed on top but has transparent or open sides, allowing visibility and access. The railing consists of evenly spaced vertical bars, typical of decorative or functional safety barriers on ship models. This structure is situated directly over the central part of the hull and appears to serve as a sheltered space for passengers or crew. Such a feature is common in traditional boats for protection from elements while maintaining ventilation and visibility.",

      "question": "Is there a small red flag attached to the stern of the boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon close inspection of the stern (rear) of the boat, there is no visible flag or any colored emblem. The stern is smooth and unadorned, with no attachment points or fabric indicating a flag. Although some boats may carry flags for identification or decoration, none is present here. The absence of any red flag is confirmed by examining the entire rear portion of the vessel. This conclusion is based on direct visual analysis and comparison with typical nautical conventions, where flags are usually mounted on a staff at the stern or bow—neither of which is observed here.",

      "question": "Are the sails, mast, deck, and bow aligned in their original spatial configuration, maintaining the correct proportions and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all components—the sails, mast, deck, and bow—are proportionally accurate and spatially coherent. The mast stands vertically from the center of the deck, supporting sails that are correctly angled and sized relative to the hull. The bow extends naturally forward, and the deck features a symmetrical layout with railings and structural details that align with the boat’s overall form. There is no distortion or misalignment; the model appears to be a faithful representation of a traditional sailing vessel. The lighting and shadows also suggest consistent depth and perspective, reinforcing the correct spatial relationships. This alignment reflects realistic craftsmanship and adherence to known shipbuilding principles.",
