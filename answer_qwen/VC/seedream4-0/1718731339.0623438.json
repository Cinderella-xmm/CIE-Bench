      "question": "Are the two prominent curved horns on top of the helmet still present and retaining their original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is displayed within a glass dome, but the helmet's top features are clearly visible. The two large, curved horns are present and positioned symmetrically on the upper part of the helmet, consistent with typical fantasy armor design where such horns serve both aesthetic and symbolic purposes. Their curvature and placement match common depictions of demonic or warrior-themed helmets. Comparing to Image A, which shows a close-up of the same character, the horns appear identical in shape and positioning—no deformation or repositioning is evident. This consistency suggests that the editing process preserved these key features.",

      "question": "Is the faceplate still skull-shaped with clearly visible, glowing red eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faceplate is visible through the transparent dome. It retains a skull-like structure with pronounced cheekbones and a jawline reminiscent of a skeletal visage. However, due to the lighting conditions inside the display case and the angle of view, the eyes do not appear to be glowing red as they might in a dynamic or lit environment. In contrast, Image A shows the character under direct lighting where the red eyes are distinctly illuminated, suggesting that the glow effect may have been lost or subdued in the display version. Thus, while the skull shape is preserved, the glowing red eyes are not clearly visible in this context.",

      "question": "Do the shoulder pauldrons retain their large, spiked structure and the red vein-like patterns embedded within them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoulder pauldrons are clearly visible and maintain their bulky, spiked appearance, consistent with the aggressive design seen in Image A. The spikes extend outward in a menacing fashion, and upon closer inspection, faint red lines resembling veins or circuitry can be observed running across the surface of the pauldrons. These details align with the biomechanical theme often found in dark fantasy or cyberpunk aesthetics. The scale and pattern match those in Image A, indicating that the structural and decorative elements were preserved during the transformation into a collectible display piece.",

      "question": "Does the chest armor maintain its segmented, layered design with visible rivets and mechanical joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chest armor in Image B displays a multi-layered construction with distinct horizontal plates that mimic musculature, a hallmark of heavily armored fantasy characters. Upon examination, small circular rivets and articulated joints between segments are visible, especially along the edges and midline. These mechanical details suggest mobility and durability, consistent with functional armor design. Compared to Image A, where these features are more prominently highlighted due to closer perspective and lighting, Image B still preserves the same architectural layout and detail level, albeit slightly less emphasized due to distance and ambient lighting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure’s hands are positioned at its sides, and the gauntlets are clearly visible. They feature elongated, sharp fingertips that resemble claws, typical of warrior or demon-inspired armor. The overall form of the gauntlets matches the aggressive styling seen in Image A, where the claws are even more pronounced due to closer framing. Despite being viewed from a greater distance in Image B, the silhouette and structure confirm that the clawed design has been retained without modification.",

      "question": "Is the original weathered and scarred texture of the armor still visible across the chest, shoulders, and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor in Image B exhibits signs of wear, including scratches, dents, and discoloration, particularly noticeable on the chest plate and shoulder areas. These imperfections contribute to a battle-worn aesthetic, consistent with the weathered look seen in Image A. While the lighting in the display case may soften some textures, the overall patina and scarring remain apparent, especially when compared to the pristine surfaces one might expect in an unblemished model. The presence of rust-like tones and uneven surface finishes supports the conclusion that the original weathered texture has been preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the full-body figure is presented in a standing pose within the glass dome. Its proportions—head size relative to torso, arm length compared to body height—are consistent with those in Image A. The muscular build, broad shoulders, and relatively smaller head maintain the imposing, balanced silhouette characteristic of powerful armored warriors. Even though the scale is reduced due to the display format, the anatomical relationships remain accurate, suggesting no distortion occurred during the modeling or presentation process.",
