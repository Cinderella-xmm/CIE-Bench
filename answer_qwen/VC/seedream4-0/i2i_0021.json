      "question": "Are the three sheep positioned near each other, with one adult sheep interacting closely with the two younger ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three chibi-style sheep are visually grouped together in close proximity. The adult sheep (the one on the left wearing a red scarf) is standing slightly apart but still within the same frame as the two smaller sheep. The two younger sheep are positioned near the adult, with one of them leaning toward it, suggesting interaction. Although the scene is stylized, the spatial arrangement indicates that they are near each other and engaged in a social dynamic typical of a caregiver-young relationship. This aligns with common animal behavior where adult sheep interact closely with lambs. The positioning supports the idea of closeness and interaction.",

      "question": "Do the chibi sheep maintain their original postures, with the adult sheep standing upright and the younger ones leaning towards it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the adult chibi sheep stands upright on all four legs, facing forward with a calm posture, consistent with a stationary adult animal. The two younger sheep are depicted in slightly different orientations: one leans its head toward the adult, while the other appears to be walking or turning, possibly approaching. Their postures suggest movement and engagement, but not rigidly fixed like the adult. While the adult maintains an upright stance, the younger ones do not uniformly lean toward it; instead, one is leaning and the other is angled differently. However, the overall impression is one of interaction, even if not perfectly symmetrical. Given the stylized nature of chibi art, slight deviations from exact postures are acceptable, but the general intent of leaning and interaction is preserved.",

      "question": "Do the chibi sheep retain identifiable sheep-like body proportions, such as a rounded body and small legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi sheep in Image B are stylized cartoon versions, but they clearly maintain key features of real sheep. They have large, rounded bodies with fluffy wool textures, short legs relative to their body size, and proportionally small heads with large eyes—typical of chibi art style. Despite the exaggeration for cuteness, the basic anatomical structure of sheep is preserved: a bulky torso, short limbs, and a distinct woolly appearance. These proportions are consistent with how sheep are commonly represented in simplified or cartoon forms, especially in children’s media. Therefore, even though exaggerated, the body proportions remain recognizable as sheep-like.",

      "question": "Is there a visible interaction displayed between the adult chibi sheep and the two younger ones, suggesting care or attention?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, there is a clear visual suggestion of interaction. The adult chibi sheep is positioned prominently, facing the viewer, while the two younger ones are oriented toward it—one leaning its head close to the adult, and the other positioned nearby as if following or seeking attention. In animal behavior, such proximity and orientation often indicate care or bonding, especially between adults and offspring. Additionally, the adult sheep's calm expression and central placement reinforce its role as a guardian figure. The artistic choice to place the young sheep near the adult and show physical closeness implies nurturing behavior, which is consistent with how sheep interact in real life. Even in a stylized form, this interaction is evident.",

      "question": "Do the chibi sheep retain a representation of their woolly texture, even in a stylized or simplified manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, despite the simplified and cartoonish design, the chibi sheep clearly represent woolly texture. Their bodies are outlined with soft, cloud-like edges and filled with white or off-white coloration that mimics fleece. The fluffy appearance is emphasized through curved lines and layered shapes, particularly around the neck and back, which are characteristic of wool. In chibi art, texture is often implied rather than detailed, and here it is effectively conveyed through shape and shading. The use of outlines and voluminous forms suggests thickness and fluffiness, consistent with real sheep's wool. Thus, even in a stylized format, the woolly texture is preserved and recognizable.",
