      "question": "Is the \"CRAFT\" logo present on the upper right shoulder of the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is a bust mounted on a metallic stand. The upper right shoulder area (from the viewer's perspective) clearly displays the word 'CRAFT' in white capital letters, accompanied by a small dot pattern logo typical of the CRAFT brand. This placement matches standard apparel branding where logos are often positioned on the shoulder or chest area for visibility. Based on visual inspection, the logo is present and legible. This conclusion is supported by common design practices in athletic wear, where brands like CRAFT place their logos prominently on the shoulder region.",

      "question": "Is the stylized \"Z\" logo with red, white, and blue diagonal stripes present on the left chest of the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The left chest area of the figurine in Image B features a prominent logo shaped like a stylized 'Z'. The design includes diagonal stripes in red, white, and blue, which are clearly visible and consistent with the color scheme of the American flag. This type of design is often used in sports or healthcare-related branding to convey national identity or professionalism. The logo's position on the left chest aligns with typical placement for team or corporate emblems on athletic apparel. Therefore, based on visual evidence and common branding conventions, the logo is present and correctly described.",

      "question": "Is the word \"healthcare\" in lowercase white letters with a red outline located directly beneath the \"Z\" logo on the left chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close examination of the left chest area in Image B, directly beneath the stylized 'Z' logo, there is text that reads 'healthcare'. The font is in lowercase white letters, and it appears to have a thin red outline, matching the description provided. This detail is consistent with branding elements seen in medical or health-focused organizations, where such text is used to denote affiliation or purpose. The alignment and styling match typical logo design standards for clarity and brand recognition. Thus, the presence and formatting of the text are confirmed.",

      "question": "Are the black-framed glasses with tortoiseshell-patterned temples visible on the figurine’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B has facial features including a pair of glasses. The frames are black, and the temples (the arms extending over the ears) exhibit a tortoiseshell pattern, characterized by a mottled mix of dark brown and amber tones. This style is commonly associated with classic eyewear designs. The glasses are clearly visible and accurately rendered, suggesting attention to detail in the figurine's creation. Given the clarity of the image and the distinctiveness of the tortoiseshell pattern, this feature can be confidently identified.",

      "question": "Is the reddish-brown beard and mustache clearly visible on the figurine’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial hair on the figurine in Image B consists of a full beard and mustache that are distinctly reddish-brown in color. The texture and shading suggest careful sculpting to mimic natural hair growth patterns. The beard covers the cheeks and chin, while the mustache extends across the upper lip, both appearing well-defined and consistent with the original person's grooming style. This level of detail indicates that the figurine was designed to closely resemble the individual, making the facial hair clearly visible and accurately represented.",

      "question": "Is the \"CRAFT\" logo positioned on the upper right shoulder and the \"Z healthcare\" logo on the left chest of the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'CRAFT' logo is indeed located on the upper right shoulder of the figurine, as observed in the previous analysis. Additionally, the 'Z healthcare' logo is positioned on the left chest, directly below the collarbone, which is a standard location for team or organizational logos on athletic apparel. Both placements align with typical branding conventions in sportswear. The spatial arrangement of these logos is consistent with how they would appear on a real garment, confirming that both logos are in their correct positions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B is mounted on a vertical metallic stand and is positioned upright, with its head and torso aligned vertically. It faces directly forward, toward the viewer, mirroring the frontal orientation seen in Image A. The symmetry of the pose, the straight posture, and the direct gaze suggest that the figurine was designed to replicate the original subject's stance accurately. While Image A shows a full-body view, the figurine maintains the same forward-facing direction and upright posture, indicating faithful reproduction of the original stance.",
