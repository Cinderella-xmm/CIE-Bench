    "Question": "Q1: Does the butterfly retain its original iridescent electric blue wing color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is depicted as a line drawing with no color fill. The wings are outlined in black and white, lacking any coloration. Based on visual cues, the iridescent electric blue color seen in typical morpho butterflies (such as those in Image A) is absent here. Instead, the image uses a schematic or anatomical illustration style, which prioritizes structure over realistic color representation. Therefore, the original vibrant blue color is not retained.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the dark black edges along the outer margins of the butterflyâ€™s wings preserved?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings are illustrated with clear black outlines that define their shape and venation. These outlines include the outer margins, which appear darker than the rest of the wing structure, consistent with the natural dark borders seen in many butterfly species like the morpho. Although the image is monochromatic, the contrast between the edge lines and the inner wing areas suggests that the dark black edges are preserved in the outline form. This matches the structural accuracy often found in biological illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the butterfly depicted with both wings fully extended and symmetrically open?",
    "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B shows both forewings and hindwings fully spread out, forming a symmetrical, bilaterally balanced shape. The wings are positioned horizontally, mirroring each other in size and angle, which is typical for resting butterflies in scientific diagrams. The symmetry and full extension are clearly visible in the line art, indicating an intentional depiction of the butterfly in a standard anatomical pose. This aligns with common conventions in biological illustrations to show full wing structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the bright pink cosmos flower directly beneath the butterfly still present and clearly visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pink cosmos flower beneath the butterfly remains visually prominent. Its petals are fully rendered in color, maintaining the same bright pink hue and petal arrangement as in Image A. The flower is centrally located under the butterfly and is clearly distinguishable despite the overlay of the line-drawn butterfly. The presence of the flower is consistent with the original composition, suggesting it has not been removed or obscured.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the yellow stamens forming the central disc of the pink flower visible?",
    "explanation": "The central part of the pink cosmos flower in Image B includes small yellow structures that represent the stamens. These are clustered at the center of the flower, forming a distinct disc-like pattern. While slightly less detailed than in a photograph, they are clearly identifiable as yellow stamens, consistent with the anatomy of cosmos flowers. Their visibility confirms that the reproductive parts of the flower have been preserved in the illustration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the butterfly physically touching the surface of the pink flower?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly appears to be hovering just above the flower, with no visible point of contact between its body or legs and the flower petals. The positioning suggests a slight gap between the butterfly and the flower, typical of illustrative representations where spatial relationships are emphasized for clarity. There is no indication of physical contact, such as overlapping limbs or shadows suggesting pressure. Thus, based on visual cues, the butterfly is not touching the flower.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q7: Are multiple unopened pink flower buds visible around the main flower?",
    "explanation": "Several unopened pink flower buds are visible in Image B, surrounding the main cosmos flower. These buds are shown in various stages of development, with some appearing tightly closed and others slightly swollen. They are positioned on thin green stems, consistent with the natural growth pattern of cosmos plants. Their presence adds depth and realism to the scene, reinforcing the garden setting. The number and placement match what would be expected in a natural floral arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the background composed of softly blurred green leaves, maintaining a natural garden ambiance?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B features a soft-focus effect with green foliage, creating a bokeh-like appearance that enhances the depth of field. The green hues and leaf shapes suggest a natural garden environment, consistent with the original image. Although the focus is on the butterfly and flower, the blurred greenery provides context and maintains the serene, outdoor ambiance. This artistic choice preserves the naturalistic feel even though the butterfly itself is stylized.",
    "answer": "Yes"
