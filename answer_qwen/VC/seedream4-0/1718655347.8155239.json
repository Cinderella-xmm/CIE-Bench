      "question": "Is there a large, circular, reddish celestial body located in the upper left portion of the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper left portion of the sky contains a large, circular object that is clearly embroidered with concentric rings of red and gold thread. This design resembles a stylized sun or moon, but due to its placement and coloration (red at the center with golden outer rings), it appears more like a symbolic representation of a celestial body, possibly a stylized sun or a red moon. The use of embroidery techniques such as satin stitch and outline stitching gives it a distinct, non-photorealistic appearance. Based on visual cues and common artistic representations, this circular form can be interpreted as a celestial body. Its position in the upper left quadrant of the sky matches the description. Although it's not a realistic depiction of a moon, it is consistent with the concept of a large, circular, reddish celestial body.",

      "question": "Is there a prominent mountain range with snow-covered peaks spanning the background behind the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a detailed embroidered landscape where a mountain range dominates the background. The mountains are rendered using white and light beige threads for the snow-covered peaks, contrasted with dark blue and gray threads to define the ridges and shadows. The geometric patterns and layered stitching suggest steep, jagged peaks typical of alpine terrain. The scale and positioning of the mountains indicate they span across the entire width behind the lake, forming a continuous backdrop. The use of embroidery techniques like running stitch and satin stitch adds depth and texture, reinforcing the perception of elevation and snow cover. Given the visual evidence and common embroidery conventions for depicting natural landscapes, this is clearly a prominent, snow-capped mountain range.",

      "question": "Is there a large, reflective body of water occupying the central foreground of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central area of the composition is dominated by a body of water stitched with varying shades of blue and white thread. The surface is depicted with swirling, curved lines that mimic ripples and reflections, suggesting movement and fluidity. The use of different thread textures and densities creates the illusion of depth and reflection. The water extends from the midground into the foreground, bordered by landmasses on both sides. This arrangement places the lake prominently in the lower half of the image, fulfilling the role of a large, reflective body of water in the central foreground. The technique used—such as satin stitch and long stitches—enhances the sense of liquid motion and reflectivity.",

      "question": "Are there clusters of red-colored trees lining both banks of the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two rows of trees along the edges of the lake, one on each bank. These trees are embroidered using bright red thread, with simple, stylized shapes resembling coniferous or deciduous trees. On the left side, several red trees are grouped together near the shoreline. On the right side, a similar cluster of red trees is visible, though partially cut off by the frame. The consistent use of red thread and uniform shape suggests intentional artistic emphasis on these trees. Their placement along the lake’s edge confirms that they line both banks. While the style is abstract rather than realistic, the visual cues strongly support the presence of red-colored tree clusters on both sides.",

      "question": "Does the surface of the lake reflect the red moon and the snow-capped mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the lake in Image B is stitched with swirling patterns of blue, white, and silver threads, which simulate water movement and reflections. However, upon close inspection, there is no clear, coherent reflection of the red celestial body (which is stylized and not fully circular like a moon) or the snow-capped mountains. The reflections appear more abstract and generalized, with no distinct mirror image of the moon or mountain peaks. In contrast, realistic reflections would show inverted images of the surrounding elements. Since the embroidery uses stylized, non-literal techniques, the reflection lacks detail and specificity. Therefore, while the water has reflective qualities, it does not accurately depict the reflection of the red moon or the mountains.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the foreground of Image B, the shoreline is depicted with textured stitching using earthy tones—browns, tans, and grays—to represent rocky terrain. There are small, rounded shapes stitched in gray and white, resembling stones or boulders scattered along the edge of the lake. Additionally, areas of white thread are used to suggest patches of snow, particularly near the base of the mountains and along the shorelines. The combination of these elements—rock-like forms and white thread accents—indicates the presence of both rocks and snow patches. The embroidery style emphasizes texture and contrast, making these features distinguishable despite the stylized nature of the artwork.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular celestial body (stylized as a red and gold sun or moon) is located in the upper left portion of the sky, clearly elevated above the mountain range and the lake below. The mountains occupy the middle ground, and the lake lies in the foreground, so the celestial body is spatially positioned higher than both. This vertical arrangement places it above the entire landscape, consistent with the typical perspective of a celestial object in the sky. Although the object is stylized and not photorealistic, its placement relative to the other elements confirms that it is situated above the mountain range and the lake.",
