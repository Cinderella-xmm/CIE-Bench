      "question": "Are the refrigerators depicted with a stainless steel finish and reflective surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both refrigerators exhibit a metallic sheen consistent with stainless steel appliances. The surface reflects ambient light from the kitchen environment, including overhead lighting and natural light from the windows, indicating a smooth, polished finish typical of stainless steel. Additionally, the way the light gradients across the doors—darker at the top and lighter toward the bottom—suggests a brushed or matte-finished stainless steel rather than a highly polished mirror-like one, which is common in modern appliance design. This visual cue, combined with world knowledge that stainless steel is the standard material for high-end refrigerators due to its durability and aesthetic appeal, supports the conclusion that the refrigerators have a stainless steel finish with a reflective surface texture.",

      "question": "Do both refrigerators retain the double-door design with water/ice dispensers located on the freezer compartments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each refrigerator in Image B clearly features two vertical doors, confirming the double-door design. The left door of each unit contains an integrated water and ice dispenser, positioned in the upper portion of the door, which is characteristic of French door refrigerators where the freezer compartment is typically on the left side. This placement aligns with standard appliance design conventions, where the dispenser is mounted on the freezer door to allow for cold air retention and ease of access. The presence of control panels above the dispensers further confirms this configuration. Based on visual inspection and general knowledge of refrigerator layouts, the design matches the expected layout of a French door model with built-in dispensers on the freezer side.",

      "question": "Are the refrigerators displayed in their original proportions and sizes relative to each other, without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both refrigerators appear visually identical in height, width, and depth, suggesting they are the same model and size. Their alignment within the kitchen space, relative to surrounding cabinets and countertops, maintains consistent scaling. There is no visible warping, stretching, or shrinking of either unit, and the perspective appears symmetrical and proportionally accurate. The spacing between them and adjacent cabinetry remains uniform, reinforcing that there is no digital distortion. Furthermore, when comparing to typical refrigerator dimensions and kitchen layout standards, the units fit naturally into the space without appearing oversized or undersized. Thus, based on visual cues and architectural consistency, the refrigerators are displayed in their original proportions and sizes.",

      "question": "Are the control panels and water/ice dispensers positioned correctly on the freezer doors, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the control panels and water/ice dispensers are located on the left-hand door of each refrigerator, which corresponds to the freezer compartment in a French door design. The placement is centered vertically and horizontally on the upper half of the door, which is standard for such appliances. The control panel is positioned directly above the dispenser, with a clear interface and lever mechanism, matching real-world designs like those from brands such as Samsung or LG. Comparing this to the original image (Image A), the positioning remains consistent—no rotation, misalignment, or repositioning is observed. The symmetry and alignment with the cabinet structure also support that the components are correctly placed. Therefore, based on both visual analysis and known appliance design norms, the controls and dispensers are positioned accurately.",

      "question": "Do the cabinets above the refrigerators retain their dark gray shaker-style design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cabinets above the refrigerators in Image B are dark gray in color and feature recessed panel doors with clean, straight edges and simple hardware, which are defining characteristics of the shaker-style cabinet design. This style is commonly used in modern kitchens for its minimalist and timeless appearance. The cabinets maintain consistent sizing and alignment with the refrigerators below, and their finish appears uniform, matching the lower cabinets in the kitchen. Upon comparison with Image A, the design, color, and style remain unchanged, confirming that the cabinets have not been altered. The use of round knobs and flat-panel construction further supports the identification as shaker-style. Thus, based on visual cues and design knowledge, the cabinets retain their original dark gray shaker-style design.",
