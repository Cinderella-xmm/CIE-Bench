      "question": "Are the two visible dark brown wooden ceiling beams, one running diagonally and one vertically, present and positioned as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a fantastical, glowing jellyfish underwater with no visible ceiling, beams, or architectural elements. The scene is entirely aquatic, featuring deep blue water, bioluminescent patterns on the jellyfish, and star-like lights along its tentacles. There are no wooden structures or ceiling beams present. Since Image A (the original) contains wooden ceiling beams, and Image B does not contain any such elements, it is clear that the beams are absent in the edited image. Therefore, the answer must be 'No'.",

      "question": "Is the white, hand-textured stucco wall visible on the left side of the image, showing irregular surface imperfections and subtle brushwork marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of deep ocean water with a gradient from lighter blue at the top to darker blue at the bottom. There is no solid wall, let alone a white, textured stucco wall. The environment is underwater, and the only visible structures are parts of the jellyfish and faint coral-like formations in the distance. In contrast, Image A features a clearly visible white stucco wall with texture. Since Image B lacks any terrestrial or architectural surfaces, the presence of the stucco wall is impossible here. Thus, the answer is 'No'.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shadow pattern on the ceiling and wall composed of a radial, star-shaped lattice formed by the lantern’s cut-out design, matching the exact geometric configuration of the lantern’s panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an underwater scene with a luminous jellyfish emitting colorful light and star-like glows. There is no ceiling, wall, or lantern present, so no shadow patterns can be cast. The lighting effect comes from the jellyfish itself, creating a soft glow and sparkling stars along its tentacles, but no geometric shadows resembling a lantern's cut-outs. In Image A, such shadows are present due to the intricate metalwork of the lantern. Since Image B has no such structure or surface for shadows to form on, the answer must be 'No'.",

      "question": "Is the corner where the white wall meets the wooden ceiling clearly visible, forming a sharp right-angle edge at the upper left portion of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any walls or ceilings. It is an underwater scene dominated by a glowing jellyfish floating in the ocean. There are no architectural elements, corners, or right-angle edges visible. The upper left portion of the image shows water surface reflections and light diffusion, not structural corners. In contrast, Image A clearly shows the junction between the wall and ceiling. Since this feature is absent in Image B, the answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Is the metal chain, consisting of small linked rings, visibly connecting the top of the lantern to the ceiling fixture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no lantern, ceiling fixture, or metal chain. Instead, the image features a surreal jellyfish with glowing tentacles and decorative swirls. There are no mechanical or hanging components present. The entire composition is organic and aquatic. In Image A, a metal chain is clearly visible linking the lantern to the ceiling. Since Image B lacks any such object or structure, the chain is not present. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the light emanate from within the central chamber of the lantern, creating a bright focal point that radiates outward through the perforated panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a jellyfish whose light appears to originate from within its bell and tentacles, creating a radiant, ethereal glow. However, this is not a lantern; it is a biological organism with bioluminescent properties. While there is internal illumination, it does not come from a central chamber with perforated panels, nor does it project geometric patterns like a lantern would. In Image A, the lantern emits light through its ornate cut-outs, creating a focused glow. In Image B, the light source is diffuse and organic, not structured like a lantern. Thus, although there is internal light, it does not match the described lantern mechanism. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",
