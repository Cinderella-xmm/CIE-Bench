      "question": "Is the black cast-iron teapot with a curved handle and domed lid present in the same position on the left side of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black cast-iron teapot with a curved handle and domed lid is indeed visible on the left side of the table. Its position appears consistent with the original image (Image A), as it rests on a wooden tray or mat in the same general area. The visual cues—such as the shape, color, and placement relative to other objects like the tea bowl and chopsticks—indicate that it has not been moved significantly. Based on world knowledge, such teapots are typically placed on the left for traditional tea ceremonies, which aligns with this setup. Comparing with Image A, the teapot's position remains unchanged, reinforcing the conclusion that it is in the same location.",

      "question": "Is the dark ceramic tea bowl filled with dark liquid located on a wooden tray to the right of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark ceramic tea bowl containing a dark liquid is clearly visible on a wooden tray. This tray is positioned to the right of the teapot, maintaining spatial consistency with typical tea ceremony arrangements where the bowl is placed opposite the teapot. The presence of the wooden tray beneath the bowl is confirmed by its texture and rectangular shape, matching the style seen in traditional Japanese tea settings. When comparing with Image A, the bowl and tray remain in the same relative positions, suggesting no significant repositioning. Therefore, the description matches both images.",

      "question": "Is the matte gray ceramic vase containing cherry blossom branches with pink flowers located at the upper right corner of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the matte gray ceramic vase holding cherry blossom branches with pink flowers is situated in the upper right corner of the table. The visual positioning is consistent with traditional Japanese aesthetics, where floral arrangements are often placed in corners to enhance balance and harmony. The vase’s placement relative to the teapot and tea bowl supports this interpretation. Comparing with Image A, the vase remains in the same location, confirming that its position has not changed. Thus, the answer is supported by both visual evidence and cultural context.",

      "question": "Are the two rectangular wooden trays with engraved bamboo leaf patterns present beneath the teapot and tea bowl respectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two rectangular wooden trays beneath the teapot and tea bowl. However, upon closer inspection, the tray under the teapot appears to be a woven bamboo mat rather than a solid wooden tray with engraved bamboo leaf patterns. The tray under the tea bowl does have a wood-like appearance but lacks clear engraved bamboo leaf designs. In contrast, Image A shows both trays with distinct engraved bamboo leaf patterns. Therefore, while trays are present, the specific detail of engraved bamboo leaf patterns is not consistently accurate in Image B. This discrepancy suggests that the trays in Image B differ from those in Image A.",

      "question": "Are multiple soft pink cherry blossom petals visibly suspended in the air above and around the vase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several soft pink cherry blossom petals are visible floating in the air above and around the vase. These petals appear to be gently drifting, creating a dynamic and serene atmosphere typical of springtime scenes in Japanese art. The visual effect is enhanced by the lighting and shadows, giving the impression of movement. This detail is also present in Image A, where the same petal arrangement can be observed. Therefore, based on visual cues and cultural symbolism (cherry blossoms representing transience and beauty), the presence of these petals is confirmed in both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two dark wooden chopsticks are indeed placed diagonally across the lower right portion of the table. Their orientation runs from the bottom-left toward the top-right, forming a diagonal line. This placement is consistent with traditional Japanese dining etiquette, where chopsticks are often laid out neatly beside the dishware. Comparing with Image A, the chopsticks are in the same position, indicating no change in their arrangement. The visual clarity and alignment confirm their placement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table is covered with a beige fabric that displays a repeating pattern of faint circular motifs. These circles vary slightly in tone and size, contributing to a subtle, textured appearance. This design is consistent with traditional Japanese textiles used in tea ceremonies, emphasizing simplicity and elegance. Upon comparison with Image A, the same fabric pattern is visible, confirming that the table covering has not changed. The visual continuity between the two images supports this conclusion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor is clearly made of woven tatami mats, identifiable by their textured surface and natural beige color. A green border runs along the edges of the mats, which is characteristic of traditional Japanese flooring. Additionally, a long patterned runner is visible along the edge of the table, extending from the foreground into the background. This runner features a geometric or floral design, adding contrast to the otherwise minimalist setting. Comparing with Image A, both the tatami mats and the runner are present in identical configurations, confirming that the floor setup remains unchanged.",
