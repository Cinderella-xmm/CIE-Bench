      "question": "Is the central desk still present with its organ-like structure including vertical pipes and a keyboard-like row of keys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central desk is clearly visible and retains its ornate, organ-like structure. The vertical pipes resembling organ pipes are present above the keyboard-like row of keys, which are arranged in a manner consistent with a musical instrument or an antique typewriter. This design element is preserved from the original image, suggesting continuity in the room's core aesthetic. The presence of these features is confirmed by their distinct shape and positioning on the desk, which aligns with common visual representations of vintage or gothic-style desks with musical motifs.",

      "question": "Is the arched window with a fan-shaped stained-glass upper section and patterned lower panes still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window area has undergone a significant change. Instead of the arched window with a fan-shaped stained-glass upper section and patterned lower panes seen in Image A, there is now a dark curtain covering the window space. Behind this curtain, a shadowy silhouette of a man in a trench coat and hat is projected, creating a mysterious atmosphere. This indicates that the window itself is no longer visible, having been replaced or obscured by the curtain. Therefore, the original architectural feature of the window is absent.",

      "question": "Are the two Corinthian columns with ornate capitals still positioned on either side of the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the window is now covered by a curtain, the structural elements flanking it—specifically the two tall columns—are still visible. These columns retain their classical design, featuring ornate capitals characteristic of the Corinthian order. Their placement on either side of the curtain-covered window area suggests they remain in position, maintaining the symmetry and architectural grandeur of the room. Thus, despite the changes to the window, the columns appear unchanged in both form and location.",

      "question": "Are the tall bookshelves on both sides of the room still fully stocked with uniformly bound leather books?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelves on both sides of the room are still present and appear to be filled with books. The spines of the books are uniformly colored, suggesting they are bound in leather, consistent with the aesthetic of a traditional library or study. There is no visible gap or missing section in the shelves, indicating that they remain fully stocked. This matches the appearance in Image A, where the same orderly arrangement was observed. No evidence suggests any removal or rearrangement of the books.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desk still contains several items: an open book lies flat on the surface, a quill rests in an inkwell to the right, and a lit candelabra with two candles is visible on the left side of the desk. These objects are consistent with those seen in Image A, though the lighting has shifted due to the darker ambiance created by the curtain and shadow figure. The presence and placement of these items suggest continuity in the scene’s composition, even as the overall mood has changed.",

      "question": "Are the scattered parchments and rolled scrolls still visible on the stone floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple pieces of parchment and rolled scrolls are visible on the floor beneath the desk. These papers are arranged similarly to those in Image A, with some lying flat and others curled. Additionally, a magnifying glass is now present among them, which was not in the original image. However, the presence of the parchments and scrolls remains consistent, reinforcing the theme of a scholarly or investigative setting. Thus, despite the addition of new elements, the original scattered documents are still visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor beneath the desk and chair shows a dark, textured surface with a repeating geometric pattern, consistent with the stone tile design seen in Image A. The tiles are arranged in a symmetrical layout, and the shadows cast by the desk and chair confirm the presence of a solid, structured floor. Although the lighting is dimmer in Image B, the pattern remains discernible, indicating that the flooring has not been altered.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling retains its intricate design, featuring a coffered pattern with decorative molding. The square recessed panels and ornate detailing along the edges are consistent with the architectural style seen in Image A. While the lighting is more subdued in Image B, the ceiling structure is still clearly visible, particularly around the perimeter and above the desk area. This confirms that the ceiling has not been modified or removed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upholstered chair with a wooden frame is indeed still located to the left of the desk, matching its position in Image A. Its fabric appears slightly worn, and it maintains the same orientation relative to the desk. There is no indication that it has been moved or replaced, and its presence contributes to the room’s historical and scholarly ambiance. Thus, the chair remains in place.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object previously identified as a knife in Image A is no longer visible. Instead, a magnifying glass has been placed on one of the parchments on the floor. This substitution suggests that the knife has been removed or replaced as part of the narrative shift introduced by the shadow figure and the title 'The Lost Legacy.' The presence of the magnifying glass implies a focus on investigation or discovery, altering the symbolic meaning of the scene. Therefore, the knife is not present in Image B.",
