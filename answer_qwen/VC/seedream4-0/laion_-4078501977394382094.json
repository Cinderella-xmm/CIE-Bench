      "question": "Is the vanâ€™s body primarily green with a cream-colored roof and beige trim along the lower edge and windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the van is shown in three panels. In all panels, the main body of the van is clearly green. The roof is cream-colored, consistent across all frames. Additionally, there is visible beige trim along the lower edge of the van and around the windows, which matches the description. This design is typical of vintage camper vans like the Volkswagen Type 2, often stylized with such color schemes in illustrations. The visual cues across all panels confirm this color scheme.",

      "question": "Is there a wooden luggage rack mounted on the roof of the van?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the van has a structure on its roof that resembles a luggage rack. It is made of wood-like material with a grid pattern, consistent with a wooden luggage rack commonly seen on vintage camper vans. This feature is visible in all three panels, especially in the first panel where it is clearly outlined against the sky. The presence of this rack is supported by both visual detail and common design elements of such vehicles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The van in Image B features a classic rounded front design, characteristic of vintage camper vans. In each panel, the front of the van displays two large windshield windows side by side, separated by a central pillar. This configuration is typical of the Volkswagen Type 2, and the rounded shape is clearly depicted in the illustration. The design aligns with real-world knowledge of these vehicles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, particularly in the first and second panels, the front of the van shows two round headlights, one on each side of the grille. Below them, a shiny, reflective bumper is visible, which appears chrome-like in color and finish. These features are consistent with the design of classic camper vans. The depiction matches known styling elements, even in cartoon form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the van in a series of panels using a front-facing or slightly angled view, not an isometric (top-down angled) perspective. While the first panel shows some depth, the van is viewed more from the front and side rather than from above at an angle. An isometric view would show equal foreshortening of all three axes, which is not present here. Instead, the van is illustrated in a standard cartoon-style frontal or three-quarter view.",

      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image warm tones such as yellow, green, and brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a palette dominated by warm tones. The desert background is yellow and sandy beige, the cacti are green and brown, and the van itself combines green, cream, and beige. These colors are consistent with a desert environment and contribute to a warm, sunny atmosphere. Even the water in the third panel uses warm-toned surrounding vegetation. The overall color scheme supports the use of warm tones.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the first and second panels depict the desert environment with multiple cacti. In the first panel, one large cactus is visible behind the van. In the second panel, another prominent cactus is shown spouting water. In the third panel, additional cacti are visible near the oasis. Across the panels, there are at least four distinct cacti, all stylized and brownish-green in color. Thus, the condition of 'at least three' is met.",
