    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the sofa features multiple cushions.

    "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa is centered beneath the framed painting on the wall. The alignment appears symmetrical, with the center of the sofa directly under the center of the artwork. This positioning is common in interior design to create balance and harmony in a living space.

    "Question": "Q4: Is the room still illuminated by natural light coming from the right side?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows distinct shadows cast diagonally across the floor and wall from the right side of the frame, indicating a light source entering from that direction. The pattern of light and shadow suggests sunlight streaming through a window or opening on the right, creating soft highlights on the sofa and the wall. This lighting behavior is consistent with natural daylight coming from the right side. The angle and clarity of the shadows support this conclusion, as artificial lighting typically produces less directional or more diffused patterns.",

This matches the description of a light herringbone-patterned floor. The consistency of the pattern and material is evident throughout, confirming it remains unchanged.",
