      "question": "Is the cat’s fur predominantly orange with white markings on the chest, chin, and muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's fur is clearly visible and exhibits a rich orange coloration across its body, particularly on the back, sides, and head. The chest, chin, and muzzle areas are distinctly white, forming a contrasting pattern typical of many domestic long-haired cats such as Persians or Maine Coons. This coloration is consistent with common feline coat patterns where white markings appear in facial and chest regions. The visual evidence strongly supports the presence of both orange and white fur in these specific areas. Therefore, based on the visual cues and typical cat fur patterns, the description matches.",

      "question": "Is the cat sitting upright with its head tilted upward, gazing toward the sky through the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat in Image B is seated in an upright posture, with its body facing forward but its head turned slightly upward and angled toward the upper part of the window. Its gaze is directed outward and upward, consistent with looking at the sky or something above the horizon line outside. The positioning of the eyes and the tilt of the head suggest attention toward the upper portion of the view through the window. This behavior aligns with typical feline curiosity when observing birds or movement in the sky. Thus, the cat appears to be gazing upward through the window.",

      "question": "Does the window consist of six rectangular panes arranged in a 2x3 grid with white frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the window in Image B, it features multiple glass panes separated by muntins. Counting the panes reveals two vertical columns and three horizontal rows, totaling six rectangular panes. These are evenly spaced and framed in white, matching the architectural style of traditional sash windows. The arrangement is clearly a 2x3 grid, which is a common design for such windows. There are no deviations in shape or number, so the description accurately reflects the structure.",

      "question": "Is the sky visible through the window a solid, clear blue without significant cloud cover?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Through the window in Image B, the sky is visible and displays a vibrant blue hue. While there are faint, wispy clouds near the horizon, they do not constitute significant cloud cover. The majority of the visible sky area is unobstructed and uniformly blue, indicating clear weather conditions. In real-world terms, this suggests a sunny day with minimal atmospheric interference. Therefore, the sky can be described as largely clear and solidly blue.",

      "question": "Is there a cream-colored sheer curtain partially drawn back on the right side of the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the right side of the window in Image B, a translucent, cream-colored curtain is visible. It appears to be made of a lightweight, sheer fabric, allowing light to pass through while still providing some privacy. The curtain is pulled back slightly, revealing more of the window frame and the outdoor view. This is a common interior design choice to allow natural light while maintaining aesthetic appeal. The color and texture match the description of a cream-colored sheer curtain.",

      "question": "Is the cat’s tail thick, fluffy, and curled around its body in a relaxed manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat’s tail in Image B is visibly thick and covered in long, dense fur, characteristic of a fluffy tail. It is curled loosely around the base of the cat’s body, resting on the floor in a relaxed position. The curvature and volume of the tail suggest comfort and calmness, typical of a contented cat. This posture is consistent with how long-haired breeds like Persian or Maine Coon cats often rest when relaxed. The tail does not appear tense or stiff, supporting the interpretation of relaxation.",

      "question": "Is the cat sitting on a dark brown wooden floor with visible planks and natural wood grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface beneath the cat in Image B shows distinct wooden planks running horizontally. The color is a deep, dark brown, and the natural grain patterns are clearly visible, including variations in tone and texture that indicate real wood. The reflections and lighting further emphasize the material’s authenticity. This type of flooring is common in residential interiors, especially in rooms with classic or traditional decor. The visual details confirm the presence of a dark brown wooden floor with visible grain.",

      "question": "Do the cat’s eyes appear large, round, and golden-brown with clear reflections indicating light source from the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat’s eyes in Image B are indeed large and round, typical of many domestic cats, especially those with expressive faces. Their color is a warm golden-brown, which is common in orange tabby cats. Upon close inspection, there are distinct highlights or reflections in the pupils, located toward the right side of each eye, suggesting that the primary light source is coming from the right. This is consistent with the ambient lighting in the scene, where sunlight appears to enter from the right through the window. The reflection pattern supports the inference about the direction of illumination.",
