      "question": "Is the cake round in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake appears to have a cylindrical form with a flat top and bottom, which is characteristic of a round cake. Although the artistic style is highly stylized with bold outlines and halftone patterns typical of pop art, the overall silhouette of the cake maintains a circular cross-section. The frosting and decorations are symmetrically arranged around the cake's perimeter, reinforcing the impression of a round shape. This conclusion is consistent with common knowledge about birthday cakes, which are typically round or oval, and the visual cues here align with that expectation.",

      "question": "Is there exactly one candle on top of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a single yellow candle with a flame visible on top of the cake. Despite the exaggerated and stylized nature of the image, only one candle is present. The flame is depicted as a bright orange-yellow shape rising from the candle, and no other candles are visible on the cake. This matches the typical setup for a first birthday or a symbolic celebration where a single candle is used. The visual clarity of the candle and its singular placement supports this conclusion.",

      "question": "Is the cake placed on a raised stand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is positioned on a pedestal-like object that elevates it above the surface of the table. This stand has a base, a stem, and a circular platform, which is consistent with a traditional cake stand. The design includes decorative elements such as red floral motifs, and the cake sits securely on the platform. The elevation is clearly visible, separating the cake from the tabletop. This aligns with common practices in celebrations where cakes are displayed on stands for visibility and presentation.",

      "question": "Is there a vase with coral-pink fluffy flowers on the left side of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the left side of the cake, there is a vase containing flowers that are coral-pink in color and have a fluffy, textured appearance. The vase itself is blue with dark shading, and the flowers resemble chrysanthemums or similar blooms commonly associated with East Asian aesthetics. The visual details, including the soft texture and vibrant color, match the description of 'coral-pink fluffy flowers.' The positioning relative to the cake confirms it is on the left side. This observation is supported by both visual evidence and cultural context, where such floral arrangements are often used in festive settings.",

      "question": "Are there multiple colored balloons floating above the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several balloons of different colors—red, green, blue, yellow, and white—are visible floating above the cake. These balloons are attached to strings and appear to be ascending, contributing to the celebratory atmosphere. The use of multiple colors and their arrangement above the cake suggest a festive occasion. The pop-art style emphasizes these elements with bold outlines and halftone patterns, but the presence of multiple colored balloons is unmistakable. This aligns with common party traditions where colorful balloons are used for decoration.",

      "question": "Are there small floral decorations (one purple and one green) on top of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the cake features two small decorative elements: one appears to be purple, and the other green. These are positioned near the candle and are distinct from the frosting. Their shapes resemble small flowers or buds, consistent with typical cake decorations. While the style is stylized, the contrast in color and form makes them identifiable as separate decorative elements. This matches common cake decorating practices where small edible flowers or fondant pieces are added for aesthetic appeal.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the table surface, there are two pairs of chopsticks and several small bowls containing red spherical objects that resemble candies. The chopsticks are placed horizontally near the bottom edge of the frame, and the bowls are scattered across the table. The red candies are uniformly shaped and sized, suggesting they are decorative or edible treats. The presence of chopsticks indicates an East Asian cultural context, which is reinforced by the background architecture and floral arrangements. This combination of items is consistent with a festive meal setting in such a culture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features architectural elements such as curved roofs, tiled eaves, and ornate wooden structures that are characteristic of traditional East Asian buildings, particularly those found in Chinese or Japanese temples or palaces. The roofline, with its upward-curving edges and layered tiles, is a key indicator. Additionally, red lanterns and decorative banners are visible, further supporting the cultural context. The stylized rendering does not obscure these defining features, and the overall composition aligns with known examples of East Asian architecture.",
