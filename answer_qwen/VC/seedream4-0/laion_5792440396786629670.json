      "question": "Is there a central root node labeled or represented as \"HOMEPAGE\" positioned at the top center of the diagram?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual layout clearly shows a central node at the top center of the diagram labeled 'HOMEPAGE'. This node is visually distinct and serves as the starting point of the site architecture, with paths branching out from it. The label 'HOMEPAGE' is prominently displayed in a white box with a star icon nearby, indicating its significance as the root of the structure. The positioning and labeling align with standard site map conventions where the homepage is the primary entry point. Based on this visual evidence and common web design practices, we can conclude that the HOMEPAGE is indeed centrally located and labeled.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly five primary branches originating from the HOMEPAGE node, corresponding to PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS, ABOUT US, EVENTS & RESOURCES, SUCCESS STORIES, and CONTACT US?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, five main branches extend from the HOMEPAGE node. Each branch leads to a distinct section: 'PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS', 'ABOUT US', 'EVENTS & RESOURCES', 'SUCCESS STORIES', and 'CONTACT US'. These are clearly labeled and positioned symmetrically around the central HOMEPAGE node. The pathways are illustrated as winding roads leading to each section, reinforcing their role as primary navigation points. This matches the typical hierarchical structure of a website sitemap, where these sections represent the top-level navigation. The presence of exactly five such branches confirms the answer.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a legend labeled \"SITE MAP KEY\" located in the bottom-right corner of the image, showing color codes for different levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom-right corner contains a rectangular box labeled 'SITE MAP KEY'. Inside this box, there are color-coded entries corresponding to different levels of the site hierarchy: HOMEPAGE (white), 1st Level (orange), 2nd Level (brown), 3rd Level (teal), 4th Level (red), and Future (light blue). This legend provides a visual guide to interpret the color coding used throughout the map. Its placement and content match standard documentation practices for site maps, making it easy for viewers to understand the structure. Thus, the presence of this legend is confirmed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-left corner features a logo consisting of the text 'to the web' with a yellow circular dot preceding 'to'. This matches the branding style seen in other materials from ToTheWeb LLC. The logo is stylistically consistent with the company's identity and is placed in a prominent position, typically reserved for branding in professional documents. The presence of this logo confirms the source and ownership of the document, which is standard practice in corporate materials.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the main content area, there is a section labeled 'FOOTER'. Within this section, two nodes are clearly visible: 'Privacy Policy' and 'Site Map'. These are connected by lines to the footer, indicating they are part of the footer content. The layout follows common web design patterns where legal and navigational links are grouped in the footer. The visual representation aligns with standard site architecture diagrams, confirming the presence of these elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, under the 'SUCCESS STORIES' branch, there are three distinct nodes labeled 'Case Study #1', 'Case Study #2', and 'Case Study #3'. These are arranged vertically and connected by paths to the parent node. The labels are clearly readable, and the number of nodes matches the expected count for case studies in a typical site structure. The visual grouping and labeling confirm that exactly three case study nodes exist under this section.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, under the 'Products' section, there are three product nodes: 'Product #1', 'Product #2', and 'Product #3'. Directly beneath 'Product #3', there is a node labeled 'Product Details'. This node is connected by a path, indicating it is a sub-page or detail page related to Product #3. The placement and labeling follow logical information architecture principles, where detailed pages are nested under specific product entries. The visual connection and label confirm its existence.",
