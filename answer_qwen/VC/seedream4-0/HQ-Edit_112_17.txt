    "Question": "Q1: Does the hammer retain its claw-shaped end and dual-headed structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer is clearly visible with a distinct claw-shaped end on one side and a flat striking surface on the other, which is characteristic of a standard claw hammer. The dual-headed structure is preserved, with one side being the hammer head for driving nails and the other being the claw for pulling them out. This design is consistent with typical hammers used in carpentry or general repair work. The visual cues confirm that both functional ends are present and correctly shaped. No deformation or omission is observed. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and common knowledge of hammer design, the hammer retains its intended structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the chisel retain its flat, rectangular blade with a beveled edge?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chisel is positioned near the center-left of the frame. Its blade appears flat and rectangular, consistent with traditional chisel designs. The edge of the blade shows a clear bevel, which is essential for cutting wood effectively. While the material appears to be polished or ceramic-like rather than metal, the shape and proportions align with those of a standard chisel. The beveled edge is necessary for precision carving and shaping, and this feature is visibly maintained. Thus, despite possible material differences, the chisel retains its core structural characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the file retain its long, straight, narrow shape?",
    "explanation": "The file in Image B is located between the chisel and the hammer. It exhibits a long, straight, and narrow form, typical of a hand file used for smoothing or shaping metal or wood. The surface appears textured, suggesting it has teeth for filing, though the texture is less detailed due to the image’s stylized nature. However, its overall geometry — elongated and slender — matches the expected shape of a file. There are no signs of curvature or irregularity that would deviate from the standard form. Hence, based on visual inspection and general tool knowledge, the file maintains its correct shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the tools positioned in the same relative arrangement as in the original image (e.g., hammer diagonal, chisel crossing file)?",
    "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the relative positions of the tools appear largely preserved. In both images, the hammer is placed diagonally across the frame, dominating the composition. The chisel lies beneath the hammer, intersecting the file at an angle. The file runs parallel to the chisel but slightly offset. The wrench-like tool is positioned to the left of the chisel in both images. The overall layout — including the diagonal orientation of the hammer and the crossing of the chisel over the file — is consistent between the two images. Although the materials and colors differ, the spatial relationships among the tools remain unchanged. This suggests a deliberate preservation of composition despite stylistic editing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the shavings retain their curled, ribbon-like shape and approximate distribution around the tools?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shavings are scattered around the tools, particularly near the hammer and chisel, mimicking the appearance of wood shavings created during carving. They maintain a curled, ribbon-like form, similar to what one might expect from using a chisel on wood. Their distribution is concentrated near the working areas of the tools, such as the chisel and hammer, which aligns with realistic usage patterns. While the coloration appears more varied (with white and orange hues), possibly indicating a different material like plastic or decorative elements, the shape and placement are consistent with the original intent. Therefore, the shavings preserve their essential form and spatial relationship to the tools.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there exactly five tools present in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we can identify the following tools: a hammer, a chisel, a file, a pair of pliers or a pry tool (with two prongs), and a wrench-like tool. These five distinct implements are arranged on the surface. Each has a unique shape and function, and none appear duplicated. The hammer is the largest object, followed by the chisel, file, and two smaller tools (the wrench and the pronged tool). Counting these objects confirms the presence of five tools. There are no additional tools hidden or obscured. Thus, based on visual enumeration and tool identification, the total number of tools is five.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the wrench-like tool retain its open-ended jaw and metal shaft shape?",
    "explanation": "The wrench-like tool in Image B is located on the right side of the frame. It features an open-ended jaw at one end, designed to fit over a nut or bolt, and a long, slender shaft extending from it. This matches the typical design of an adjustable or fixed wrench. The shape is clearly defined, with a loop at the opposite end for grip. Despite the stylized, possibly ceramic or painted finish, the structural elements — the open jaw and linear shaft — are intact. There is no distortion or missing component. Therefore, the tool retains its fundamental shape and functional morphology.",
    "answer": "Yes"
