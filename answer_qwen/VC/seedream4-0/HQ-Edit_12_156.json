      "question": "Does the structure retain four distinct legs forming a wide base that converge upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower retains a structural form reminiscent of the Eiffel Tower, with four legs at its base. These legs are clearly visible and extend upward, converging toward the center as they rise. Although the legs are wrapped in vines and flowers, their original architectural configuration is preserved. The visual cues—such as the symmetry, the triangular support framework, and the convergence point near the top—confirm that the four-legged design remains intact. This aligns with the real-world design of the Eiffel Tower, which features four arched legs that meet at a central column. Despite the fantastical elements, the foundational geometry is maintained.",

      "question": "Is the tower’s shape vertically tapered, narrowing progressively from base to spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tower in Image B displays a clear vertical tapering effect. Starting from the broad base formed by the four legs, the structure narrows progressively as it ascends. This tapering is consistent with the architectural design of the Eiffel Tower, where each level becomes smaller than the one below it. In this image, even though the tower is adorned with glowing flowers and vines, the overall silhouette remains slender and conical, culminating in a pointed spire topped with a glowing crystal. The visual gradient from wide base to narrow tip confirms the tapering shape.",

      "question": "Are there three distinct horizontal levels or platforms visible along the tower’s height?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, three distinct horizontal levels can be identified along the tower's height. These levels are marked by changes in the structure's width and the presence of decorative platforms or balconies. The first level is near the base, where the legs begin to converge. The second level appears midway up, where the vines and flowers cluster more densely, suggesting a platform-like structure. The third level is closer to the top, just below the glowing crystal spire. While these levels are not as explicitly defined as in the real Eiffel Tower due to the fantastical embellishments, the structural breaks and visual segmentation confirm the presence of three main tiers.",

      "question": "Is the tower centrally positioned in the image, aligned with the center of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tower in Image B is precisely centered within the frame. Its vertical axis aligns with the central point of the image, both horizontally and vertically. The composition uses symmetry, with the surrounding environment—such as the stone platform, trees, and cityscape—arranged symmetrically around the tower. This central alignment draws the viewer’s focus directly to the tower, emphasizing its importance. The reflection on the platform and the radial pattern of the ground further reinforce the central positioning. This compositional choice is common in artistic renderings to highlight a focal subject.",

      "question": "Is there a straight, symmetrical pathway extending from the foreground directly toward the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible straight, symmetrical pathway leading directly to the base of the tower. Instead, the foreground consists of a circular stone platform with intricate carvings and steps leading up to the tower’s base. The path is not linear but rather forms a semi-circular or radial layout around the tower. There is no long, straight walkway extending from the bottom of the frame toward the tower. This differs from typical depictions of the Eiffel Tower, where a straight avenue often leads to its base. Here, the emphasis is on the circular platform and the mystical atmosphere rather than a direct approach.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the light source (sun or equivalent) located directly behind the base of the tower, creating a halo effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary light source is not located behind the base of the tower. Instead, the light emanates from the top of the tower itself, particularly from the glowing crystal at the spire and the illuminated flowers along the structure. Additionally, the sky features a dramatic celestial scene with a starry night and nebulae, suggesting that the ambient lighting comes from above and around, rather than from a single source behind the base. There is no visible sun or halo effect behind the tower’s base. The illumination is more internal and magical, originating from the tower rather than an external light source.",

      "question": "Is there a visible cityscape in the background, extending horizontally behind the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, there is a visible cityscape in the background of Image B. It extends horizontally behind the tower, with silhouettes of tall buildings and skyscrapers visible on the horizon. The skyline includes modern structures, suggesting a futuristic or alternate version of a city. This cityscape is partially obscured by the glow of the tower and the colorful sky, but it is clearly present and spans across the background. The presence of such a cityscape adds depth and context to the scene, contrasting the fantastical tower with a recognizable urban environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tower in Image B is indeed significantly taller than all other structures in the image. It rises prominently above the surrounding landscape, including the distant cityscape and nearby trees. Its height is emphasized by the perspective, with the tower stretching from the foreground into the sky, towering over the skyline. Even though the city has tall buildings, none reach the height of the tower, which dominates the vertical space. This dominance is further accentuated by the placement of the tower in the center and the upward gaze it invites from the viewer.",
