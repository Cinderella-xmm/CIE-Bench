      "question": "Is the vessel positioned in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vessel (a genie lamp) is visually centered both horizontally and vertically within the frame. The composition draws attention directly to the lamp, with symmetrical elements such as the surrounding jewelry and the patterned fabric radiating outward from it. The lighting also emphasizes the central placement, with a soft glow emanating from behind the lamp, further reinforcing its central role in the image. Based on visual balance and compositional symmetry, the vessel appears to be intentionally placed at the center.",

      "question": "Is there a circular tray directly beneath the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vessel (the genie lamp) rests directly on a flat surface without any visible circular tray underneath it. The base of the lamp is integrated into its structure, and there is no separate tray or platform supporting it. This contrasts with typical depictions of lamps that might rest on stands, but here the lamp's base is self-supporting. Therefore, there is no evidence of a tray beneath the vessel.",

      "question": "Does vapor or smoke originate from the top opening of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, in Image B, a distinct plume of vapor or smoke rises from the top opening of the genie lamp. The smoke forms the shape of a humanoid figure, which is consistent with the mythological concept of a genie emerging from a lamp. This visual cue is central to the narrative of the image and aligns with common cultural representations of magical lamps. The origin point of the smoke is clearly the narrow opening at the top of the lampâ€™s neck.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the vessel have a conical or upward-tapering shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vessel in Image B has a broad, bulbous body that tapers upward toward the neck, forming a shape that is more rounded and curved than strictly conical. While it does narrow toward the top, the overall silhouette is not a true cone but rather an elongated, ornate teardrop or pear shape. Thus, although it tapers upward, it does not have a conical geometry. The term 'upward-tapering' may apply loosely, but 'conical' is inaccurate due to the curvature and ornamentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the vessel placed on a flat, patterned fabric surface that covers the visible ground plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the vessel in Image B is resting on a richly patterned fabric that extends across the entire visible ground plane. The fabric features intricate geometric designs in red, green, gold, and other colors, typical of Middle Eastern or Moroccan textiles. It appears flat and evenly laid out, serving as a decorative backdrop for the lamp and surrounding jewelry. There are no signs of uneven terrain or additional objects beneath the fabric, confirming it covers the visible surface.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small opening at the top of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the vessel in Image B has a small, circular opening at the top of its neck. This opening is clearly visible and serves as the source of the rising smoke. In traditional depictions of magic lamps, this small aperture is essential for the emergence of the genie. The size and position of the opening are consistent with the design of classic genie lamps, reinforcing its functional and symbolic role.",

      "question": "Is the tray made of a material visually similar to the vessel (e.g., terracotta)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This question is based on a false premise because, as established in Q2, there is no tray beneath the vessel in Image B. Since no tray exists, the comparison of materials (such as terracotta) is irrelevant. The vessel itself is made of a golden, gem-encrusted material, far removed from terracotta. Therefore, the absence of a tray makes the question about material similarity moot.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the fabric in Image B displays a highly structured geometric pattern. The design consists of repeating shapes such as diamonds, zigzags, and interlocking lines, arranged in a symmetrical and orderly fashion. These patterns are characteristic of traditional Middle Eastern or North African textiles. The use of bold colors and precise repetition indicates a deliberate and organized design, confirming the presence of a structured geometric motif.",
