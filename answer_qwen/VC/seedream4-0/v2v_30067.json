      "question": "Is the clock face present with Roman numerals I through XII arranged in a circle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is clearly visible and features Roman numerals. The numerals are arranged in a circular pattern, starting from I at the top right and progressing clockwise to XII at the top. This is consistent with standard clock design where Roman numerals I through XII are used to denote hours. The presence of these numerals in a circular arrangement confirms that the clock face is correctly formatted. No missing or misaligned numerals are observed, and the layout matches typical analog clock conventions.",

      "question": "Is the clock face located directly above the central arched opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is positioned on the upper section of the tower, immediately above a large, central arched opening. The arch is visibly damaged but still discernible, and it is located directly beneath the clock. The alignment between the clock and the arch suggests intentional architectural placement, common in historical clock towers where the clock is placed above a decorative or structural archway. This positioning is consistent with traditional clock tower designs, reinforcing the conclusion that the clock face is indeed located directly above the central arched opening.",

      "question": "Does the top of the tower feature a pointed gable with finials at each corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the tower in Image B shows a pointed, triangular gable structure, characteristic of Gothic or neo-Gothic architectural styles. At each of the four corners of this gable, there are small, vertical projections that resemble finials—decorative elements often found on spires or gables. These finials appear weathered but are distinguishable as distinct architectural features. Given the visual evidence and architectural conventions, the presence of both a pointed gable and corner finials supports the conclusion that the tower's top includes these elements.",

      "question": "Are there two arched windows on the left and right sides of the tower, positioned symmetrically below the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, there are two arched openings on the left and right sides of the tower. These openings are located vertically below the clock face and appear to be symmetrical in shape and placement relative to the central axis of the tower. While the stone around them is cracked and eroded, their form and position suggest they were originally designed as windows or decorative arches. Their symmetry and alignment with the clock face support the idea that they are intended to balance the tower’s façade. This is consistent with classical architectural symmetry seen in many historic towers.",

      "question": "Is the undamaged stone surface of the tower uniformly light gray with visible cracks and rough texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stone surface of the tower in Image B appears to be predominantly light gray, which is typical for aged limestone or sandstone structures. However, the surface is not uniformly intact—there are numerous visible cracks and areas of erosion, especially around the arches and edges. The texture is rough and uneven, indicating weathering over time. While the color is generally consistent, the 'undamaged' portions are limited due to extensive cracking. Thus, while the material has a uniform light gray tone, the overall surface is not uniformly intact or smooth. The description emphasizes 'undamaged' areas, but such areas are minimal and still show signs of wear. Therefore, the statement about uniformity and condition is misleading.",

      "question": "Is there an intact arched opening directly above the clock face, forming a decorative frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no intact arched opening directly above the clock face. Instead, the area above the clock is occupied by the pointed gable and finials, with no visible arch framing the clock from above. The clock is embedded within a rectangular recessed frame, but there is no separate arched structure above it. In contrast, some historical towers do have decorative arches above clocks, but this one does not. The absence of such an arch is evident from the clear line of the gable directly above the clock, without any intervening archway.",

      "question": "Does the tower maintain a tall, narrow vertical profile with distinct horizontal divisions at the base, middle, and top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a tall, narrow structure that rises vertically, consistent with a clock tower. There are clear horizontal divisions: one near the base (where the lower arch begins), another at mid-height (separating the clock level from the lower section), and a third at the top (under the gable). These divisions are marked by changes in stonework, moldings, and architectural details, suggesting intentional segmentation. The overall silhouette is slender and elongated, typical of clock towers. The presence of these three distinct horizontal levels supports the conclusion that the tower maintains a structured vertical profile with defined divisions.",
