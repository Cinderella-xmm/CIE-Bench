      "question": "Is the trunk of each elephant still curved upward in the same manner as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both elephants have trunks that are curved upward and curled inward at the tip, similar to the posture seen in Image A. The curvature appears consistent with the original design—both trunks follow a smooth arc from the snout up and then curl back toward the face. This is a common artistic representation of elephants in decorative items, symbolizing good fortune. Visually comparing the trunk shape between the two images, the upward curve and spiral end are preserved. Therefore, despite the transformation into perfume bottles, the trunk's pose remains faithful to the original.",

      "question": "Are the ears of both elephants still present in their original flared shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ears of both elephants are clearly visible and maintain a large, flared shape, consistent with the original design seen in Image A. The ears are positioned on the sides of the head and extend outward in a broad, rounded form. In both images, the ears are depicted as prominent features, contributing to the ornamental aesthetic. Although the material and surface texture differ (mosaic tiles in Image B vs. solid finish in Image A), the shape and placement remain unchanged. This suggests that the designer preserved the iconic ear structure for visual continuity.",

      "question": "Is the oval-shaped mosaic pattern located on the back of each elephant, centered and bordered by gold trim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backs of the elephants feature a mosaic-like design composed of small blue and white tiles arranged in a flowing, curved pattern. However, this is not an oval-shaped mosaic; instead, it follows the contour of the bottle’s body and does not form a distinct oval shape. Additionally, while there is gold trim around the neck and base, the back area lacks a clear gold border surrounding a central mosaic oval. In contrast, Image A shows a clearly defined oval mosaic pattern on the back, bordered by gold trim. Thus, the pattern in Image B is stylized differently and does not match the original oval design.",

      "question": "Do both elephants retain golden-colored tusks positioned near the mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both elephant heads display small, pointed tusks that are golden in color and positioned near the mouth, just below the trunk. These tusks are consistent with the appearance in Image A, where similarly colored and placed tusks are present. Despite the change in material and overall form (from solid figurines to glass bottles), the tusks remain a key feature and are preserved in both size, color, and location. This indicates intentional design continuity.",

      "question": "Is there a decorative band with scrollwork pattern around the lower body of each elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower portion of each elephant’s body is encircled by a thin, golden band that features intricate scrollwork or filigree patterns. This detail matches the decorative bands seen in Image A, which also include ornate designs around the base of the figurines. While the materials differ (metallic gold in Image A vs. gold trim on glass in Image B), the presence and style of the scrollwork band are preserved. This suggests a deliberate effort to maintain aesthetic consistency across the design evolution.",

      "question": "Are the eyes of both elephants positioned on the sides of the head and colored dark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both elephants have dark-colored eyes located on the sides of their heads, consistent with natural elephant anatomy and the original depiction in Image A. The eyes are small, round, and set deeply into the head, maintaining their position and coloration. Even though the surfaces are now made of reflective mosaic tiles and glass, the eye details are clearly rendered in dark tones and placed correctly. This preservation ensures the elephants retain a lifelike and balanced facial expression.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both elephants appear to be identical in size and shape, standing side by side with no discernible difference in scale. This contrasts with Image A, where one elephant is noticeably larger than the other, suggesting a parent-and-offspring relationship. In Image B, the two figures are symmetrical and mirror each other, indicating that the original size hierarchy has been eliminated. Therefore, the relative size relationship between the elephants has changed.",
