      "question": "Are the stone steps beneath the character present and textured with visible cracks and moss-like details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is seated on a wooden rocking chair placed on a patterned rug over a wooden floor. There are no stone steps visible beneath her. The flooring consists of polished wood planks, and the texture is smooth without any cracks or moss-like details. This contrasts with typical representations of aged stone steps, which would show wear, uneven surfaces, and organic growth like moss. Therefore, based on visual evidence, the stone steps with such textures are not present.",

      "question": "Is there an arched window with vertical iron bars visible in the background behind the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features an interior setting with warm lighting from candles and a lit oil lamp. There is an arched doorway or alcove to the right, but it lacks iron bars. Instead, the area appears to be covered with ivy and has a stone wall structure. No vertical iron bars are visible in any window or archway. In contrast, Image A shows a dark, outdoor scene with an arched window that does have vertical iron bars. Thus, this feature is absent in Image B.",

      "question": "Are dark, twisting vines with dried leaves covering the walls and archways around the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment includes green ivy climbing up the stone wall on the right side of the frame. However, these vines are fresh and leafy, not dried or twisted in a dark, ominous manner. The overall atmosphere is cozy and warmly lit, suggesting a maintained indoor or semi-outdoor space rather than a neglected, gothic ruin. While vines are present, they lack the dried, twisting appearance seen in Image A, where the vines are darker and more decayed. Therefore, the specific type of vine described is not accurate for Image B.",

      "question": "Are multiple small, round, multicolored candies scattered on the stone steps near the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no stone steps visible, nor are there any candies scattered on the floor. Instead, the character sits on a wooden rocking chair on a rug, and nearby objects include a sewing kit, a porcelain figurine, and an oil lamp. The only colorful items are the spool of thread in the box and the figurine’s attire, but no multicolored candies are present. In Image A, candies are clearly visible on stone steps, but this detail is absent in Image B. Hence, the presence of such candies is not confirmed.",

      "question": "Is the character sitting cross-legged on the steps with her hands near her chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is seated in a wooden rocking chair, not on steps. Her legs are positioned straight down with feet flat on the floor, not crossed. Her hands are holding the edges of her hat, raised slightly above her chest level. This posture differs significantly from the cross-legged position seen in Image A, where she sits directly on steps with hands near her chest. Thus, the pose described does not match the current image.",

      "question": "Is the object replacement consistent with original placement: sewing kit and porcelain figurine on the left, oil lamp on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition places the sewing kit (a wooden box with thread) and a porcelain figurine of a woman to the left of the rocking chair. On the right side, an oil lamp is positioned on the floor, emitting light. This arrangement mirrors the spatial logic of placing key props symmetrically around the central figure. Comparing to Image A, where a basket of candy and a cat were on the left and a pumpkin on the right, the new objects are placed in analogous positions—left and right relative to the character. Therefore, while the objects have changed, their placement follows the same directional consistency.",

      "question": "Does the oil lamp emit a warm, golden glow that illuminates the surrounding area, similar to the original pumpkin’s light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the oil lamp on the right side is lit and emits a soft, warm, golden glow. This light casts gentle highlights on the nearby rug, the base of the rocking chair, and the figurine, creating a cozy ambiance. The quality of the light is comparable to the glowing effect of the carved pumpkin in Image A, which also provided a warm illumination in a dark setting. Both light sources serve as focal points and contribute to a festive, atmospheric mood. Thus, the oil lamp's glow is functionally and visually similar to the pumpkin’s light in terms of warmth and impact.",
