      "question": "Is there a white blaze running down the center of the horse's face from the forehead to the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is a plush toy with a stylized, cartoonish design. The facial features are simplified, and while there is a light-colored area on the face, it does not form a continuous white blaze running from the forehead to the muzzle. Instead, the coloration appears more as a soft, rounded patch around the nose and mouth, typical of plush toy design rather than realistic equine markings. Therefore, based on visual analysis and common knowledge of plush toy aesthetics, there is no distinct white blaze as seen in real horses.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the horse have a large white patch on its left side, extending from the shoulder toward the flank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a plush horse with a prominent white patch on its torso. However, this patch is centrally located on the chest and belly area and does not extend along the left side from the shoulder toward the flank. In contrast, the white marking is more circular or oval-shaped and is positioned lower on the body. Based on the visual layout and typical plush toy design conventions, the white patch does not follow the described anatomical path. Thus, the answer is no.",

      "question": "Is the horse facing slightly to the left of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush horse is seated and oriented directly forward, facing the viewer. Its eyes are centered and symmetrical, and its body is aligned perpendicular to the front of the box. There is no indication of a sideways turn or tilt. The positioning suggests a frontal pose, consistent with display-style plush toys designed for balanced presentation. Therefore, the horse is not facing slightly to the left.",

      "question": "Are there multiple dandelion seed heads visible in the foreground, surrounding the horse’s legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush horse is sitting on a green felt base that simulates grass. Several small, crafted dandelion seed heads are placed in front of and around the horse's feet. These are clearly visible and appear to be part of the diorama setup. Although they are not natural plants, they are intentionally positioned to resemble dandelions in the foreground. Thus, multiple dandelion seed heads are indeed present and surround the horse’s legs.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a forest of tall coniferous trees visible in the background behind the horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a backdrop within a framed box that depicts a forest scene. The background includes illustrated tree trunks and foliage, resembling a woodland environment. While the trees are not actual coniferous trees but rather artistic representations, they are styled to look like tall, slender trees typical of a forest setting. Given that the image is a crafted diorama, the background is meant to simulate a forest, including conifer-like elements. Therefore, based on the visual cues and interpretation of artistic representation, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Is the sunlight coming from the left side of the image, casting a golden glow on the horse’s mane and left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is an indoor photograph of a plush toy displayed in a box. There is no natural lighting source such as sunlight visible in the image. The lighting appears even and artificial, likely from a studio setup, with no directional glow or golden highlights. The mane and body are uniformly lit without any shadows or warm tones indicating sunlight from the left. Therefore, there is no sunlight coming from the left side.",

      "question": "Is the horse standing directly within the field of dandelions, with flower stalks reaching up to its legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is seated on a flat, green felt surface inside a box. The dandelions are small, handcrafted elements placed in front of the horse, not growing naturally in a field. The flower stalks do not reach up to the horse’s legs; instead, they are short and positioned at ground level. The scene is a diorama, not a natural landscape. Thus, the horse is not standing in a field of dandelions with stalks reaching its legs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush horse has two ears that are upright and angled slightly forward, which is typical for a friendly, alert expression in stuffed animals. The ears are symmetrically placed and point forward, consistent with the stylized design of many plush toys. This positioning is intentional for aesthetic appeal and to convey a cheerful demeanor. Therefore, both ears are upright and pointing forward.",
