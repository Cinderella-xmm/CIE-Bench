      "question": "Does the edited image retain the dynamic posture of the subject, showing a forward-leaning stance with bent knees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted riding a wave on a surfboard. The posture shows a forward-leaning stance with bent knees, which is characteristic of proper surfing technique. This body position helps maintain balance and control while navigating the wave. The visual cues—such as the angle of the torso, the bend in the knees, and the positioning of the feet on the board—are consistent with dynamic motion during surfing. Based on world knowledge, this posture is essential for stability and maneuverability in surfing, especially when riding a breaking wave. Therefore, the dynamic posture is accurately represented.",

      "question": "Does the edited image show the subject's hands interacting with the surfboard in a manner consistent with surfing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is holding a ski pole in one hand while surfing. This is inconsistent with typical surfing behavior, where surfers do not use poles. In fact, using a ski pole while surfing is physically impractical and would interfere with balance and movement. Surfing typically involves using arms for balance and direction, but not holding any external equipment like poles. The presence of the ski pole suggests an edit that has merged elements from skiing into the surfing scene, making the interaction unnatural. Therefore, the hand interaction is not consistent with real surfing.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the skier's attire in some form, such as a wetsuit or beach-appropriate clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is wearing swim shorts and is shirtless, which is appropriate attire for a tropical beach setting and surfing. However, there is no indication of the original skier’s attire (such as a red jacket, helmet, or ski pants) being retained. Instead, the clothing has been changed to something suitable for warm weather and water sports. While the attire is beach-appropriate, it does not reflect any retention of the skier’s original outfit. Therefore, the skier’s attire has not been preserved in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the edited image include some form of protective gear on the subject, such as a helmet or goggles adapted for surfing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is not wearing any protective gear such as a helmet or goggles. These items are commonly used in skiing for safety but are not standard or practical for surfing. While some surfers may wear helmets in certain conditions (e.g., big wave surfing), they are not typically seen in recreational surfing, especially in a tropical setting like this. The absence of such gear is consistent with typical surfing practices. However, since the question asks whether protective gear adapted for surfing is present, and none is visible, the answer is negative.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a bright blue sky, turquoise ocean waves, white foam, golden sand, and lush green palm trees. These colors collectively create a vivid and vibrant palette typical of a tropical beach environment. The contrast between the clear blue water and the green foliage enhances the sense of warmth and natural beauty associated with such locations. Based on world knowledge, these visual elements are hallmark features of tropical destinations, and their inclusion makes the color scheme highly appropriate for the setting.",
