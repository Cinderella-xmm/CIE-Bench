      "question": "Is there a handheld fan with a circular blade structure being held in the manâ€™s right hand, directed toward the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted holding a black handheld fan in his right hand. The fan has a clearly visible circular blade structure, typical of small personal fans. The orientation of the fan is such that it is pointed directly toward the cake, indicating an intention to direct airflow toward it. This aligns with the visual cues and common understanding of how such devices are used. The design and positioning suggest functionality consistent with blowing air.",

      "question": "Are there exactly seven candles on the cake, with visible flames and smoke rising from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the cake in Image B, there are seven candles placed on top. Each candle has a visible flame, indicating they are lit. However, while the flames are present, there is no visible smoke rising from the candles themselves. Smoke typically appears when wax burns or when air movement causes vaporization, but here the flames appear steady without any smoke plumes. Thus, although the number of candles matches (seven), the presence of smoke is not confirmed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the candles on the cake have flames, but there is no visible smoke emanating from them. Smoke would usually be seen as wispy trails above burning candles, especially if they are extinguished or disturbed by air. In this image, the flames are stable and upright, and no smoke is apparent. This contrasts with expectations where smoke might be expected due to wind or blowing, but none is shown here.",

      "question": "Is the man leaning forward with his mouth puckered as if blowing air toward the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is seated upright in a chair, facing forward, with a neutral facial expression. His mouth is closed and relaxed, not puckered. There is no indication of him leaning forward or making a blowing motion. This contrasts with typical birthday scenes where individuals lean in and puff their cheeks to blow out candles. Therefore, based on visual evidence, he is not in a posture suggesting blowing.",

      "question": "Is the cake placed on a white plate, which is on a wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is clearly positioned on a round white plate. This plate rests on a surface that has the texture and color of wood, consistent with a wooden table. The details of the grain and finish support the identification of a wooden surface. This setup is typical for serving cakes during celebrations and matches standard presentation practices.",

      "question": "Is the handheld fan positioned so that its airflow is directed toward the candles on the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handheld fan in Image B is held in the character's right hand and angled such that the front of the fan faces the cake. Given the orientation of the fan blades and the direction of the device, it is logically positioned to generate airflow toward the candles. This setup implies an intent to simulate blowing out the candles using mechanical force rather than breath. While no actual airflow is visible, the positioning strongly suggests that the airflow would be directed at the candles.",
