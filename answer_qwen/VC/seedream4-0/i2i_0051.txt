    "Question": "Q1: Does the image retain the gesture of both women shaking hands over the tennis net?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the two women are positioned on opposite sides of the tennis net, and their right hands are extended toward each other, meeting in the middle above the net. This gesture is consistent with a handshake, which is a common sportsmanship ritual after a match. The visual cues—such as the alignment of their arms, the proximity of their hands, and the posture of their bodies—indicate that they are indeed shaking hands. This behavior is typical in tennis and aligns with real-world expectations of post-match etiquette. Therefore, the gesture is preserved.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are both women holding tennis rackets in their hands?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both women are clearly depicted holding tennis rackets. The woman on the left has a red racket in her left hand, while the woman on the right holds a blue racket in her left hand. The rackets are positioned naturally, consistent with how players would carry them during or after a match. Their grip and the orientation of the rackets suggest active use or recent play. This matches standard tennis equipment usage, confirming that both individuals are holding rackets.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the tennis court depicted with green surfaces and white boundary lines?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a tennis court with a sandy or light brown surface rather than green. The ground appears to be clay-like in texture and color, which is characteristic of a clay court. The boundary lines are white, which is standard for tennis courts regardless of surface type. However, since the surface is not green but instead earth-toned, the description of 'green surfaces' does not apply. This contrasts with typical hard courts (which can be green) but aligns with clay courts, which are often reddish-brown. Thus, the surface is not green.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a tennis ball visible on the court near the ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small yellow object near the base of the scoreboard on the left side of the frame. This object resembles a tennis ball in shape and color. It is located close to the ground and appears to be resting on the court surface. While it may be slightly stylized due to the artistic rendering, its placement and appearance are consistent with a tennis ball. Additionally, tennis balls are commonly found near scoreboards or on the court during play. Therefore, a tennis ball is visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is there a tennis net dividing the court between the two women?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a net is clearly visible stretching across the center of the court, separating the two women. The net has a white top band and black mesh, which is standard for tennis nets. It runs horizontally across the image and is anchored at both ends by posts. The positioning of the players on either side of the net confirms its role as a divider. This structure is consistent with real-world tennis court layouts, indicating that the net is present and properly placed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
