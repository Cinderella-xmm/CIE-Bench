      "question": "Does the image retain the orange tabby fur pattern with distinctive stripe markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kitten in Image B displays a consistent orange tabby fur pattern, characterized by prominent dark orange stripes on a lighter orange base. This is typical of the classic tabby pattern, which includes M-shaped markings on the forehead and symmetrical stripes along the body. The visual cues show that these patterns are clearly visible and well-defined, indicating that the fur pattern has been preserved. There is no indication of alteration or distortion in the fur texture or coloration. Based on world knowledge, orange tabby cats commonly have such markings, and the image reflects this accurately.",

      "question": "Are the kitten's eyes still green with a clear, open expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kitten's eyes in Image B are distinctly green with a bright, alert appearance. The pupils are round and dilated slightly, suggesting a state of attentiveness. The clarity of the eyes, including visible reflections and sharp detail, indicates a healthy, open expression. Green eyes are common in kittens, especially in orange tabbies, and the image captures this trait accurately. There is no sign of cloudiness or blurring, confirming that the eyes remain clear and expressive as they would naturally be.",

      "question": "Is the kitten's pink nose and surrounding white whiskers present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kitten in Image B has a small, pink nose that is centrally located on its face, consistent with typical feline anatomy. Surrounding the nose are long, white whiskers that extend outward from the muzzle, which are clearly visible and appear natural in length and placement. These features are characteristic of young cats and are not altered in any way. The contrast between the pink nose and the white whiskers against the orange fur enhances their visibility, and there is no evidence of editing or modification to these facial features.",

      "question": "Does the kitten remain in a lying position with its paws stretched forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kitten in Image B is positioned in a relaxed lying posture, with its front paws extended forward and resting on the surface. This pose is typical for a resting or curious kitten, and the alignment of the limbs suggests a natural, undisturbed position. The paws are clearly visible and placed symmetrically, indicating that the kitten has not been repositioned or edited in terms of limb placement. This posture matches what one would expect from a calm, alert kitten observing its surroundings.",

      "question": "Is the background still softly blurred, maintaining focus on the kitten?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is out of focus, with a smooth bokeh effect that draws attention to the kitten as the primary subject. This shallow depth of field is a common photographic technique used to emphasize the foreground subject while minimizing distractions. The soft blur ensures that the viewer's attention remains on the kittenâ€™s facial features and expressions. The lighting and color gradients in the background suggest a controlled environment, likely indoors, and the lack of sharp details confirms that the focus is intentionally maintained on the kitten.",
