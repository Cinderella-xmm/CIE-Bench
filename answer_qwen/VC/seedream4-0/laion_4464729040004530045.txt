    "Question": "Q1: Is the woman in the edited image positioned in a three-quarter profile view, facing to the left?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is shown from a perspective where her body is angled slightly toward the viewer, but her face is turned more directly toward the camera. Her shoulders are not fully aligned with the camera's viewpoint, indicating a partial side view. However, she is not in a full three-quarter profile (which would show about 75% of one side of her face and body), nor is she facing directly to the left. Instead, she is angled slightly to the right, with her gaze directed forward and slightly to the left. This positioning suggests a slight turn of the body rather than a true three-quarter profile facing left. Therefore, based on visual cues and common photographic terminology, she is not in a three-quarter profile view facing left.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the woman’s head tilted downward in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s head is held upright, with her chin level or slightly raised. Her eyes are looking directly at the camera, and there is no visible tilt or droop in her head position that would suggest it is lowered. The angle of her neck and the alignment of her facial features indicate a neutral to slightly elevated head posture. There is no indication of a downward tilt, which would typically result in the chin pointing toward the chest. Based on this analysis, her head is not tilted downward.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the woman’s arms positioned at her sides in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both of the woman’s arms are visible and appear to be hanging naturally by her sides. Her hands are relaxed, with fingers slightly curled, and they rest close to her body. The positioning of her arms does not suggest any movement or raising; instead, they align vertically along her torso. This is consistent with a typical standing pose where arms are at the sides. There is no indication of her arms being crossed, raised, or bent at the elbows in a way that would deviate from a neutral side position. Thus, based on visual observation, her arms are indeed positioned at her sides.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the woman have white nail polish on her fingernails in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s fingernails are clearly visible, especially on her right hand. Her nails are painted black, not white. This can be confirmed by observing the contrast between the dark polish and the pale skin tone of her fingers. Additionally, the lighting in the image enhances the visibility of the nail color, making it distinct. Given this clear visual evidence, it is evident that her nail polish is black, not white.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the woman facing to the left in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s body is oriented such that her front is mostly visible to the camera. Her face is turned slightly toward the left, but her overall orientation is forward-facing with a minor lateral shift. While her gaze is directed slightly to the left, her shoulders and torso are not rotated significantly in that direction. In photography, 'facing to the left' implies a substantial turn of the body toward the left side of the frame. Here, the woman is primarily facing forward, with only a slight turn of the head. Therefore, she is not truly facing to the left.",
    "answer": "No"
