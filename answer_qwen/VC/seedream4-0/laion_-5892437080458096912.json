      "question": "Is the subject's face, including the almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and closed mouth with red lips, preserved in the same position and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's facial features are clearly visible. The eyes are almond-shaped, the nose is straight, and the mouth is closed with red lips, consistent with typical Renaissance portraiture style. These features appear to be positioned symmetrically on the face, with no noticeable distortion or repositioning. Comparing this to Image A, the facial structure remains identical in both images—eyes, nose, and mouth maintain their original proportions and placement. There is no evidence of digital manipulation altering the facial geometry. Thus, based on visual cues and knowledge of historical portraiture consistency, the face is preserved in the same position and form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the subject’s hair color (reddish-brown) and tightly curled, rounded hairstyle preserved exactly as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject has a voluminous, tightly curled hairstyle that is rounded and frames the head symmetrically. The hair color is distinctly reddish-brown, consistent with depictions of Tudor-era figures such as Queen Elizabeth I. This matches the hairstyle and color seen in Image A. There is no visible alteration in curl pattern, volume, or coloration between the two images. The continuity in hair styling suggests that the artist or editor preserved the original appearance without modification. Therefore, based on visual comparison and historical accuracy expectations for such portraits, the hair is preserved exactly as in the original.",

      "question": "Is the jeweled headpiece with a single dangling pendant at the center of the forehead preserved in the same location and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible jeweled headpiece or pendant at the center of the forehead. Instead, the subject’s hair appears to be styled without any adornment on the forehead. In contrast, Image A clearly shows a decorative headpiece with a central pendant hanging from the forehead. This indicates that the headpiece has been removed or edited out in Image B. Given that the presence of such an ornament is historically significant in Tudor portraiture, its absence in Image B constitutes a clear change. Thus, the headpiece is not preserved in the same location or form.",

      "question": "Is the right hand positioned on a decorative object (such as a hilt) and the left hand resting on the lap, maintaining the same relative placement and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand is placed on what appears to be a decorative object resembling a hilt or ornamental handle, likely part of a ceremonial item or weapon. The left hand is positioned lower, near the lap, in a relaxed posture. Comparing this to Image A, the positioning of both hands is nearly identical—the right hand rests on a similar object, and the left hand is placed in the same general area. The orientation and relative placement of the hands remain consistent across both images. This suggests that the hand positions were preserved during editing. Therefore, the relative placement and orientation are maintained.",

      "question": "Is the subject’s skin tone (pale with subtle rosy blush on the cheeks) preserved without significant alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s skin tone appears pale with a soft, natural rosy blush on the cheeks, which is characteristic of idealized Renaissance portraiture. This is consistent with the skin tone observed in Image A. There is no visible discoloration, over-saturation, or artificial enhancement that would suggest alteration. The lighting and shading across the face maintain the same balance, indicating that the skin tone has not been significantly changed. Based on visual analysis and common standards in historical portrait restoration, the skin tone is preserved without notable modification.",

      "question": "Is the subject facing directly forward with an upright, symmetrical posture, as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted facing directly forward, with the head centered and shoulders aligned symmetrically. The body posture is upright, and there is no tilt or asymmetry in the stance. This matches the frontal, symmetrical composition seen in Image A. The alignment of the torso, neck, and head remains consistent between both images. Such a pose is typical in formal royal portraits to convey authority and dignity. Since no deviation in posture is evident, it can be concluded that the subject maintains the same upright, symmetrical posture as in the original.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the figure (head-to-body ratio, arm length, torso width) preserved without exaggeration or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure exhibits balanced proportions: the head-to-body ratio is consistent with realistic human anatomy, the arms are proportionate in length, and the torso width is appropriate relative to the height. There is no sign of elongation, compression, or unnatural scaling. When compared to Image A, these proportions remain unchanged—there is no indication of digital stretching or resizing. Historical portraiture often emphasizes idealized but anatomically plausible forms, and both images adhere to this standard. Therefore, the proportions are preserved without exaggeration or distortion.",
