      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's snout and muzzle are prominently displayed, and a distinct white marking runs from the top of the head down through the nose and around the mouth. This marking is clearly defined with sharp contrast against the darker fur, which is typical for American Staffordshire Terriers. The lighting in the museum setting enhances this contrast, making the white marking highly visible. Based on visual cues such as color differentiation and lighting, it is evident that the white marking is not only present but also well-defined.",

      "question": "Does the dog still have a predominantly black coat with clear contrast against the white markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sculpted representation of an American Staffordshire Terrier. The sculpture features a dark, almost black coat on the majority of the head and neck, with white markings on the muzzle, chest, and a stripe down the center of the face. These white areas stand out due to the strong contrast with the dark fur. In real-life dogs, especially American Staffordshire Terriers, such a color pattern is common, and the contrast is usually striking. Since the sculpture accurately mimics this natural coloring, the depiction maintains the characteristic contrast between black and white.",

      "question": "Is the dog depicted in a relaxed yet alert posture in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a bust of a dog displayed in a glass case. While the sculpture captures facial details like the eyes and ears, it lacks the full body to assess posture fully. However, the head is held upright, and the eyes are open and forward-facing, suggesting attentiveness. In animal behavior, an upright head and focused gaze often indicate alertness. Yet, since it is a static sculpture without any indication of muscle tension or body language, it cannot be considered truly 'relaxed.' The posture appears more formal and posed rather than naturally relaxed. Therefore, while alertness is implied, relaxation is not evident.",

      "question": "Are the dog's ears positioned naturally in relation to its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ears of the dog are floppy and hang down slightly from the sides of the head, which is consistent with the natural ear structure of an American Staffordshire Terrier. These dogs typically have semi-erect or floppy ears that fold forward or downward, depending on their mood and breed standard. The positioning in the sculpture reflects this anatomical trait accurately. There is no sign of unnatural distortion or incorrect placement; the ears align properly with the skull shape and facial symmetry. Thus, based on canine anatomy and breed characteristics, the ears appear to be positioned naturally.",

      "question": "Do the dog's eyes retain their reflective quality in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the dog are sculpted with a glossy surface, and there is a visible highlight in each eye, suggesting light reflection. This reflective quality is achieved through careful craftsmanship, simulating the appearance of real eyes under lighting conditions. While these are not actual living eyes, the artist has successfully captured the illusion of reflectivity using materials like paint or resin with a polished finish. In real dogs, eye reflections are caused by the tapetum lucidum and surface moisture, but in art, similar effects can be simulated. The presence of highlights indicates intentional effort to mimic realism, so the reflective quality is preserved in a stylized manner.",
