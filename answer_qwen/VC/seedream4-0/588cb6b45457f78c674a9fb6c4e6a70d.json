      "question": "Are the eyes positioned symmetrically within the face, with a slight upward slant at the outer edges and gazing directly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are positioned centrally on the face and appear to be symmetrical in placement. The outer edges of the eyes do show a subtle upward slant, which is characteristic of an expressive or thoughtful gaze. Both eyes are directed forward, aligned with the viewer’s perspective, suggesting a direct engagement. This alignment is consistent with classical portraiture techniques where symmetry and frontal gaze convey dignity and presence. The visual cues—such as equal spacing between the eyes and parallel orientation of the irises—support the conclusion that the eyes are symmetrically placed and gazing forward.",

      "question": "Does the nose have a straight bridge and a slightly rounded tip, aligned centrally between the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the facial features in Image B, the nose appears to have a straight vertical bridge extending from the brow line to the tip. The tip of the nose is gently rounded, not sharp or angular, contributing to a balanced and natural appearance. It is centered precisely between the two eyes, maintaining symmetry with the rest of the face. This alignment is typical in idealized portraiture, where facial proportions follow classical canons such as those described by Vitruvius or Leonardo da Vinci. There is no visible deviation or asymmetry, reinforcing the impression of central alignment.",

      "question": "Are the lips thin, closed, and slightly upturned at the corners, forming a neutral yet thoughtful expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lips in Image B are relatively thin compared to broader, fuller lips often seen in other styles. They are closed, with no indication of smiling or frowning. However, the corners of the mouth are subtly raised, creating a gentle upturn that suggests contemplation rather than joy. This expression aligns with the overall serene and introspective mood of the portrait. Such a lip configuration is commonly used in artistic depictions to suggest wisdom or quiet reflection, especially in portraits of elderly or noble figures. The combination of closure and slight upturn supports the interpretation of a neutral yet thoughtful expression.",

      "question": "Is the face proportionally balanced, with equal spacing between the eyes and symmetrical distribution of facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face in Image B exhibits strong symmetry and proportional balance. The distance between the eyes is consistent with standard facial proportions—approximately one eye-width apart. The eyebrows, cheeks, and jawline are mirrored on both sides, indicating careful composition. The placement of the nose, mouth, and ears (though partially obscured) follows a harmonious layout. This balance is further emphasized by the even lighting and lack of distortion. In contrast to more exaggerated or caricatured styles, this portrait adheres to classical ideals of beauty and harmony, where symmetry reflects inner virtue and stability. Therefore, the facial proportions appear well-balanced and symmetrical.",

      "question": "Is the left ear partially visible, emerging from under the hair near the temple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is long and flows down over the shoulders, covering most of the ears. On the left side of the face (viewer's right), there is no visible ear structure emerging from the hair. The hair appears thick and layered, completely obscuring the ear area. Even though the hair is parted slightly near the temple, no part of the ear is discernible. Given that the ear is typically hidden in such hairstyles and given the angle and density of the hair, it is reasonable to conclude that the left ear is not visible. This is consistent with traditional portraiture where long hair may conceal anatomical details for aesthetic reasons.",

      "question": "Are there soft shadows along the right side of the face and under the jawline, created by directional lighting from the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears to originate from the left side of the frame (viewer’s left), casting subtle shadows on the right side of the face. These shadows are particularly noticeable along the cheekbone, the edge of the nose, and beneath the jawline. The shading enhances the three-dimensionality of the face, giving depth to the beard and contours. The softness of the shadow suggests diffused light, possibly mimicking natural daylight. This use of chiaroscuro—a technique popularized during the Renaissance—is employed here to model the facial features realistically. The absence of harsh contrasts confirms that the lighting is directional but softened, consistent with a left-side light source.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The head in Image B is positioned directly above the shoulders, aligned vertically without any noticeable tilt or rotational distortion. The neck appears straight, and the shoulders are level, supporting a balanced posture. There is no evidence of the head being turned to the side or tilted forward/backward. This upright positioning contributes to the dignified and composed demeanor of the subject. In classical portraiture, such centering emphasizes authority and stability. Comparing this to common distortions in stylized art (e.g., Dutch Masters’ dramatic angles), this image maintains a neutral, frontal orientation. Thus, the head is properly centered and stable.",
