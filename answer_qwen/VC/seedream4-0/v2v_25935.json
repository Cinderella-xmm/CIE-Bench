        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is shown from behind, facing down a narrow street that recedes into the distance. The perspective clearly indicates that the figure is moving away from the viewer. The positioning of the legs and the orientation of the body suggest forward motion along the path. This visual cue, combined with common sense about how perspective works in photography and scene composition, confirms that the figure is walking away from the viewer.",

      "question": "Does the man still hold a briefcase in his right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is holding a brown briefcase in its right hand. The hand is clearly grasping the handle of the bag, and the position of the arm and hand aligns with the typical way one would carry a briefcase. The briefcase is visible and appears to be attached to the hand via the handle. The yellow hand of the LEGO figure is curled around the handle, which is consistent with the action of holding an object. Therefore, it can be concluded that the man (or figure) is holding a briefcase in his right hand.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is wearing a blue jacket that resembles a denim jacket in color and style. However, upon closer inspection, the material appears to be smooth and plastic-like, consistent with LEGO construction. Denim fabric typically has a textured weave and visible stitching, which is absent here. Instead, the jacket is a solid blue piece with no visible texture or seams, indicating it is not made of real denim but rather a LEGO part designed to mimic a jacket. Therefore, while the appearance suggests a denim jacket, the actual material and construction indicate it is not a real denim jacket.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the street is constructed from LEGO bricks arranged in a pattern that mimics a cobblestone path. The individual gray and white circular pieces resemble cobblestones, and they are laid out in a continuous path leading into the distance. On both sides of the street, there are LEGO-built structures resembling buildings, complete with windows, doors, and architectural details. These elements are consistent with the appearance of a city street. Therefore, the street is indeed depicted with a cobblestone path and buildings on both sides.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings on both sides of the street are constructed from LEGO bricks and maintain the general shapes of traditional European-style buildings. They have rectangular forms, arched doorways, multiple windows, and facades that resemble real architecture. Although they are stylized and simplified due to being made of LEGO, their overall structure and proportions are preserved. The buildings are aligned along the street and contribute to the depth and realism of the scene. Thus, the general shapes of the buildings are intact, even if they are not realistic in detail.",
