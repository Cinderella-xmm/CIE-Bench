      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style rider (appearing in multiple panels) is consistently depicted wearing a light-colored shirt that matches the beige tone seen in the original image. This can be observed across all panels where the character appears—whether standing, riding, or interacting with the horse. The shirt has a similar collar and button design to the one worn by the woman in Image A, reinforcing its identity as a beige shirt. In chibi art style, colors are often simplified but remain faithful to the original for consistency. Based on visual cues and common artistic conventions, the shirt is clearly rendered in a beige shade.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse in Image B is consistently shown with a rich brown coat across all panels where it appears. This includes both full-body views and close-ups. The coloration matches typical depictions of bay horses, which have a reddish-brown body with a black mane and tail. Even in stylized chibi form, the horse maintains this brown hue, indicating continuity with real-world equine appearance. Comparing to Image A, the horse also has a brown coat, so the depiction in Image B preserves this attribute accurately.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is equipped with a bridle that is uniformly black in color. This is visible in several panels, particularly where the horse's head is shown in detail (e.g., top-left and bottom-left panels). The bridle includes a noseband, cheekpieces, and a bit ring—all rendered in black, consistent with standard equestrian gear. While stylized, the design remains faithful to functional bridles used in real life. In Image A, the bridle is also black, so the edit retains this detail accurately.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In multiple panels of Image B, the chibi-style rider is shown holding the reins of the horse. For example, in the top-left panel, the female rider holds the reins with both hands while making a peace sign. In the bottom-left panel, the male rider is seated on the horse and gripping the reins. These actions are consistent with how riders control horses. The reins are clearly depicted as black straps extending from the bridle to the rider’s hands. This aligns with real-world equestrian practice, where reins are essential for guiding the horse. In Image A, the woman is also holding the reins, confirming that this element was preserved in the stylized version.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features soft, warm hues such as beige, light brown, and muted greens, which are characteristic of outdoor environments like fields or paddocks. Sparkles and subtle gradients suggest open skies and natural lighting. In some panels (e.g., bottom row), there are faint outlines of trees and distant landscapes, reinforcing the outdoor context. These earthy tones are consistent with rural or farm settings commonly associated with horseback riding. In Image A, the background is similarly composed of natural elements like dirt ground and greenery, so the stylized version maintains the same environmental theme using a simplified palette.",
