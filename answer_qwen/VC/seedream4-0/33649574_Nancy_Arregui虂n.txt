    "Question": "Q1: Is the rooster’s comb present on top of its head in a prominent, upright position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster's comb is clearly visible on top of its head. It appears to be large, upright, and prominently displayed, with a fiery red coloration that stands out against the rest of the bird. The shape is exaggerated and stylized, resembling flames, which enhances its prominence. This aligns with the typical biological feature of a rooster’s comb, though here it is artistically enhanced. Based on visual cues and world knowledge about roosters, the comb is indeed present in an upright and prominent position.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the red fleshy wattles visible under the rooster’s beak?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the rooster’s beak, there are distinct red fleshy structures consistent with wattles. These are clearly visible and match the typical appearance of a rooster’s wattles—fleshy, pendulous, and bright red. Even though the image has a fantastical, artistic style, the wattles remain anatomically recognizable. Comparing this to real roosters, these features are correctly represented, albeit with a more vibrant and stylized appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the rooster’s beak clearly visible and positioned at the front of the face, with a pointed tip?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster’s beak is clearly visible, located at the front of its face. It has a sharp, pointed tip and a curved structure typical of avian beaks. Despite the fantastical elements such as glowing eyes and flame-like feathers, the beak retains its natural positioning and form. This matches real-world rooster anatomy, where the beak is central and functional for pecking. The artistic rendering does not distort this key feature.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the rooster have two legs with three forward-facing toes and one rear toe on each foot?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster has two legs, and each foot displays three forward-facing toes and one rear toe (hallux), which is characteristic of birds like roosters. The toes are clearly defined and arranged in a manner consistent with avian anatomy. Even though the feet appear slightly stylized with sharper claws and golden hues, the number and arrangement of toes are accurate. This matches biological knowledge of galliform birds, including chickens and roosters.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the rooster standing on a dark gray asphalt surface with visible debris such as leaves and small plant fragments?",
    "explanation": "The ground in Image B is dark gray and textured, consistent with asphalt. Scattered across the surface are small yellow and green fragments, resembling leaves and plant debris. These details are visible and match the appearance of a real-world paved surface with organic litter. Although the rooster itself is fantastical, the background remains realistic and unaltered from the original scene. Thus, the setting is accurately depicted as a dark gray asphalt surface with debris.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the rooster standing upright with its head raised and one foot slightly forward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster is depicted in an upright stance with its head raised high, giving it a proud and alert posture. One foot is positioned slightly ahead of the other, indicating a forward movement or balance. This pose is common in both real and stylized depictions of roosters, especially when they are displaying dominance or alertness. The posture is consistent with natural behavior and is clearly rendered in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the tail positioned at the rear of the rooster’s body and extending upward in a curved shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the rooster is located at the rear of its body and extends upward in a dramatic, curved fashion. The tail feathers are long, flowing, and resemble flames, curving outward and upward in an ornate arc. While exaggerated and stylized, the positioning and curvature are consistent with the natural tail posture of a rooster, particularly during display behaviors. The artistic enhancement does not change the fundamental placement or direction of the tail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q8: Are the neck and chest feathers arranged in overlapping layers with a golden-orange hue?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the neck and chest area of the rooster display feathers that are layered in an overlapping pattern, typical of avian plumage. These feathers exhibit a golden-orange hue, with iridescent tones and metallic sheen, suggesting a fantastical interpretation. However, the arrangement mimics the natural layering seen in real roosters, where feathers overlap to provide insulation and protection. The coloration is intensified for artistic effect, but the structural arrangement remains faithful to biological reality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
