      "question": "Are the two symmetrical f-hole shapes present on the body of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin is clearly visible inside an open case. The body of the violin features two f-holes, which are characteristic sound holes found on violins and other string instruments. These f-holes are symmetrically placed on either side of the bridge, near the center of the instrument's body. Their shape is distinctively curved, resembling a stylized 'f', and they are mirrored across the central axis of the violin. This symmetry is standard in traditional violin design to balance acoustics and aesthetics. Based on visual inspection, both f-holes are present and symmetrically aligned.",

      "question": "Is the scroll with four tuning pegs located at the top end of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scroll is the ornate, carved headstock at the top of the violin, where the tuning pegs are inserted. In Image B, the top end of the violin (the scroll) is clearly visible, and it contains four tuning pegs—two on each side—used to adjust the tension of the strings. This configuration is consistent with standard violin construction. The positioning of the scroll at the uppermost part of the instrument, opposite the tailpiece, confirms its placement at the top end. The presence of four tuning pegs further verifies that this is a fully functional violin.",

      "question": "Does the object retain the classic violin silhouette with distinct upper and lower bouts and a central waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The violin in Image B exhibits the traditional hourglass shape typical of classical violins. This includes two rounded sections—the upper bout (near the scroll) and the lower bout (near the tailpiece)—connected by a narrow central waist. This silhouette is essential for both acoustic performance and aesthetic appeal. The curves are smooth and well-defined, matching the standard form of a violin. The outline is symmetrical and proportionate, indicating adherence to classical design principles.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined bridge area located between the two f-holes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bridge is the raised piece of wood that supports the strings and transmits their vibrations to the body of the violin. In Image B, the bridge is clearly visible and positioned centrally between the two f-holes. It is upright and properly aligned, supporting the strings above the fingerboard. Its placement directly between the f-holes is consistent with standard violin anatomy, allowing optimal resonance. The bridge’s shape and position confirm its function and correct placement.",

      "question": "Is the object positioned diagonally across the support surface, with the scroll pointing toward the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin is placed within an open case that rests on a wooden pedestal. The violin is oriented such that the scroll (top end) points toward the upper right corner of the frame, while the tailpiece extends toward the lower left. This diagonal orientation is intentional, likely for aesthetic presentation. The angle is not horizontal or vertical but slanted, creating a dynamic visual composition. The direction of the scroll aligns with the upper-right quadrant, confirming the diagonal placement as described.",
