    "Question": "Q1: Are the individuals still wearing helmets and goggles with visible reflective lenses?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both individuals are clearly visible wearing helmets. The person on the left (younger individual) is wearing a black helmet with reflective blue-tinted goggles, while the person on the right (older individual) is wearing a black helmet with red-tinted reflective goggles. These features are consistent with typical snowboarding safety gear. Reflective lenses are designed to reduce glare from snow and enhance visibility in bright conditions, which aligns with the sunny environment shown. The visual cues—such as the glossy surface of the goggles reflecting light—are strong indicators of reflective lenses. Based on world knowledge, these protective accessories are standard for winter sports, especially in high-altitude or bright environments like snowy slopes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are both individuals maintaining their forward-leaning posture characteristic of snowboarding?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both individuals are positioned in a crouched, forward-leaning stance with knees bent and arms slightly outstretched for balance. This posture is typical for snowboarders navigating down a slope, as it helps maintain stability and control during descent. The body alignment suggests active movement, supported by the spray of snow around their boards. Comparing this to typical snowboarding dynamics, such a posture reflects proper technique for managing speed and terrain. There is no indication of a relaxed or upright stance that would suggest they are stationary or unbalanced. Therefore, based on visual cues and common snowboarding practices, both individuals are actively engaged in snowboarding with appropriate postures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the younger individual still wearing an orange and black jacket with teal pants?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the younger individual (on the left) is wearing a jacket that is predominantly orange with black sleeves and shoulder panels, consistent with the description. The pants are a distinct teal color, matching the original attire seen in Image A. The clothing appears unchanged in style and coloration, indicating continuity in outfit. The combination of colors and design elements (e.g., fur-lined hood, zippers) matches typical winter sportswear. There is no visual evidence of alteration in clothing, so based on the image content and world knowledge of clothing consistency in sequential scenes, the attire remains the same.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the slope still covered with textured, undisturbed snow?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the slope shows signs of disturbance due to the presence of snow being kicked up by the snowboarders' movements. Additionally, there are visible tracks and uneven textures in the snow, particularly near the boarders, indicating recent activity. While some areas of snow appear relatively smooth, the overall surface is not undisturbed. The presence of two huskies running alongside the riders also contributes to disturbances in the snow. In contrast to pristine, untouched snow, this scene depicts active use of the slope. Therefore, based on visual cues such as snow displacement and tracks, the snow is no longer undisturbed.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the sky still a clear blue color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is uniformly clear and bright blue, with no visible clouds or haze. This matches the lighting conditions observed in the scene, where shadows are sharp and sunlight is strong, indicating direct exposure to sunlight under a clear sky. The absence of cloud cover and the consistent brightness across the upper portion of the image support the conclusion that the sky remains clear blue. This is consistent with typical alpine weather conditions during daytime hours in winter, especially at high altitudes. No changes in sky color or condition are evident compared to what might be expected in a natural mountain setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
