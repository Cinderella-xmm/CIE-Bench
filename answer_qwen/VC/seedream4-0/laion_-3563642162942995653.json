      "question": "Does the edited image retain exactly six wheels arranged in three axles, with the front axle near the cab and two rear axles supporting the cargo body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vehicle is depicted as a highly stylized, crystalline sculpture made of reflective gem-like facets. Despite the artistic transformation, the overall structure of the truck remains recognizable. The wheels are clearly visible and maintain their original configuration: one pair at the front (on the front axle) and two pairs at the rear (on two separate axles), totaling six wheels. The spacing and alignment of the wheels suggest that they are arranged in three axles—front, middle, and rear—as seen in the original military-style truck design. Even though the wheels are now transparent and faceted, their positions relative to the cab and cargo body remain consistent with the original layout. This structural fidelity is preserved even in the artistic rendition, indicating that the wheel count and axle arrangement have not been altered.",

      "question": "Is the cargo body positioned directly behind the cab, maintaining the same horizontal alignment and proportional length as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cargo body is clearly situated directly behind the cab, just as in the original vehicle. The spatial relationship between the cab and the cargo section has been preserved in the artistic rendering. Although the entire vehicle is now composed of reflective, gem-like surfaces, the proportions appear consistent with the original: the cargo body extends backward from the cab without any noticeable shift in alignment or scale. The length of the cargo body relative to the cab appears unchanged, suggesting that the designer maintained the original proportions during the transformation. This alignment is critical for preserving the identity of the vehicle as a military transport truck, and it has been faithfully retained in the edited version.",

      "question": "Are there two rectangular windows visible on the side of the cargo body, located approximately one-third and two-thirds along its length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cargo body features multiple geometric facets that simulate windows. Upon close inspection, two distinct rectangular window shapes can be identified on the side of the cargo body. These are positioned roughly one-third and two-thirds along the length of the cargo section, mirroring the placement in the original vehicle. While the windows are now rendered as multifaceted crystal structures rather than glass panes, their location and shape are consistent with the original design. The use of reflective materials does not obscure their presence or position, and their placement supports the idea that the artist aimed to preserve key design elements of the original truck.",

      "question": "Is the vertical slatted grille present on the front of the vehicle, centered between the headlights and aligned with the hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the vehicle retains the characteristic grille of the original truck. The grille is composed of vertical slats made from the same crystalline material as the rest of the vehicle. It is positioned centrally between the two headlights and aligned with the hood, just as in the original. Although the material is now transparent and faceted, the structure and placement of the grille remain faithful to the original design. The symmetry and central positioning are preserved, indicating that this key feature was intentionally maintained in the artistic interpretation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a side mirror is visible on the driver’s side of the vehicle. It is mounted on the upper portion of the door and extends outward, consistent with the original design. The mirror is rendered in the same crystalline material as the rest of the truck, but its shape and placement are unmistakable. The mirror's position relative to the door and its extension into space match the original vehicle's configuration. Even though the material is different, the functional and aesthetic placement has been preserved, indicating that this detail was intentionally included in the artistic rendition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a horizontal ladder structure is visible on the lower side of the cargo body. It runs parallel to the ground and is positioned below the windows, just as in the original vehicle. The ladder is constructed from the same reflective, faceted material as the rest of the truck, but its form and placement are clearly identifiable. Its purpose and location suggest it was intended to allow access to the cargo area, and its presence in the edited image confirms that this functional feature has been preserved in the artistic transformation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the door handle on the driver’s side door is present and positioned approximately midway down the door. However, due to the entire vehicle being rendered in a crystalline, reflective material, the handle is not silver in color but instead matches the green and clear facets of the surrounding surface. Despite the change in material and color, the handle’s shape and placement are consistent with the original design. The fact that it is still visible and in the correct location suggests that the artist preserved this detail, even if its appearance has been altered by the artistic medium.",
