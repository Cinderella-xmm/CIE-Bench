        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted in a stylized, animated form with exaggerated facial features and proportions typical of cartoon or game art. Despite the artistic transformation, the subject's posture—seated at a table, facing forward with a relaxed demeanor—retains a similar composition to the original Mona Lisa. The expression on the face, while more overtly cheerful due to the animation style, still conveys a gentle, serene smile reminiscent of the original’s enigmatic smile. This suggests that although the visual style has changed significantly, the core emotional tone and pose are preserved. Comparing this to Image A (the classical painting), the original subject also sits with a composed, slightly tilted head and a subtle smile, which is mirrored here in a more expressive but conceptually aligned way. Thus, the iconic essence of the pose and smile is maintained, albeit reinterpreted through a modern, playful lens.",

      "question": "Is the subject still holding the mug with both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is clearly shown holding a dark-colored mug with both hands, mirroring the action seen in Image A. The positioning of the fingers and thumbs around the mug indicates a natural, balanced grip. This detail is consistent across both images, suggesting continuity in the subject’s interaction with the object. Even though the character in Image B is rendered in a 3D animated style, the gesture remains anatomically plausible and visually identical in function to the original. Therefore, based on the visual cues and common understanding of hand-object interactions, the subject continues to hold the mug with both hands.",

      "question": "Are the pancakes topped with berries present on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a white plate is visible on the wooden table, and it contains a golden-brown pancake. On top of the pancake, there are red and blue berries—specifically strawberries and blueberries—along with a small sprig of green mint. These toppings are clearly distinguishable and arranged in a manner consistent with a breakfast setting. This matches the depiction in Image A, where the same arrangement of pancakes and berries appears. The presence of these elements in both images indicates that the breakfast scene has been preserved, even if the artistic style differs. Given the clarity and consistency of the visual details, it is evident that the pancakes are indeed topped with berries.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a long, crusty loaf of bread is positioned on the table to the right of the plate with pancakes. Its shape and texture resemble a classic baguette, and it is partially cut, suggesting it has been used. This element is consistent with the scene in Image A, where the same loaf is present. The placement and appearance of the bread are clear and unambiguous in both images, indicating that it remains part of the breakfast setup. The inclusion of bread adds realism and context to the meal, reinforcing the idea of a full breakfast. Based on the visual evidence, the loaf of bread is definitely visible.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small ceramic vase is situated on the table near the edge, to the right of the loaf of bread. Inside the vase is a single white daisy with a yellow center, standing upright. This floral detail is consistent with Image A, where the same vase and flower appear. The daisy serves as a decorative element, contributing to the warm, inviting atmosphere of the breakfast scene. The vase’s size, shape, and placement are identical in both images, confirming its presence. Given the clear visibility and consistent representation across both versions, the vase with the daisy is indeed present on the table.",
