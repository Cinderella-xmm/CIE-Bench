      "question": "Is the sunset visible on the horizon with its reflection on the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is clearly visible on the horizon, positioned low in the sky, casting a warm orange and golden glow across the scene. This is consistent with a sunset. The reflection of the sun can be observed on the surface of the water, creating a shimmering path of light that extends from the horizon toward the shore. This visual cue aligns with natural phenomena during sunset when sunlight reflects off calm or gently rippling water. Based on this observation and general knowledge of how sunlight interacts with water at sunset, it is reasonable to conclude that the sunset and its reflection are present.",

      "question": "Does the sandy beach retain its texture and extend across the bottom of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground shows a sandy beach with visible texture, including footprints and subtle variations in sand elevation, which are typical of a natural beach environment. The sand stretches horizontally across the lower portion of the image, forming a continuous surface that meets the waterline. These visual details confirm that the beach retains its texture and spans the width of the frame. There is no indication of distortion or absence of sand, supporting the conclusion that the beach remains intact and textured as expected.",

      "question": "Are the ocean waves present, showing natural movement near the shore?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, gentle waves are visible approaching the shore, with white foam forming at their crests as they break. These waves exhibit natural undulation and motion patterns typical of coastal waters. The presence of small ripples and wavelets suggests ongoing water movement, consistent with a real ocean environment. The lighting enhances the visibility of these features, particularly the reflective highlights on the water's surface. Therefore, based on the visual cues and understanding of ocean dynamics, the waves appear to be naturally present and active near the shore.",

      "question": "Do the surfboards retain their original colors (yellow on the left, red and teal on the right) and upright positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfboard on the left is yellow, matching the original color seen in Image A. The surfboard on the right has vertical stripes of red and teal, which also corresponds to the original design. Both surfboards are held upright and positioned vertically in front of the pandas, maintaining the same orientation as in the original image. Despite the change in subjects, the surfboards' colors and positions have been preserved accurately. This consistency suggests that the editing process maintained key visual elements of the original composition.",

      "question": "Are the pandas positioned similarly to the original humans, with one arm holding the surfboard and both facing the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two pandas are standing upright on the beach, each holding a surfboard with one armâ€”specifically, the left panda holds the yellow board with its right arm, and the right panda holds the red-and-teal board with its left arm. Both pandas are oriented toward the sunset, just like the humans in Image A were. Their postures mirror the stance of the original figures, with bodies turned away from the viewer and facing the horizon. Although they are animals, their positioning replicates the human arrangement closely, suggesting intentional mimicry of the original composition. Thus, the pandas are positioned similarly to the original humans in terms of orientation and arm placement.",
