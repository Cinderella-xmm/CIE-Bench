      "question": "Is the lion’s head medallion present at the center of the desk's front panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a large, ornate book resting on a surface, with a quill and inkwell placed atop it. There is no visible desk in this image—only the book and writing implements are in the foreground. The background shows blurred bookshelves, but there is no clear view of a desk or its front panel. Therefore, the presence of a lion’s head medallion cannot be confirmed, as the desk itself is not present in the frame. This contrasts with Image A, where a detailed ornate desk with a central lion’s head medallion is clearly visible. Since Image B lacks the desk entirely, the medallion is absent.",

      "question": "Does the quill maintain its feather shape, even if stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quill is clearly visible and rests in a golden holder. Its form is elongated with a distinct feather-like structure, including barbs and a shaft, though rendered in a polished, metallic gold finish. While stylized due to the material and artistic design, the overall shape remains faithful to a traditional quill pen, preserving the feather’s silhouette. This aligns with common representations of quills in classical or decorative contexts, where the feather shape is maintained for symbolic or aesthetic reasons. Compared to Image A, where the quill is also feather-shaped but appears more naturalistic (with white feathers), Image B’s version is more ornamental but still retains the essential feather form.",

      "question": "Is the book depicted as open, showing two pages of aged, yellowed paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is closed and lying flat on a surface. The cover is richly decorated with embossed patterns and text along the spine, and a sheet of parchment paper lies on top of it. The parchment has lines and faint cursive script, suggesting it is meant for writing, but the book itself is not open. In contrast, Image A shows an open book with two visible pages of aged, yellowed paper. Thus, while both images feature books and writing materials, only Image A depicts an open book. The state of the book in Image B is closed, so the description of 'open' does not apply.",

      "question": "Does the desk retain its dark wood texture and finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a desk at all. Instead, it features a large leather-bound book resting on what appears to be a patterned rug or carpet. The surface beneath the book is not clearly identifiable as a desk, and no wooden furniture with a dark finish is visible. In Image A, the desk is prominently displayed with intricate carvings and a dark, polished wood finish. Since Image B lacks any desk, the question about its texture and finish is moot. The absence of the desk means that the dark wood texture cannot be observed or confirmed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is dimly lit and out of focus, showing only vague outlines of bookshelves. There is no visible window, let alone an arched one with leaded glass panes. The lighting suggests ambient illumination from an unseen source, but no architectural details like windows are discernible. In contrast, Image A clearly shows an arched window with a grid of leaded glass panes, framed by curtains and positioned directly behind the desk. The absence of such a feature in Image B confirms that the window is not present.",

      "question": "Are tall bookshelves with rows of leather-bound books visible to the left of the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes blurred bookshelves filled with books, but they are not clearly defined or positioned specifically to the left of a desk—because there is no desk in the image. The shelves appear in the distance, likely forming part of a library setting, and do contain numerous books that resemble leather-bound volumes. However, without a desk to anchor the spatial orientation, the 'left of the desk' reference is invalid. In Image A, tall bookshelves are clearly visible to the left of the desk, confirming their presence in that context. But since Image B lacks the desk, the relative positioning cannot be established.",

      "question": "Are the dominant colors dark brown, cream, and deep red/blue consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dominant colors include dark brown (from the leather-bound book and wooden elements), cream (from the parchment paper), and deep red with blue accents (from the patterned rug). These colors are consistent with the aesthetic of Image A, which features similar tones: dark wood furniture, cream-colored pages, and a richly colored rug. Both images share a classic, scholarly atmosphere with a palette rooted in earthy and warm hues. The visual harmony between the two images suggests intentional continuity in color scheme, even though the composition differs. Thus, despite the changes in objects and layout, the dominant color palette remains consistent.",
