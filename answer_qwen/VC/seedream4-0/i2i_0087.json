      "question": "Is the clock face still white after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the clock face appears uniformly white with no visible discoloration or additional markings. The surface of the clock face is consistent in tone and lacks any gradients or color shifts that would suggest a change from its original state. Based on common knowledge about clock design and visual consistency, a white clock face is typical for minimalist designs like this one. There is no indication of editing that would alter the base color of the face. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the clock face remains white.",

      "question": "Are both the hour and minute hands still black after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hour and minute hands are clearly visible and maintain a solid black color. Their shape and thickness are consistent with standard analog clock hands. There is no visual evidence of color alteration, such as fading, tinting, or shadowing that might suggest a change in hue. Comparing this to typical clock designs, black hands are commonly used for high contrast against white faces, which aligns with what is seen here. Since there are no signs of modification to their color, we can infer that both hands remain black.",

      "question": "Is there still a red second hand on the clock after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second hand in Image B is thin and distinctly colored red, contrasting sharply with the black hour and minute hands. This red color is consistent across its length and matches the typical design choice for second hands to enhance visibility. Given that the second hand's color has not changed and remains vividly red, and considering that such a feature is often preserved in edits to maintain functionality and aesthetics, it is safe to conclude that the red second hand is still present.",

      "question": "Is the orange pivot point still present after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the center of the clock where the hands meet, there is a small circular dot that serves as the pivot point. In Image B, this dot is clearly visible and appears to be orange in color. This detail is consistent with the design seen in many modern clocks, where a colored pivot adds a subtle aesthetic touch. Since the pivot point remains intact and retains its orange hue without any blurring or color shift, it can be concluded that the orange pivot point is still present after the edit.",

      "question": "Does the clock face remain free of numbers or markings after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the clock face shows no numerals, tick marks, or other indicators typically used to denote hours or minutes. The surface is smooth and unadorned, maintaining a minimalist aesthetic. This absence of markings is consistent with modern design trends for wall clocks that prioritize simplicity. There are no visible traces of added text or lines that would suggest the introduction of numbers or markings. Therefore, based on visual evidence and common design principles, the clock face remains free of numbers or markings.",
