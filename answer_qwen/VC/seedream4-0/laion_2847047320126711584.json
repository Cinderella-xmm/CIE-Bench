      "question": "Is the donut-shaped object retaining a circular form with a central hole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donut-shaped objects are anthropomorphized cartoon characters, but they still maintain the fundamental shape of a donut: a circular ring with a central hole. This is evident in both the leader donut in the top panel and the group of donuts in the bottom panel. The central hole is clearly visible in each character, even though they are stylized with arms, legs, and armor. The circular form is preserved as part of their design, consistent with the real-world appearance of donuts. This conclusion is based on visual recognition of the iconic donut shape, which is universally understood to be a ring with a hole in the center.",

      "question": "Does the donut retain its golden-brown baked color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon donuts are depicted with a golden-brown coloration that closely resembles the baked appearance of real donuts. This color is consistent across all the donut characters, suggesting a realistic representation despite the cartoon style. The golden-brown hue is typical of baked or fried donuts, especially those dusted with sugar. Even though the image is stylized, the color choice aligns with common expectations of how a baked donut should look, reinforcing the realism within the whimsical context.",

      "question": "Is the surface of the donut covered in visible coarse granulated sugar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the donut characters shows a textured coating that visually represents coarse granulated sugar. This is particularly noticeable on the top panel's lead donut and the group in the bottom panel. The texture appears as small, uneven dots across the surface, which is characteristic of sugar crystals. While this is a stylized representation, the visual cues—such as the speckled pattern and slight sheen—align with how coarse sugar would appear on a donut. The artistic rendering maintains enough detail to suggest granulated sugar, even if not perfectly realistic.",

      "question": "Are there visible individual sugar granules on the donut’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the donuts are stylized, the surface texture includes small, distinct specks that resemble individual sugar granules. These are especially noticeable on the donut in the top panel, where the sugar coating has a dotted pattern that suggests granular texture. Although these are not photorealistic, the artistic style uses size and spacing to imply the presence of separate sugar particles. In cartoon illustrations, such details are often exaggerated or simplified for clarity, but the intention to depict individual granules is clear from the visual design.",

      "question": "Is the donut’s body formed as a continuous ring with a central opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each donut character is designed with a continuous ring structure and a central opening, which is consistent with the physical form of a traditional donut. The hole in the center is clearly defined in all instances, and the outer ring is unbroken, forming a complete loop. This structural feature is maintained even with added limbs and armor, indicating that the core shape of the donut is preserved. The continuity of the ring is essential to the identity of a donut, and this is faithfully represented in the cartoon depiction.",
