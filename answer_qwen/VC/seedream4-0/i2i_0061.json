      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted in a watercolor-style rendering. Despite the artistic transformation, the shape and color of the cap are clearly identifiable as dark, consistent with a black cap. The cap appears to be positioned correctly on his head, with visible details such as the brim and what seems to be a logo or text on the front. Although the style is painterly, the overall structure and placement suggest that the cap remains intact and visible. Comparing this to Image A, where the cap is clearly visible and worn properly, the edited version preserves this detail even with stylistic changes. The watercolor effect does not obscure the cap’s presence or integrity.",

      "question": "Is the man still balancing on the skateboard, with the skateboard positioned on the edge of the ramp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is shown in a dynamic pose typical of skateboarding, with one foot on the board and the other slightly lifted. The skateboard appears to be placed at the edge of a ramp-like structure, which is consistent with a skateboarding trick. Although the image has a watercolor effect, the silhouette and positioning of the skateboard relative to the ramp remain clear. In Image A, the skateboard is visibly on the edge of the ramp, and the man is balancing during a trick. The edited version maintains this spatial relationship, suggesting continuity in the action. The artistic style softens edges but does not alter the fundamental composition, so the skateboard's position on the ramp is preserved.",

      "question": "Are the man's arms extended outward to aid in balancing during the trick?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's arms are clearly depicted in an outstretched position—one arm raised high above his head and the other extended to the side. This posture is characteristic of balancing during a skateboarding maneuver. The extension of the arms helps maintain equilibrium, a common technique used by skaters. Even though the image is rendered in watercolor, the arm positions are distinct and match the physics of balance in skateboarding. In Image A, the same arm positions are present, indicating that the edited version accurately preserves this detail. The artistic style enhances the fluidity of motion without distorting the functional posture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's footwear is visible and rendered in dark tones consistent with black skate shoes. The design includes elements like laces and a thick sole, typical of skate shoes. The watercolor style may soften the details, but the overall shape and color remain recognizable. Comparing to Image A, the original photo shows clearly defined black skate shoes, and the edited version retains this feature despite the artistic transformation. The shoes appear intact and properly positioned on the feet, confirming their presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's shorts are light-colored, appearing in shades of beige or tan, consistent with khaki. The cut of the shorts is short and frayed at the bottom, matching the style seen in Image A. The watercolor rendering gives the fabric a softer appearance, but the color and form remain aligned with khaki shorts. The original image confirms this attire, and the edited version preserves it, albeit with a more painterly texture. Therefore, the shorts are still identifiable as khaki.",
