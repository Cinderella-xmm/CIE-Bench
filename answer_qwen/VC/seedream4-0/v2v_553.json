      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the panda is clearly depicted with the characteristic black-and-white fur pattern typical of giant pandas. The black patches around the eyes, ears, and limbs contrast sharply with the white fur on the face, torso, and other areas. This coloration is consistent with real-world pandas and is preserved in the stylized representation. The artistic rendering maintains these distinct markings, even though the overall style is more cartoonish or toy-like. Therefore, based on visual cues and biological knowledge of pandas, the fur pattern is retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the panda is holding a staff in its right hand. At the top of the staff, there is a bright, glowing orb emitting light, which indicates that it is a magical or enchanted object. This glow is visually distinct and contrasts with the darker surroundings, suggesting active illumination. The staff's design includes a flame-like tip, reinforcing the idea of magical energy. Based on common fantasy tropes where wizards or magical beings wield glowing staves, this object is clearly intended to be a glowing staff. Therefore, the panda is indeed holding a glowing staff.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a golden banner at the top of the frame with the word 'Harmony' written on it in clear, legible text. This banner is part of the display box design, positioned above the panda figure. While the word 'Harmony' appears in both images, in Image B it is presented as a decorative ribbon within a framed collectible-style display, rather than painted on a wall. The font and placement are consistent with a label or title for the character or item. Thus, the presence of a 'HARMONY' banner is confirmed in the background (within the frame).",

      "question": "Is the panda depicted as riding the horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the panda is seated atop a white horse, with its legs positioned in stirrups and hands holding the reins. The posture and positioning clearly indicate that the panda is mounted on the horse. The horse stands still, and the panda is centered on its back, consistent with the act of riding. This depiction aligns with common representations of riders on horses in art and media. Even though the style is stylized and cartoonish, the spatial relationship between the panda and the horse confirms that the panda is riding the horse.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the panda is wearing a dark, ornate robe that features a hood covering the head. The hood drapes over the panda’s ears and back, forming a classic hooded silhouette commonly associated with cloaks or wizard robes. The robe has decorative gold patterns along the edges, further emphasizing its ceremonial or magical nature. The hood is not pulled tightly over the face but remains open enough to show the panda’s facial features, yet it retains the general hooded shape. This design is consistent with fantasy attire, and the visual cues confirm the presence of a hooded robe.",
