      "question": "Is the mouth wide open in a roaring expression with visible teeth and tongue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure on the far right (Modern Era) has its mouth wide open, consistent with a roaring or exerting expression. The mouth is drawn with an open shape that reveals teeth and a visible tongue, which aligns with typical artistic depictions of intense effort or vocalization during physical activity. This visual cue, combined with common knowledge of how artists represent exertion in strength-related scenes (e.g., weightlifting), supports the conclusion that the mouth is indeed open in a roaring manner. The other two figures also show similar expressions, but the question focuses on the modern figure, whose features are clearly defined.",

      "question": "Are the eyes narrowed and focused, indicating anger or exertion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The modern figure in Image B has eyes that are tightly closed or nearly closed, with pronounced eyebrows furrowed downward, suggesting intense focus or strain. This is consistent with common depictions of individuals lifting heavy weights, where facial tension indicates exertion. While the eyes are not 'narrowed' in the sense of being squinted horizontally, they appear compressed due to muscle tension around the eye area, which is typical in such scenarios. Given that the figure is lifting a barbell, this facial expression is plausible and aligns with world knowledge about human behavior during physical strain.",

      "question": "Does the head have a balding crown with hair along the sides and back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The modern figure in Image B has short, spiky hair covering the entire scalp, including the top, sides, and back. There is no indication of balding at the crown; instead, the hair appears full and evenly distributed. This contrasts with typical representations of balding patterns, which would show thinning or absence of hair on the top of the head. Therefore, based on visual evidence and common understanding of hair distribution patterns, the head does not exhibit a balding crown.",

      "question": "Is the jawline strong and angular, with a defined chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The modern figure in Image B displays a prominent jawline that is sharp and angular, especially noticeable when viewed from the side profile. The chin is well-defined and projects outward, contributing to a strong facial structure. This feature is typical in illustrations of muscular or athletic individuals, where a chiseled jawline enhances the perception of strength and masculinity. The line work emphasizes the contours of the jaw and chin, making them clearly visible and distinct.",

      "question": "Is the head located at the top center of the figure, aligned with the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The modern figure in Image B has the head positioned directly above the torso, centered along the vertical axis of the body. The neck connects smoothly to the shoulders, and the head is upright, maintaining alignment with the spine. This anatomical positioning is consistent with proper posture and balance, especially in a standing pose like weightlifting. The illustration follows standard human anatomy principles, ensuring that the head remains aligned with the spinal column for structural integrity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The modern figure in Image B has a smooth face with no visible facial hair. There are no indications of a beard, mustache, or stubble. The chin and upper lip areas are cleanly outlined without any shading or lines that would suggest hair growth. This aligns with common depictions of athletes or fitness models who often maintain a clean-shaven appearance. Based on the clear absence of facial hair in the illustration, it can be concluded that the face is clean-shaven.",
