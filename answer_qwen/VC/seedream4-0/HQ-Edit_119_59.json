      "question": "Is the barbell rod visibly present and gripped by both hands across the lifter's upper back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the barbell is clearly visible and held horizontally by both hands of the lifter. The barbell is positioned across the upper back, just below the neck, which is consistent with a standard barbell back squat or deadlift stance. The grip appears firm and symmetrical, with the barbell resting on the lifter’s shoulders. This positioning aligns with proper weightlifting form, where the barbell is supported by the upper back and trapezius muscles. The visual cues confirm that the barbell rod is present and being gripped correctly.",

      "question": "Are the lifter’s arms and legs clearly defined with prominent muscle mass, particularly in the biceps, triceps, and quadriceps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lifter’s physique is stylized with exaggerated muscular definition typical of animated or cartoon representations. The arms show pronounced biceps and triceps, and the legs display well-defined quadriceps and hamstrings. While the style is not photorealistic, the muscle groups are clearly delineated and emphasized, especially in the upper arms and thighs. This level of detail is common in illustrated fitness characters to convey strength and athleticism. Therefore, based on visual evidence and understanding of artistic representation in fitness media, the answer is affirmative.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large vertical mirror is clearly visible directly behind the lifter. The reflection shows the back of the lifter’s torso, arms, and partial view of the gym environment, including weights and windows. The mirror extends from floor to ceiling and reflects the lifter’s image accurately, indicating its presence and function. This setup is common in gyms for form checking during lifts. The visual evidence confirms the existence of such a mirror.",
