      "question": "Does the boot retain the same shape and arrangement of the elongated oval cutouts on the side panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot is crafted entirely from wood, with visible grain patterns mimicking leather. The elongated oval cutouts on the side panels are present and appear to maintain their original shape and arrangement. These cutouts are evenly spaced and aligned vertically along the side of the boot, consistent with typical hiking boot design for ventilation and flexibility. Despite being made of wood, the carving accurately replicates the form and positioning seen in standard hiking boots. There is no visual distortion or repositioning of these features, indicating that the shape and arrangement have been preserved.",

      "question": "Are the eyelets positioned in the same vertical alignment and spacing as in the original boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyelets are carved into the wooden structure of the boot and follow a vertical alignment that matches the typical lacing pattern of hiking boots. The spacing between the eyelets appears consistent with standard boot designs, with each eyelet evenly distributed along the shaft. While the material has changed from metal or plastic to wood, the placement and spacing remain faithful to the original configuration. This suggests that the designer maintained the structural integrity and aesthetic proportions of the original boot.",

      "question": "Does the outsole retain the exact tread pattern and groove depth as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outsole in Image B is carved from wood and features a detailed tread pattern that closely resembles the one typically found on hiking boots. The grooves and lugs are clearly defined and follow a similar pattern to those in real hiking boots, designed for grip and durability. However, due to the nature of wood carving, there may be slight variations in groove depth and sharpness compared to a rubber outsole. Nevertheless, the overall tread pattern and its layout are preserved, suggesting that the design intent was to replicate the original's functionality and appearance as closely as possible.",

      "question": "Is the toe cap present and shaped identically to the original, including its rounded front and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toe cap is clearly visible and carved from wood. It maintains a rounded front shape consistent with the design of hiking boots, which are built to protect the toes during rugged terrain use. The position of the toe cap relative to the rest of the boot is accurate, sitting at the front end and extending slightly over the sole. Although the material is wood instead of rubber or synthetic composite, the shape and placement are identical to what would be expected in an original hiking boot. Therefore, the toe cap’s form and function are preserved.",

      "question": "Is the padded collar at the top of the boot preserved in shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the padded collar at the top of the boot is represented through wood carving. While padding cannot exist in wood, the shape and contour of the collar are faithfully replicated. It follows the same curved silhouette and sits at the correct height relative to the boot shaft, maintaining the ergonomic design intended to support the ankle. The absence of actual padding does not affect the preservation of the collar’s shape and position, as the sculptural representation aligns with the original boot’s anatomy.",

      "question": "Is the boot positioned in the same side profile with the same forward tilt as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot is displayed in a side profile view, resting on a wooden shelf. The orientation shows a slight forward tilt, with the heel elevated slightly higher than the toe, which is consistent with how hiking boots are often posed for display. Comparing this to the original boot in Image A, which is also shown in a side profile with a similar forward tilt, it is evident that the positioning has been preserved. The angle and perspective are nearly identical, suggesting intentional replication of the original’s presentation.",

      "question": "Is the tongue of the boot visible and shaped similarly to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tongue of the boot is visible and carved to resemble the typical padded tongue found in hiking boots. It extends upward from the lacing area and is shaped to fit within the boot’s opening, following the same contours as in a real boot. Although it lacks softness or fabric texture, the wood carving captures the essential shape and placement of the tongue. The laces pass through it in a manner consistent with standard boot construction, indicating that the tongue’s form has been preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heel counter is clearly defined in the wood carving. It forms a reinforced structure at the back of the boot, curving around the heel area to provide support—a key feature in hiking boots. The shape is consistent with the original, featuring a robust, slightly raised design that wraps around the heel. Although made of wood rather than synthetic materials, the carving accurately reflects the original’s structural form and positioning, preserving both function and aesthetics.",
