      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the intricate iron lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower present, including its characteristic crisscross pattern and open framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is clearly visible within a glass dome. The tower's iconic iron lattice design is meticulously rendered, with the crisscrossing beams and open framework evident in both the lower and upper sections. This structural detail is consistent with real-world knowledge of the Eiffel Tower’s construction, which features a complex network of wrought-iron trusses. The visual clarity and precision of these elements confirm that the intricate lattice structure is present and accurately represented.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the arched base of the Eiffel Tower visible, with a clear central passage beneath the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the Eiffel Tower in Image B shows the characteristic arches forming a central passageway underneath the tower. This architectural feature is faithfully reproduced, allowing a view through the structure toward the background. The presence of this open space aligns with the actual design of the Eiffel Tower, where visitors can walk under the arches. The lighting and depth within the image further emphasize the visibility of this passage.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the spire and crown structure at the very top of the Eiffel Tower present and clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the apex of the Eiffel Tower in Image B, the spire and crown are clearly visible. The pointed tip, along with the small antenna-like structure atop it, matches the known silhouette of the Eiffel Tower. The crown section, though stylized slightly due to scale, retains enough detail to be recognizable. This includes the observation deck and the final vertical extension, confirming that the topmost elements are present and well-defined.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the rows of lampposts and bare-branched trees symmetrically arranged along both sides of the central path leading to the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pathway leading to the Eiffel Tower is flanked by evenly spaced lampposts and snow-covered, leafless trees on both sides. These elements are aligned in a symmetrical fashion, creating a balanced composition typical of Parisian boulevards. The repetition and spacing suggest intentional symmetry, reinforcing the aesthetic order often seen in urban planning around major landmarks like the Eiffel Tower. The visual consistency supports this interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there figures in the foreground positioned facing the Eiffel Tower, with some appearing to take photographs or observe it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Several small human figures are visible in the foreground of Image B, standing on the cobblestone path and oriented toward the Eiffel Tower. Some appear to be holding devices resembling cameras, suggesting they are taking photos. Others are seated or standing in contemplative poses, indicating observation. Their positioning and posture align with common tourist behavior at such iconic sites, supporting the conclusion that they are engaging with the tower as viewers or photographers.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central pathway extend directly toward the Eiffel Tower, creating a strong linear perspective with convergence at the tower’s base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central pathway in Image B is designed to lead directly toward the Eiffel Tower, with parallel lines formed by the edges of the path, lampposts, and trees converging toward the base of the tower. This creates a strong sense of linear perspective, drawing the viewer’s eye into the scene. Such compositional techniques are commonly used in art and photography to emphasize depth and focus on a central subject. The alignment and diminishing size of objects reinforce this effect.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ground fully covered in snow, with visible accumulation around the base of the tower and along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ground in Image B is entirely blanketed in snow, with thick layers visible along the edges of the path and around the base of the Eiffel Tower. Snow also accumulates on the branches of trees and lampposts, enhancing the wintry atmosphere. The texture and distribution of the snow are consistent with a snowy environment, and the way it covers surfaces indicates full coverage. This aligns with the seasonal setting implied by the scene.",
