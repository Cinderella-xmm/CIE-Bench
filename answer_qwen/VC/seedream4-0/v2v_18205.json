      "question": "Is the horse depicted with a dark mane running along its neck and a long, dark tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse has a light-colored mane and tail, both of which appear to be cream or off-white in color, contrasting with its rich brown body. The mane is wavy and flows down the neck, but it is not dark. Similarly, the tail is long and also light in color, not dark. This observation is based on visual cues such as color contrast and texture. Drawing from world knowledge, horses can have various mane and tail colors, but in this image, they are clearly not dark. Therefore, the description of a dark mane and tail does not match the visual evidence.",

      "question": "Does the elephant have two visible, curved white tusks extending from its mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant has two prominent tusks that curve outward and downward from its mouth. These tusks are light in color, appearing white or off-white, consistent with the typical appearance of elephant tusks. The curvature and positioning are natural and anatomically accurate for an elephant. Based on visual inspection and biological knowledge, elephants commonly possess such tusks, and they are clearly visible here. Thus, the presence of two curved white tusks is confirmed.",

      "question": "Is there a flat wooden platform positioned between the horse and the elephant, supporting the horse and resting on the elephant’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a flat wooden platform is clearly visible between the horse and the elephant. The horse stands on top of this platform, which is balanced across the back of the elephant. The platform appears to be made of wood, with visible grain and edges, and it serves as a structural support. This setup is consistent with the idea of a load-bearing surface placed between two animals. From a physical perspective, such a platform would need to be strong enough to support the horse's weight, and its placement suggests intentional design. Therefore, the presence of this platform is evident.",

      "question": "Are both the horse and the elephant depicted in profile view, facing toward the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the horse and the elephant are shown in profile, meaning their bodies are oriented sideways, allowing a clear view of their lateral forms. Both animals are facing toward the left side of the image, as indicated by the direction of their heads and trunks (for the elephant) and the orientation of their legs and bodies. This is a common artistic convention for depicting animals in a realistic manner, especially when emphasizing anatomy and proportion. The alignment of both animals in the same direction supports this conclusion.",

      "question": "Does the elephant have a long, segmented trunk that curls upward at the tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant’s trunk is long and visibly segmented, with distinct folds and textures that suggest flexibility and musculature. The tip of the trunk curls upward slightly, which is a characteristic behavior seen in elephants, especially when they are exploring or holding objects. The segmentation is apparent through the ridges along the trunk’s length, and the curling at the end aligns with known elephant anatomy. Therefore, the trunk matches the description provided.",

      "question": "Is the background a uniform beige color with a subtle paper-like texture and no additional scenery or objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is predominantly a uniform beige tone, with a soft gradient effect that becomes darker toward the edges, particularly on the right side. While there is a subtle texture that resembles aged paper or canvas, it is not entirely uniform due to the lighting gradient. However, there are no additional objects, scenery, or elements in the background—only the animals and the platform are present. The texture is minimal and consistent with a studio-style backdrop. Given the context, the background can be described as mostly uniform with a slight variation due to lighting, but it lacks any extraneous details.",

      "question": "Is the horse’s body primarily a rich brown color with black lower legs, mane, and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse’s body is indeed a rich brown color, but its mane and tail are not black—they are light, almost cream or white in color. Additionally, the lower legs of the horse are not black; they are lighter, matching the color of the rest of the limbs, including the hooves. This contrasts with the description in the question. Based on visual analysis and comparison with real-world equine anatomy, horses can have dark legs, but in this case, the legs are not black. Therefore, while the body color is correct, the mane, tail, and leg colors do not match the description.",
