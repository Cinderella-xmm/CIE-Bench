      "question": "Does the edited image retain the layered petal structure around the rim of each vase, with individual petal shapes clearly visible and arranged in concentric rows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vases have a distinct floral or artichoke-like embossed design on their interior surfaces, but this pattern is not located around the rim. Instead, it is centrally positioned within the bowl-shaped cavity. The exterior of the vases does not display a layered petal structure around the rim as seen in typical lotus-inspired designs. Rather, the vases have a smooth, rounded form with marbled texture and gold accents, lacking any outward-facing petal layers. Therefore, the layered petal structure described in the question is absent in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are there exactly two vases present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a black presentation box labeled 'Earth Elegance' containing two ceramic vases. Both vases are clearly visible inside separate compartments of the box. Each vase has a similar shape and design, with a bulbous body, narrow neck, and an open top. There are no additional vases or objects that could be mistaken for vases. Thus, based on visual evidence, there are exactly two vases present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the interior of each vase still open and bowl-shaped, allowing visibility into the cavity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both vases are shown from a side angle that reveals their open tops. The interiors are clearly visible, showing a bowl-shaped cavity with a raised, embossed floral design at the bottom. The openness of the top allows full visibility into the cavity, consistent with the description of being bowl-shaped and accessible. This is a standard feature of decorative vases designed for holding small items or displaying flowers. Therefore, the interior is indeed open and bowl-shaped.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does each vase have a distinct, flared pedestal base beneath the main body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the vases do not have a flared pedestal base. Instead, they rest directly on a flat surface within the box, with a smooth, rounded lower portion that tapers slightly to meet the base. The base appears to be solid and integrated into the body without any flaring or elevated foot structure. A flared pedestal base would typically extend outward from the bottom of the vase, which is not observed here. Hence, the vases lack such a feature.",

      "question": "Are the two vases identical in shape, size, and orientation, with only minor positional offset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The two vases in Image B appear nearly identical in shape and size. Both have the same bulbous body, narrow neck, and internal floral motif. Their placement in the box is symmetrical, with one on the left and one on the right, suggesting minimal positional variation. The orientation of both vases is consistentâ€”upright and facing forward. Any differences are negligible and likely due to slight manufacturing variations or lighting effects. Given these observations, they can be considered identical in form and orientation, differing only by position.",
