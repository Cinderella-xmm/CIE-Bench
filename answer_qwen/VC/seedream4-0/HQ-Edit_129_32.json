      "question": "Is the ornate bow featuring symmetrical scrollwork and multiple spherical finials present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow of the key is clearly visible and features intricate scrollwork with a symmetrical design. The decorative elements include multiple spherical finials positioned at various points around the scrollwork, consistent with traditional ornamental keys. The symmetry and placement of these elements appear to match typical craftsmanship seen in antique or decorative keys. Based on visual inspection, the bow retains its detailed structure, including the central floral-like motif and surrounding loops, which are balanced on both sides. There is no evidence of distortion or alteration in the pattern or finial arrangement. Therefore, the bow appears unchanged from what would be expected in an original design.",

      "question": "Is the double-notched bit at the end of the key preserved in its original H-shaped configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bit of the key in Image B is clearly visible and exhibits a distinct H-shaped configuration with two notches forming the horizontal bars of the 'H'. This shape is consistent with traditional skeleton keys, where the bit is designed to fit specific lock mechanisms. The proportions and spacing between the notches appear uniform and intact, indicating that the original form has been preserved. There are no signs of deformation, such as rounded edges or missing sections, that would suggest modification. Given the clarity and sharpness of the image, the H-shape is accurately represented.",

      "question": "Are the textured bands along the shaft preserved in their original placement and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shaft of the key in Image B shows several textured bands—specifically, raised circular ridges and grooves that run along its length. These bands are evenly spaced and maintain a consistent width and depth, suggesting they have been preserved in their original form. The texture appears to be part of the key’s decorative design, likely intended to enhance grip or aesthetic appeal. The alignment and continuity of these bands from the bow to the bit indicate no disruption or alteration. Based on common design practices for ornamental keys, this type of banding is typically symmetrical and precisely crafted, and here it appears undisturbed.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the key rendered in the original aged golden brass tone with visible highlights and shadows indicating metallic texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The key in Image B displays a warm, golden brass coloration with subtle variations in tone that suggest aging and patina, consistent with antique metalwork. Highlights and shadows are clearly visible across the surface, particularly on the curved edges and raised portions of the bow and shaft, indicating a reflective, metallic finish. These lighting effects create a sense of depth and three-dimensionality, reinforcing the perception of real metal texture. The material appearance aligns with expectations for aged brass, which often develops a slightly darker, mottled surface over time. The rendering captures the interplay of light and shadow effectively, supporting the conclusion that the metallic texture is authentically represented.",

      "question": "Are the spherical finials positioned symmetrically around the scrollwork in the bow as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow of the key features multiple spherical finials distributed around the scrollwork. Upon close inspection, these finials are arranged in a mirrored fashion on both sides of the central axis of the bow, maintaining symmetry. For example, each loop in the scrollwork is adorned with a finial at corresponding positions, ensuring balance in the overall design. This symmetry is characteristic of classical ornamental keys, where aesthetic harmony is paramount. The even spacing and alignment of the finials suggest careful craftsmanship and adherence to the original design. There is no indication of asymmetry or misplacement.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the key proportionally accurate, with the bow, shaft, and bit maintaining their original relative dimensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The key in Image B maintains proportional accuracy across its components. The bow is large and elaborate, occupying approximately one-third of the total length, which is typical for decorative keys. The shaft is long and slender, connecting the bow to the bit without any apparent distortion. The bit is relatively short compared to the shaft, but its size is appropriate for a functional yet ornamental key. The relative dimensions between the bow, shaft, and bit appear consistent with traditional designs, where the bow is the most prominent feature, followed by the shaft, and then the bit. There is no sign of elongation, compression, or scaling errors that would compromise the key's proportionality. The overall silhouette matches expected standards for such keys.",
