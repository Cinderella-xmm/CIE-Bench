      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped with a grayish-blue iris and visible upper and lower eyelashes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is stylized in a cartoon or chibi art style. The eyes are large, round, and exaggerated for expressive effect, typical of such designs. They have black pupils with white highlights, but no discernible iris color—especially not grayish-blue. Additionally, there are no visible upper or lower eyelashes; instead, the eye shape is simplified into smooth curves without fine details. This contrasts sharply with realistic human anatomy, where almond-shaped eyes and distinct eyelashes are common features. Therefore, based on visual cues and knowledge of cartoon design conventions, the eyes do not match the description.",

      "question": "Is there a receding hairline with thin, light gray hair present only on the sides and back of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized, cartoon-like figure with a rounded head and simplified hair design. The hair is dark brown, thick, and uniformly styled across the top and sides, with no indication of thinning or a receding hairline. In contrast to real-life depictions of balding patterns, this character's hair is dense and covers the entire scalp area shown. There is no visual evidence of light gray hair or any sign of hair loss restricted to the sides and back. Thus, based on the artistic style and visual information, the description does not apply.",

      "question": "Does the shirt have thin vertical red and white stripes running along the collar and down the placket on a dark blue background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s shirt is rendered in a cartoon style with clear, bold lines. The shirt has a dark blue base color, and thin vertical stripes in red and white are visible along the collar, placket, and sleeves. These stripes are consistent in pattern and spacing, matching the description provided. While the rendering is stylized, the presence of these specific colors and stripe patterns aligns with the original clothing design seen in Image A (as inferred from context). Therefore, despite the artistic simplification, the key visual elements of the shirt's pattern are preserved.",

      "question": "Is there a visible white button at the top of the shirt’s placket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt features a placket with a single visible white button near the top. Although the character is stylized, the button is clearly depicted as circular and white, positioned centrally on the placket. This matches the typical design of a dress shirt, where buttons are placed vertically along the front. Even though the image is not photorealistic, the button is present and identifiable due to its contrasting color and placement. Therefore, based on visual inspection and common garment design principles, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Does the gray blazer have a notched lapel with a defined edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character wears a jacket that appears to be a stylized version of a blazer. However, the jacket lacks the characteristic notched lapel seen in formal outerwear. Instead, it has a simple, rounded collar without a distinct notch or sharp angular edge. The design is more akin to a child’s toy or figurine representation, where structural details like lapels are simplified or omitted for aesthetic reasons. Given the cartoon style and absence of a clear V-shaped notch, the blazer does not feature a notched lapel. Therefore, based on both visual cues and fashion terminology, the answer is negative.",

      "question": "Are fine lines visible around the eyes and forehead, and is the skin texture subtly detailed with pores?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a highly stylized, cartoon-like face with smooth, glossy skin. There are no fine lines around the eyes or forehead, nor any indication of pores or natural skin texture. The facial features are simplified and exaggerated for cuteness, typical of chibi or kawaii art styles. Realistic aging signs like wrinkles or skin imperfections are absent. In contrast, real human faces often show such details, especially in older individuals. Since this is an artistic rendering meant to appear youthful and idealized, the lack of fine details is intentional. Therefore, based on visual analysis and understanding of cartoon aesthetics, the answer is no.",
