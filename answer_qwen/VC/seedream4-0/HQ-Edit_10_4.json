      "question": "Is the fan-shaped arrangement of tightly coiled braids forming the crown hairstyle preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hairstyle appears to be transformed into a sculpted, carved wooden form rather than natural hair. The original fan-shaped arrangement of tightly coiled braids is no longer visible as individual braids but has been stylized into a smooth, rounded, and highly structured dome-like shape with vertical grooves that mimic the texture of braids. While the overall silhouette retains a similar upward and outward flare, the distinct coiled structure is replaced by a solid, carved appearance. Therefore, although the general shape may suggest a crown-like form, the specific detail of tightly coiled braids arranged in a fan shape is not preserved. This transformation reflects an artistic reinterpretation where realism is traded for symbolic or sculptural representation.",

      "question": "Is the multicolored beaded headband encircling the forehead, with its distinct rainbow-colored bead pattern, present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headband remains present and maintains its position around the forehead. However, it is now rendered in a carved wooden style, consistent with the rest of the figure. The beads are still visible as colored inlays within the wood, arranged in a pattern that suggests the rainbow-colored sequence seen in the original. Although the material has changed from actual beads to painted or inlaid wooden elements, the design and placement of the multicolored bands are preserved. The visual logic supports continuity in pattern and function despite the medium shift. Thus, the headband's presence and its characteristic rainbow bead pattern are retained, albeit in a stylized form.",

      "question": "Are the large circular beaded earrings with concentric patterns visible and correctly positioned on both ears in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The earrings in Image B are clearly visible and positioned on both ears, just as in the original. They maintain their circular shape and concentric design, though they are now crafted from carved wood with painted or inlaid colors to simulate beads. The intricate layered patterns are preserved, indicating that the artist intended to retain the aesthetic and cultural significance of the jewelry. Despite the change in material, the form, size, and positioning remain faithful to the original. This suggests a deliberate preservation of symbolic adornment even in a sculptural interpretation.",

      "question": "Is the horizontal band of multicolored beadwork around the neckline preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horizontal band around the neckline is present and accurately rendered. It features multiple rows of colorful inlays that replicate the beadwork seen in the original image. The pattern is detailed and follows the same layout—horizontal stripes with alternating colors and textures—though executed in wood carving. The craftsmanship ensures that the decorative intent and visual impact of the beadwork are maintained. Therefore, while the medium has changed, the structural and aesthetic elements of the necklace-like band are preserved.",

      "question": "Are the vertical geometric patterns on the front of the garment preserved in their original positions and orientations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vertical geometric patterns on the front of the garment in Image B are indeed preserved in terms of position and orientation. These patterns are carved into the wooden surface, mimicking the textile designs of the original. The alignment and spacing of the motifs match the original image closely, suggesting a careful translation of the fabric’s design into a three-dimensional relief. The symmetry and directionality of the patterns are maintained, indicating that the artist prioritized fidelity to the original composition despite the shift in medium. Thus, the visual structure and layout of the garment’s front are faithfully reproduced.",

      "question": "Is the left sleeve’s blue fabric with golden leaf-like embroidery visible and accurately rendered in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left sleeve is depicted in a dark brown, wood-carved texture, consistent with the rest of the figure. While the original sleeve featured blue fabric with golden leaf-like embroidery, this detail is not present in the edited version. Instead, the sleeve is uniformly textured with carved lines and patterns that resemble abstract ornamentation, but there is no visible blue color or gold leaf motif. The transformation into a wooden sculpture has resulted in the loss of the original fabric’s color and embroidery details. Therefore, the specific visual characteristics of the sleeve have been altered significantly.",

      "question": "Is the subject’s pose and gaze direction (facing slightly to the right) preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B maintains the same pose and gaze direction as in the original: the head is turned slightly to the right, and the facial expression is serene and forward-facing. The angle of the shoulders, neck, and head alignment are consistent with the original, indicating that the sculptural representation preserves the figure’s orientation. Even though the medium has changed, the spatial relationship between the face and body remains unchanged. This suggests that the artist aimed to retain the subject’s dignity and composure through accurate replication of posture and gaze.",

      "question": "Is the lush tropical background with dense foliage and warm lighting preserved in the edited image, albeit interpreted as low-relief carving?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been reinterpreted as a low-relief wooden carving, featuring intricate patterns of leaves, trees, and landscape elements. While the original background was a painted, vibrant jungle scene with soft lighting and depth, the edited version uses carved textures and shadows to evoke a similar environment. The dense foliage and warm tones are preserved in spirit, though translated into a monochromatic, sculptural form. The use of relief carving effectively conveys the sense of a lush, natural setting, even if the visual richness of color and light is reduced. Thus, the essence of the background is maintained, albeit in a different artistic medium.",
