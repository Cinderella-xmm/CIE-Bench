      "question": "Does the edited image retain the black and white stripes covering the zebra's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is depicted with distinct black and white stripes across its entire body, including the head, neck, torso, legs, and tail. These stripes are consistent with the typical pattern seen in real zebras, although the style appears more stylized or cartoonish. The stripes are continuous and cover all visible parts of the zebra’s body, indicating that the fundamental characteristic of zebra striping has been preserved. This observation aligns with world knowledge that zebras are known for their unique black-and-white striped coats, which serve purposes such as camouflage and insect deterrence. Even though the zebra in this image appears to be a toy or stylized representation, the stripe pattern remains intact.",

      "question": "Are the ears of the zebra in the edited image still upright?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's ears are clearly visible and positioned upright, pointing forward. This posture is consistent with alertness in animals, especially in species like zebras that rely on vigilance for predator detection. While the ears appear slightly exaggerated in shape—typical of cartoon or toy representations—they maintain an upright orientation. Comparing this to real zebras, which often hold their ears upright when attentive, the depiction in Image B aligns with natural behavior, albeit in a stylized form. Therefore, despite the artistic interpretation, the ears remain upright.",

      "question": "Is there a visible mane on the zebra's neck in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra has a short, upright mane along the back of its neck. Although it is simplified and stylized compared to the flowing manes of real zebras, the presence of a mane-like structure is evident. In reality, zebras have stiff, upright manes that run from the head to the shoulders. The edited image retains this feature, albeit in a more cartoonish form, suggesting a deliberate effort to preserve key anatomical traits even in a playful design. Thus, while not realistic in texture or detail, a visible mane is present.",

      "question": "Does the zebra in the edited image still have a tail with a tuft of hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra has a tail that ends in a dark, rounded tip resembling a tuft of hair. Real zebras have tails with dark, brush-like tufts at the end, used for swatting flies. The tail in this image, while simplified and possibly made of plastic or rubber (as suggested by the toy-like appearance), still features this tufted end. This detail is consistent with both biological accuracy and common depictions in children’s toys. Hence, even though the tail is stylized, the tuft of hair is visibly present.",

      "question": "Is the zebra depicted in a standing posture in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is shown with all four legs firmly planted on the ground, maintaining balance and stability. Its body is upright, and there is no indication of movement such as walking or running. This static, balanced stance is characteristic of a standing posture. Real zebras typically stand in similar positions when resting or observing their surroundings. The toy-like nature of the zebra does not affect this assessment, as the limbs are positioned in a way that supports a standing pose. Therefore, the zebra is clearly depicted in a standing posture.",
