      "question": "Is the skater depicted in a mid-air crouched posture with both arms extended outward for balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is clearly airborne and in a crouched position, which is typical during skateboarding tricks such as ollies or kickflips. His body is bent at the knees, and both arms are extended outward from his torso, which is consistent with balancing techniques used in mid-air maneuvers. This posture helps maintain stability and control during flight. The visual cues—such as the positioning of the limbs and the dynamic pose—align with real-world skateboarding physics and biomechanics, where arm extension aids in balance. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and common knowledge of skateboarding dynamics, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Is the skater’s left foot placed firmly on the skateboard while the right foot is slightly raised off the board?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the skater's feet in Image B, the left foot appears to be planted firmly on the tail end of the skateboard, which is consistent with the stance used during certain aerial tricks. The right foot, however, is not visibly raised but rather positioned near the middle of the board, possibly indicating a motion phase like a pop or flick. However, given the perspective and lighting, it's difficult to confirm if the right foot is fully off the board. In reality, during many skateboarding tricks, both feet remain in contact with the board, even in mid-air. Here, the right foot seems to be in close proximity but not clearly elevated. Thus, the description 'slightly raised' may be inaccurate. Based on the visual data and skateboarding mechanics, the right foot does not appear to be significantly lifted, so the statement is not fully supported.",

      "question": "Does the skater’s head and eyes look toward the right side of the frame, indicating forward momentum?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's head is turned slightly to his right (which corresponds to the right side of the image), and his gaze is directed forward and slightly to the right. This orientation aligns with the direction of movement, suggesting he is looking ahead toward his landing zone. In skateboarding, athletes typically focus on their trajectory to ensure proper timing and alignment upon landing. The angle of the head and eyes confirms forward momentum and intent. This matches real-world behavior during aerial stunts. Therefore, the visual cues support that the skater is looking toward the right side of the frame, consistent with forward motion.",

      "question": "Is the skater positioned above the surface of the ramp, indicating he is airborne?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skater in Image B is clearly elevated above the ramp structure. There is visible space between the skateboard and the ramp surface, and the background elements (like the graffiti-covered walls and railings) are below him, confirming his elevation. Additionally, the dynamic pose—crouched mid-air with no contact points on the ground—indicates he is in flight. In skateboarding, such positioning is characteristic of being airborne after launching off a ramp. This is further supported by the absence of any physical contact with the ramp. Hence, based on spatial positioning and context, the skater is indeed airborne.",

      "question": "Is there a second person, an older man in a dark jacket, visible in the background running across the ramp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the background of Image B, a figure can be seen running across the ramp area. This individual appears to be an older man, judging by his facial features and hairline. He is wearing a dark-colored jacket and pants, and his posture suggests movement across the ramp surface. This figure is consistent with the description provided in the question. While this character may have been present in the original image, the presence here is confirmed through direct observation. The setting—a skate park with ramps and urban elements—supports the plausibility of multiple individuals being present. Thus, the visual evidence supports the existence of this second person.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground features a large, curved ramp structure that forms a semi-circular or bowl-like shape. This design is typical of skate parks, especially those designed for vert skating or aerial tricks. The skater is positioned above this structure, which curves upward on both sides, creating a concave surface. The graffiti and architectural details reinforce that this is a skatepark bowl. The curvature is evident from the way the edges slope inward and upward, supporting the idea of a bowl-shaped feature. Therefore, based on the visual layout and common skatepark design, the presence of such a structure is confirmed.",
