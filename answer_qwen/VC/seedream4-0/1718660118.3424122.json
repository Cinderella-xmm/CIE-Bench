      "question": "Is the subject's face clearly showing the same facial structure as in the original image, including the long nose, high cheekbones, and symmetrical eye placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's face retains key facial features such as a long nose, high cheekbones, and symmetrical eye placement. These characteristics are consistent with the known historical appearance of George Washington, who is famously depicted with these traits in traditional portraits. The proportions of the face—such as the distance between the eyes, the bridge of the nose, and the jawline—are preserved, even though the lighting and artistic style have changed. The facial symmetry remains intact, with both eyes evenly spaced and aligned horizontally. This consistency suggests that despite the steampunk aesthetic modifications to the attire and chair, the core facial structure has been maintained faithfully. Comparing this to typical representations of Washington (e.g., Gilbert Stuart’s portrait), the facial features align closely, indicating that the artist prioritized preserving identity through facial recognition cues.",

      "question": "Does the subject retain the white powdered wig with voluminous curls framing the sides of the head, matching the original hairstyle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject wears a white wig with curled ends, similar in color and general shape to the powdered wigs common during the late 18th century. However, the style is not identical to the traditional, elaborate powdered wig seen in classical portraits like those of George Washington. Instead, it appears more stylized and simplified, with less volume and fewer curls than the original. While the wig maintains the white color and basic form, the lack of fullness and the slightly tighter curl pattern suggest a modified version rather than an exact match. In contrast, Image A shows a more historically accurate representation with greater volume and structured curls. Therefore, although the wig is present and appropriate for the era, it does not fully replicate the original hairstyle in detail.",

      "question": "Are both hands positioned on the armrests of the chair, with fingers relaxed and palms facing downward, mirroring the original posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands are indeed resting on the armrests of the chair. The fingers appear relaxed, and the palms are oriented downward, consistent with a formal seated pose. This positioning mirrors the posture seen in Image A, where the hands are similarly placed. The gesture conveys dignity and composure, which is typical of formal portraiture. The mechanical design of the chair in Image B does not alter the hand placement significantly; the hands remain in a natural, balanced position. The continuity in hand posture suggests intentional preservation of the original composition, even within the altered steampunk context.",

      "question": "Is the head and body oriented directly forward, with no lateral tilt or rotation, maintaining the original frontal view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s head and body are oriented directly forward, with no visible lateral tilt or rotational deviation. The shoulders are level, and the face is centered in the frame, facing the viewer straight on. This frontal alignment is consistent with traditional portraiture conventions, especially those used in official depictions of historical figures like George Washington. Even with the addition of mechanical elements and a complex steampunk chair, the figure maintains a symmetrical and direct pose. Comparing to Image A, the orientation is nearly identical—both images emphasize a dignified, front-facing stance. Thus, the frontal view has been preserved in the edited version.",

      "question": "Does the figure maintain the same proportionate body structure as in the original, with balanced head-to-body ratio and anatomically accurate limb lengths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure exhibits a proportionate body structure with a balanced head-to-body ratio. The limbs appear anatomically accurate in length and placement relative to the torso. Despite the addition of mechanical components—such as brass gears and armored elements—the underlying human form remains intact and correctly scaled. The arms, legs, and torso maintain realistic proportions, suggesting that the artist aimed to preserve the physical realism of the subject while integrating fantastical elements. Compared to Image A, where the proportions are classically rendered, Image B adheres to similar anatomical standards, albeit with stylistic enhancements. There is no evidence of distortion or exaggeration in limb length or body mass, indicating faithful adherence to the original proportions.",

      "question": "Is the light source still coming from the upper left, casting shadows on the right side of the face and clothing as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to originate from the upper left, consistent with the directional lighting in Image A. This is evident from the highlights on the left side of the face, the left shoulder, and the metallic surfaces of the chair and clothing. Shadows are cast toward the right side of the face and body, particularly under the chin and along the right cheek, which matches the lighting pattern in the original. The interplay of light and shadow on the gears and mechanical parts further supports this directionality. Although the materials in Image B (like copper and brass) reflect light differently than fabric, the overall lighting setup preserves the same visual logic. Therefore, the light source remains consistent with the original image.",

      "question": "Are the shoulders, arms, and facial features aligned symmetrically, with no noticeable imbalance in positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoulders are level, and the arms are symmetrically positioned on either side of the body. The facial features—eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth—are centrally aligned and evenly spaced, contributing to a balanced and harmonious composition. The symmetry is maintained despite the asymmetrical design of the steampunk chair, which includes various gears and pipes. The artist has carefully composed the figure so that the central axis remains stable, ensuring that the subject appears upright and dignified. Compared to Image A, the symmetry is preserved, though the added mechanical elements introduce visual complexity without disrupting the overall balance. Thus, the alignment remains symmetrical and well-proportioned.",
