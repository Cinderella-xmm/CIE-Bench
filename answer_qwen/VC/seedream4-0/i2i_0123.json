      "question": "Does the parking meter maintain its black cylindrical shape and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both parking meters retain their original black color and cylindrical shape. The design of the meters, including their rounded tops and vertical orientation, remains consistent with typical parking meters found in urban environments. There are no visible changes to the overall structure or coloration of either meter, despite the addition of a robotic dog interacting with the left meter. This suggests that the core physical characteristics of the meters have not been altered.",

      "question": "Is the coin slot visible on both parking meters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coin slot on the left parking meter is clearly visible, as it is being interacted with by a robotic dog holding a coin. The slot is located just above the keyhole at the bottom of the meter. On the right parking meter, the coin slot is also visible, positioned in the same location as on the left meter. Both slots appear to be intact and unobstructed, maintaining their standard placement and appearance. Therefore, the coin slots are visible on both meters.",

      "question": "Is the digital display on the right parking meter unchanged and labeled \"1995\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital display on the right parking meter in Image B shows the number '1995', which matches the label seen in the original image (Image A). The text around the display, such as 'Total time' and other smaller inscriptions, appears consistent with the original. There are no visual alterations to this display, indicating that it has remained unchanged. This consistency supports the conclusion that the digital display retains its original content and labeling.",

      "question": "Is the scene background, including the sidewalk, street, cars, and buildings, consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B includes a sidewalk, street, parked cars, and buildings that appear identical to those in Image A. The positioning of the cars, the lighting conditions, and the architectural details of the buildings remain unchanged. The perspective and depth of field suggest that the camera angle and environment have not been altered. Thus, the scene background is consistent with the original image, indicating no significant changes to the surrounding environment.",

      "question": "Are the numbers on the left meter (\"20487\") still present in some form, like being part of the robotic dog's design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The numbers '20487' are displayed on the left meter in Image B, specifically on the digital panel below the analog clock. These numbers are clearly visible and appear to be part of the meter's display, not integrated into the robotic dog’s design. The robotic dog, while interacting with the meter, does not incorporate or display these numbers. Therefore, the numbers remain on the meter itself and are not transferred or represented in the robotic dog’s structure.",
