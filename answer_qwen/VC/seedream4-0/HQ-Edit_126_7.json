      "question": "Is the wooden windowsill with visible grain and paneling along the lower edge present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windowsill is clearly visible beneath the cat. The surface shows a light-colored wood texture with distinct grain patterns running horizontally, consistent with natural wood. Along the lower edge of the windowsill, there are vertical paneling details that resemble traditional molding or decorative woodwork, which are typical in classic window designs. These features are consistent with real-world architectural elements used in interior design. Therefore, based on visual cues such as texture, grain, and structural paneling, the presence of a wooden windowsill with visible grain and paneling can be confirmed.",

      "question": "Are the sheer white curtains draped to the left side of the window visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left side of the window frame is occupied by a curtain made of a translucent, light-colored fabric—likely white or off-white—that drapes gracefully from the top of the window down to the sill. The material appears sheer, allowing some light to pass through while maintaining soft folds and creases, which are characteristic of lightweight curtain fabrics. This matches common household decor where sheer curtains are used for diffusing sunlight. The positioning and appearance confirm that these curtains are indeed draped to the left side of the window.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure of the window is partially visible behind the cat. There are vertical lines suggesting muntins or dividers between glass panes, which are typical in multi-pane windows. Although the cat's form obscures part of the view, the upper portion of the window reveals these vertical divisions, indicating segmented glass panes. Additionally, the reflection and clarity of the sky outside suggest transparent glass sections. This aligns with standard window construction where frames include both structural supports and glass panels. Thus, the window frame with vertical lines and glass panes is visually present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the view outside the window clearly shows a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The clouds have soft, rounded shapes and varying densities, typical of cumulus formations under fair weather conditions. The lighting suggests daytime, and the contrast between the sky and clouds indicates clear visibility. This external scene is consistent with a sunny day and is directly observable through the window, confirming that the blue sky with white clouds is indeed visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a textured, beige-colored knitted blanket is positioned under the cat’s head. The surface shows a consistent knit pattern with raised stitches, characteristic of hand-knitted or machine-knit fabrics. The blanket is folded at one end, creating a cushioned surface for the cat to rest upon. Its placement and fold are consistent with how blankets are typically arranged for comfort on a windowsill. Based on visual texture and arrangement, it is evident that the blanket is folded beneath the cat’s head.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, diagonal bands of light and shadow are visible across the wooden windowsill. These light patterns originate from the window and extend diagonally toward the lower right, casting sharp, parallel shadows that suggest direct sunlight entering at an angle. This effect is commonly seen when sunlight passes through window panes or blinds, creating striped illumination. The contrast between lit and shaded areas confirms the presence of both sunlight rays and their resulting shadows, which are consistent with natural daylight behavior.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted in a curled-up position, with its body forming a compact shape typical of sleeping animals. Its head is placed directly on the beige knitted blanket, which serves as a pillow-like support. The orientation of the cat’s body and the alignment of its head with the blanket indicate intentional rest. This posture is common in cats seeking warmth and comfort, especially in sunlit areas. The visual evidence confirms that the cat is curled up and has its head resting on the blanket.",
