      "question": "Does the edited image retain the vase's bulbous body, narrow neck, and flared rim?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object on the right that was originally a golden ornate vase in Image A has been transformed into a structure composed entirely of pink and white flowers. However, despite this transformation, the overall silhouette of the object retains the same general shape as the original vase: it has a bulbous middle section, a narrow neck, and a flared rim at the top. This suggests that while the material has changed from metal to flowers, the form and proportions have been preserved. This is consistent with artistic or digital editing techniques where the shape is maintained while the texture or content is altered. Therefore, based on visual analysis combined with understanding of form preservation in digital edits, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Are the flowers in the edited image still predominantly red with green leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bouquet on the left remains largely unchanged from Image A. It features vibrant red flowers with visible green leaves, consistent with the original composition. The red coloration of the petals and the presence of green foliage are clearly preserved. Although the second object (the vase) is now made of pink and white flowers, the primary floral arrangement in the smaller pot is still dominated by red blooms and green leaves. This indicates that the editing process did not alter the main flower bouquet. Thus, based on direct visual observation and comparison with typical floral arrangements, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Is the vase positioned next to the flower pot in the same manner as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the two objects—the flower pot on the left and the vase-like structure on the right—are placed side by side on a flat surface. Their relative positions remain consistent: the flower pot is to the left, and the taller vase-like object is to the right. The spacing between them appears similar, and their orientation (facing forward) is unchanged. Even though the vase in Image B is now made of flowers, its placement relative to the flower pot has not shifted. This suggests that the edit focused on transforming the vase’s appearance rather than altering its spatial relationship. Therefore, based on spatial consistency and object positioning, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the beige background?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears to be a uniform, neutral beige tone, similar to that in Image A. There are no visible changes in color, texture, or lighting that would suggest a different backdrop. The smooth, matte appearance and consistent shading across the wall behind the objects indicate that the background has been preserved. Since background elements are often kept constant in such edits to maintain visual coherence, and there is no evidence of alteration, it is reasonable to conclude that the beige background remains intact. Hence, the answer is yes.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface supporting both the flower pot and the flower-covered vase appears smooth and light in color, resembling marble or polished stone. The texture is consistent with the original image, showing subtle veining and a reflective quality typical of such materials. The lighting highlights the surface evenly, indicating no significant change in material or finish. Given that the surface has not been altered in terms of texture or hue, and remains visually continuous with the original, the answer is yes.",
