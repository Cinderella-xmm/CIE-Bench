    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes almond-shaped and positioned symmetrically on the face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character depicted is a stylized, cartoon-like figure with exaggerated features typical of 3D animated avatars. The eyes are large, round, and wide-set, which is common in such character designs to convey expressiveness. They are not almond-shaped, which is a more elongated, narrow shape often associated with human facial anatomy. Instead, these eyes are circular with prominent pupils and lashes, characteristic of cartoon aesthetics. Additionally, while they appear symmetrical in placement, their shape deviates significantly from an almond form. Therefore, based on visual analysis and knowledge of anatomical versus cartoon design standards, the eyes are not almond-shaped.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there small gold hoop earrings present in both ears?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon character has visible earlobes, and each ear displays a small, circular earring. These earrings are gold in color and have a hoop design, consistent with the description of 'small gold hoop earrings.' This matches the style seen in Image A, where the real person also wears similar earrings. However, in Image B, the earrings are part of a stylized representation—slightly larger relative to the face but still recognizable as hoops. Given that both ears have identical earrings, and their appearance aligns with the described attributes, the answer is affirmative.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the right hand placed inside the front pocket of the trousers with fingers visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon character's right hand is shown inserted into the front pocket of green shorts (not trousers), and the fingers are partially visible, extending slightly from the pocket opening. This is consistent with the pose commonly used in fashion illustrations or avatars to suggest casual confidence. While the original image (Image A) shows a real person with her hand in the pocket of high-waisted trousers, the edited version uses shorts instead. Despite this difference in clothing type, the hand placement and visibility of fingers remain consistent with the question’s description. Thus, the action described is accurately represented.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the hair have a natural, wavy curl pattern falling over the shoulders?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s hair is styled with long, dark curls that cascade over the shoulders. The curls are voluminous and follow a spiral pattern, resembling natural waves or soft curls. Although the rendering is stylized and cartoonish, the overall structure mimics a natural wavy texture. This is consistent with the hairstyle seen in Image A, where the real person also has curly hair falling over the shoulders. The visual cues—such as the flow, volume, and direction of the curls—support the interpretation that the hair has a wavy curl pattern, even if exaggerated for artistic effect. Therefore, based on both visual observation and understanding of hair styling conventions, the answer is yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the head slightly tilted forward toward the camera?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon character’s head is positioned upright and facing directly forward, with no noticeable tilt. The angle of the head is neutral, maintaining alignment with the body and the camera perspective. In contrast, Image A shows a real person whose head is subtly tilted forward, creating a more engaging and personal expression. However, in Image B, the avatar maintains a straight posture without any forward tilt. Based on this comparison and standard principles of pose and framing in digital avatars, the head is not tilted forward.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q6: Does the blouse have a V-neckline with visible buttons running down the center?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blouse worn by the cartoon character clearly features a V-neckline, which opens at the chest and tapers downward. Along the center front, there are visible buttons arranged vertically, matching the design of the blouse in Image A. This detail is consistent across both images, indicating that the blouse retains its key design elements in the stylized version. The presence of both the V-neck and central buttons confirms that the garment matches the description. Even though the rendering is simplified, the structural features are preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the trousers have a high waist with a visible waistband seam and belt loops?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is wearing green shorts, not trousers. These shorts have a high waist and a visible waistband seam, which is consistent with the high-waisted design seen in Image A. However, unlike the trousers in Image A, the shorts do not show belt loops, and the waistband appears simpler. While the waist height and seam are present, the absence of belt loops means the full feature set described in the question is not fully met. Therefore, although some aspects match, the complete description—including belt loops—is not satisfied.",
    "answer": "No"
