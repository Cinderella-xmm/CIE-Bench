      "question": "Does the edited image contain exactly four suitcases?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are four distinct luggage items stacked vertically. From bottom to top: a large rectangular suitcase, a smaller rectangular one, a round case, and a duffel-style bag on top. Each of these has unique shape and size characteristics that distinguish them as separate suitcases. The presence of faces drawn on each suitcase suggests they are anthropomorphized, but this does not change their count or classification as individual suitcases. Therefore, based on visual inspection and common understanding of what constitutes a suitcase (a portable container for clothes or belongings), there are indeed four suitcases in the stack.",

      "question": "Are the suitcases stacked in the same order from bottom to top: two rectangular, one round, one duffel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the stack in Image B: the bottom suitcase is rectangular, the second is also rectangular (smaller than the first), the third is clearly round (circular in cross-section), and the fourth on top is a duffel bag (soft-sided, rounded shape). This matches the described order: two rectangular, then one round, then one duffel. Comparing with Image A, the stacking order is identical in terms of shapes, though Image A lacks facial features. The consistency in shape sequence across both images confirms the order is preserved. Thus, the arrangement matches the specified pattern.",

      "question": "Is the third suitcase from the bottom clearly round in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third suitcase from the bottom is circular in form, resembling a vintage hatbox or musical instrument case. Its sides are curved, and it has no sharp corners, distinguishing it from the rectangular cases above and below. This round shape is consistent with traditional round luggage used historically. Even though it has cartoonish facial features added, its physical form remains clearly round. In contrast, Image A shows the same object without facial features, confirming its original shape. Therefore, the third suitcase is unambiguously round.",

      "question": "Is the figure positioned to the right of the luggage stack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human-like figure stands on the right side of the display case, while the stack of suitcases is on the left side within the same case. The spatial layout places the figure distinctly to the right of the luggage stack. This positioning is consistent with the composition of the scene, where the figure appears to be observing or accompanying the luggage. In Image A, the person is also to the right of the luggage stack, indicating that this relative positioning was maintained during editing. Hence, the figure is indeed to the right of the stack.",

      "question": "Is the figure depicted in side profile, facing left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is shown in a clear side profile view, with its body oriented toward the left of the frame. The face is turned to the left, and the posture—arms at sides, head slightly angled—confirms it is facing left. This is typical of a side-profile pose commonly used in dioramas or displays. Comparing with Image A, the original figure also faces left in side profile. The edit preserves this orientation, even though the figure's appearance has been stylized into a doll-like form. Thus, the figure is depicted in side profile, facing left.",

      "question": "Do the suitcases rest directly on top of one another in a stable vertical stack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each suitcase is placed directly on the one beneath it, forming a vertical column. There is no visible gap or support structure between them; they appear to be balanced one atop the other. Although the top duffel bag leans slightly forward, it still rests on the round case below, maintaining contact. The stack appears stable despite the slight tilt, which could be due to artistic styling rather than instability. In Image A, the same stacking configuration exists, suggesting the physical arrangement is preserved. Therefore, the suitcases do rest directly on top of one another in a vertical stack.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a single human-like figure—a stylized male figure in a trench coat and hat—standing inside a glass display case. No other human figures are visible. While the suitcases have faces drawn on them, these are anthropomorphic elements and not actual human figures. They are objects with cartoon features, not sentient beings. In Image A, there is also only one human figure, the man in black attire. The edit transforms the person into a figurine but retains the singular nature of the subject. Therefore, there is exactly one human figure in the image.",
