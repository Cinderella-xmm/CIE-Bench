    "Question": "Q1: Is the light blue botanical pattern (leaf and vine motifs) present on the bedding in the LEGO version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bedding is constructed from LEGO bricks. The top surface of the blanket and pillows is made of light blue LEGO pieces arranged in a grid-like pattern. However, these pieces are uniform in color and lack any detailed patterns such as leaves or vines. Unlike real fabric where intricate designs can be printed or woven, LEGO bricks do not support fine detail like botanical motifs. Therefore, the light blue botanical pattern seen in the original image (Image A) is absent in the LEGO version. The design is simplified to basic color blocks due to the physical limitations of LEGO construction.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the bedding and bed frame rendered in white with light blue accents in the LEGO version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bed frame is primarily constructed from white LEGO bricks, which aligns with the white color scheme of the original bed. The mattress area uses white bricks for the base layer, while the top layer of the blanket and the pillow sections use light blue LEGO bricks. This creates a clear visual contrast between the white structure and the light blue accents. This matches the color scheme of the original image, where the bedding features white fabric with light blue patterns. Thus, the LEGO version maintains the white base with light blue highlights, consistent with the originalâ€™s aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are there exactly two pillows stacked vertically on the left side of the bed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pillow area on the left side of the bed is built using light blue LEGO bricks arranged in a blocky, layered structure. Visually, there are two distinct horizontal layers of bricks forming the pillows, stacked one on top of the other. While they are not perfectly smooth like real pillows, their arrangement clearly indicates two separate stacks. This corresponds to the two pillows seen in the original image (Image A), suggesting that the LEGO model accurately represents the number and stacking of pillows. The vertical alignment and separation of the layers confirm this interpretation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the blanket folded and positioned on the right half of the bed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blanket section is composed of light blue LEGO bricks covering the right portion of the bed. The edge of the blanket appears to be folded over, as indicated by the visible layering of bricks at the edge, creating a slight overlap. This mimics the fold seen in the original image (Image A), where the blanket is neatly folded and placed on the right side. The LEGO construction replicates this placement and folding effect, even though it is stylized due to the modular nature of the bricks. Therefore, the blanket is indeed folded and located on the right half of the bed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the background a uniform neutral gray with no additional textures or elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the bed is a flat, consistent shade of neutral gray. There are no visible textures, gradients, or additional objects such as wall art or furniture. The lighting is even, and the surface appears smooth, suggesting a studio-like setting designed to emphasize the subject. This matches the background in Image A, which also features a plain gray backdrop. Since both images share the same minimalist environment, the background in the LEGO version is indeed uniform and free of distractions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the dark brown rectangular object visible in the upper right corner of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a small dark brown rectangular object is visible in the upper right corner of the frame. It appears to be a partial view of a shelf or another piece of furniture, similar to what is seen in Image A. Its position and shape are consistent across both images, indicating it is part of the scene's composition. Although it is not central to the focus, its presence is confirmed by visual inspection. This suggests continuity in the environment between the original and LEGO versions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the bed positioned horizontally and centered within the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bed is oriented horizontally, stretching from the left to the right side of the image. Its placement is symmetrical relative to the frame, with equal amounts of space on either side. The centerline of the bed aligns closely with the center of the image, indicating intentional centering. This positioning mirrors the original image (Image A), where the bed is similarly centered. The consistent framing and symmetry suggest that the LEGO version maintains the same compositional balance as the original.",
    "answer": "Yes"
