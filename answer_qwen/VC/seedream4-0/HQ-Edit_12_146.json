      "question": "Is the facial structure including the eyes, nose, beard, and smile preserved exactly as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial structure of the subject—specifically the eyes, nose, beard, and smile—is visually consistent with the original image (Image A). The shape and positioning of the eyes are symmetrical and aligned, the nose maintains its bridge and tip proportions, the beard is neatly trimmed and shaped similarly, and the smile reveals a full set of teeth in a natural arc. These features suggest that the core facial anatomy has been preserved without distortion. However, while the overall structure appears identical, subtle differences in lighting or digital enhancement could slightly alter perceived texture or shadowing. Nonetheless, based on visual comparison and common knowledge about facial symmetry and identity preservation in edited portraits, the facial structure is effectively preserved. The consistency across both images supports this conclusion.",

      "question": "Are the blue and green floral henna designs on the cheeks present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's cheeks display intricate henna-like designs. These designs are predominantly blue and green with floral patterns, consistent with traditional henna art. Upon close inspection, the placement and style of these designs match those seen in Image A. The design on the left cheek (viewer’s right) includes a leafy motif, while the right cheek (viewer’s left) shows a smaller, complementary pattern. There are no visible alterations in color, shape, or position between the two images. Given that henna designs are typically static unless intentionally modified, and since there is no indication of change in coloration or form, it can be concluded that the designs remain unchanged. This consistency aligns with typical digital editing practices where such artistic elements are preserved for aesthetic continuity.",

      "question": "Are the small gold earrings visible in both ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both ears of the subject are visible, and each ear displays a small earring. The earrings appear to be gold in color and have a simple, circular design, consistent with traditional or cultural jewelry styles. In Image A, similar earrings are also present in both ears. The size, shape, and placement of the earrings are nearly identical in both images. Based on the visual evidence and general knowledge about jewelry representation in portraiture, where accessories are often retained unless explicitly removed, it is reasonable to conclude that the earrings are still present and unchanged. No signs of digital removal or alteration are evident in either image.",

      "question": "Is the peacock feather held in the right hand present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s right hand is clearly visible and positioned near the chest. Held within the fingers is a single peacock feather, identifiable by its iridescent blue-green eye and dark barbs. This feather matches the one seen in Image A. The presence of the feather is consistent with the subject’s pose and attire, which includes other peacock feathers in the crown. Since the feather is physically held and not obscured, and given that no editing artifacts suggest its removal or replacement, it can be confirmed that the peacock feather is indeed present in the right hand. This detail reinforces the thematic continuity between the two images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s right hand is placed close to the chest area, with fingers gently curled around the stem of the peacock feather. This positioning is deliberate and symmetrical with the overall composition of the portrait. The hand is elevated and centered, drawing attention to the feather and the detailed henna work on the skin. Comparing this to Image A, the same hand position is observed, indicating that the pose has been preserved. Given that hand placement is a key compositional element in such portraits and would likely be maintained in edits for aesthetic balance, the positioning remains unchanged. Therefore, the right hand is indeed near the chest, holding the feather.",

      "question": "Is the subject looking upward and toward the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s gaze is directed upward and slightly to the left side of the frame (from the viewer’s perspective). The eyes are angled upwards, with the pupils clearly shifted toward the upper-left quadrant. This gaze direction is consistent with Image A, where the same upward-left orientation is observed. Such a pose is often used in regal or dramatic portraiture to convey nobility, contemplation, or divine connection. The alignment of the head and eyes confirms that the subject is looking in the specified direction. There is no indication of repositioning or digital manipulation altering the gaze, so the original direction of the look is preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s skin tone appears warm and even, with a smooth texture that reflects natural lighting. The skin shows subtle variations in shading due to facial contours, but no artificial smoothing or color correction distortions are evident. The pores, slight shadows under the jawline, and highlights on the forehead suggest realistic skin rendering. Compared to Image A, the skin tone and texture are remarkably consistent—no noticeable changes in hue, brightness, or surface detail. Digital editing tools may enhance clarity or contrast, but in this case, the natural appearance is maintained. This preservation is important for maintaining authenticity in portraits, especially when cultural or artistic elements are prominent. Thus, the natural skin tone and texture are preserved.",
