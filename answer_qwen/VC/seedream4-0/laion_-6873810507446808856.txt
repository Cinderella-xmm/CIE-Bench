    "Question": "Q1: Are there two vertically stacked pancake layers, with the bottom one slightly larger than the top?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top panel shows a stack of pancakes that appears to consist of multiple layers, not just two. The stack is composed of at least three distinct pancakes, and they are all roughly the same size, with no clear indication that the bottom pancake is significantly larger than the top one. This contrasts with typical real-world pancake stacks where slight variations in size might occur, but here the visual evidence does not support the claim of two layers with the bottom being larger. Therefore, based on visual analysis, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the pancakes retain a dominant golden-yellow color throughout their visible surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pancakes are depicted in an animated style, and their surfaces are rendered with a consistent golden-yellow hue, especially noticeable in the top panel. The coloration is uniform across the visible surfaces of the pancakes, including the sides and tops, which aligns with the typical appearance of cooked pancakes. Although the cartoon style may exaggerate colors slightly, the dominant golden-yellow tone is maintained. Thus, the answer is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a solid, rectangular pat of pale yellow butter placed on the top pancake?",
    "explanation": "In the top panel of Image B, a solid, rectangular block of pale yellow butter is clearly visible on top of the pancake stack. It matches the typical appearance of a pat of butter before melting, with clean edges and a consistent color. This detail is consistent with common breakfast presentations and aligns with the visual cues in the image. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a visible stream of amber-colored syrup flowing from a pitcher onto the pancakes?",
    "explanation": "In the top panel of Image B, a stream of amber-colored syrup can be seen flowing from a pitcher above the pancake stack. The syrup is depicted as pouring down onto the pancakes, creating a realistic visual effect of liquid flow. This is consistent with the act of drizzling syrup over pancakes, a common breakfast ritual. Hence, the answer is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the pancake stack placed on a white plate with a light blue rim?",
    "explanation": "In the top panel of Image B, the pancake stack is indeed placed on a plate that is predominantly white with a thin, light blue rim around the edge. This detail is clearly visible and matches the description. The plate's design is consistent with common dinnerware used for serving breakfast items. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the inner sides of the pancakes visibly porous and airy, showing a spongy texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pancakes are stylized cartoon characters rather than realistic depictions. While the outer surfaces show some texture, the inner sides of the pancakes are not clearly visible or detailed enough to confirm porosity or sponginess. In contrast, real pancakes often have a porous interior, but this image prioritizes character design over anatomical accuracy. Since the internal texture is not visibly detailed, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the syrup stream originate from above the stack and flow downward onto the top pancake?",
    "explanation": "In the top panel of Image B, the syrup is shown being poured from a pitcher positioned above the pancake stack. The stream flows directly downward, landing on the top pancake and cascading down the sides. This is consistent with the physics of pouring liquids and matches typical syrup application methods. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"
