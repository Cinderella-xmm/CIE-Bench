      "question": "Is the kite depicted in the shape of a diamond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite is clearly visible and has a symmetrical four-sided structure with pointed corners, forming a classic diamond shape. This is consistent with common representations of traditional kites, especially those used in cultural or festive contexts. The kite's geometric form, with equal-length sides converging at sharp angles, aligns perfectly with the definition of a diamond shape. The visual cues—such as the diagonal lines forming an 'X' pattern across the kite’s surface—further confirm this interpretation. There is no distortion or deformation that would suggest otherwise.",

      "question": "Does the kite retain its bright yellow color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite in Image B is distinctly bright yellow, matching the hue seen in typical kite designs meant to stand out against the sky. The color is consistent across the entire surface of the kite, including the tail, which maintains the same yellow tone. Even under the lighting conditions (with sunlight casting subtle highlights), the yellow remains vivid and unaltered. This suggests that the kite’s color has been preserved without fading or modification. The surrounding decorative elements (like red paper lanterns) contrast sharply with the yellow, further emphasizing its brightness.",

      "question": "Are two strings visibly attached to the kite?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, two thin white strings can be observed extending from the bottom of the kite. These strings are visible against the blue sky background and appear to trail downward, suggesting they are part of the kite’s flying mechanism. In real-world kite flying, multiple strings are often used for control and stability. The presence of two distinct lines, one slightly longer than the other, supports the idea that both are functional and not just decorative. While some kites use only one string, the dual-string configuration here is plausible and visually confirmed.",

      "question": "Does the kite appear to be flying against a clear sky background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background behind the kite in Image B shows a predominantly clear blue sky with scattered white clouds, indicating fair weather conditions suitable for kite flying. Although there are decorative elements like paper cutouts and lanterns framing the image, these are layered in front of the sky scene and do not obscure the actual sky backdrop. The sky itself appears unobstructed by pollution, birds, or other objects, reinforcing the impression of a clear day. Therefore, despite the artistic framing, the kite is indeed set against a clear sky.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the kite in Image B has a long, flowing yellow tail attached to its lower end. The tail is made of the same yellow material as the kite body and extends downward in a curved fashion, consistent with how tails behave in wind. Tails on kites serve to stabilize flight and add visual appeal. The continuity of color and material between the kite and the tail confirms it is an integral part of the design. Even though the tail is partially obscured by the frame’s decorations, its presence is unmistakable within the central image area.",
