      "question": "Is the cheetah face graphic present on the right sleeve of the subject's top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted in a stylized relief carving reminiscent of ancient Egyptian art. The figure wears a garment with leopard print sleeves, but there is no visible cheetah face graphic on the right sleeve. Instead, the design appears to be a consistent leopard print pattern without any distinct animal face motif. This contrasts with typical modern fashion designs where such graphics might be prominent. Based on visual analysis and understanding of artistic representation in relief sculptures, which often emphasize patterns over detailed illustrations, it is clear that the cheetah face is not present.",

      "question": "Are both boxing gloves rendered in gold color with visible yellow laces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands are depicted as golden boxing gloves, consistent with the overall golden accents in the artwork (such as the crown and bracelets). However, upon close inspection, while both gloves appear golden, the yellow laces are not clearly visible. In fact, the rendering style of the relief does not include fine details like laces, which are typically absent in such sculptural representations due to their flat, carved nature. Thus, although the gloves are gold, the presence of yellow laces cannot be confirmed due to the artistic medium and lack of detail.",

      "question": "Is the leopard print pattern present on the sleeves and headscarf of the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's sleeves are clearly adorned with a leopard print pattern, matching the aesthetic of the garment. Additionally, the headscarf or headdress features a similar spotted pattern, though it is less distinct due to the stylization of the relief. Given that the entire composition uses consistent motifs—especially in the clothing—the leopard print can be reasonably inferred to extend to the headscarf as well. This aligns with common artistic conventions where patterns are repeated across garments for visual harmony. Therefore, the leopard print is present on both the sleeves and headscarf.",

      "question": "Is the headscarf worn by the subject red and black with a leopard print pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headscarf appears to be primarily dark blue or black with gold and light-colored stripes, resembling traditional Egyptian headdresses rather than a red and black leopard print. While there is a leopard print pattern on the sleeves, the headscarf itself does not display red tones or a leopard print design. The colors and patterns are more aligned with ancient Egyptian iconography, including striped elements and symbolic adornments. Thus, the description of a red and black leopard print headscarf is inaccurate based on the visual evidence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes stylized green palm fronds, which are integrated into the frame surrounding the figure. These fronds are part of the decorative border and appear to be painted or carved into the stone-like surface. Their presence is consistent with Egyptian artistic motifs, where natural elements like palm trees symbolize life and fertility. The fronds are clearly visible and contribute to the thematic setting of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the framing is not white or composed of overlapping rectangles. Instead, the border is made of carved stone with hieroglyphic-like symbols and a rectangular outline that mimics ancient Egyptian wall reliefs. The border is beige or tan in color, matching the stone texture, and lacks any white or modern geometric overlay. Therefore, the description of a white geometric border is incorrect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s facial features are rendered in a classical Egyptian artistic style. The eyes are outlined with black kohl, typical of ancient Egyptian makeup, but there is no visible teal eyeshadow. The lips are painted in a subtle reddish tone, but it is not as vivid or bright as 'bright red lipstick' would suggest. The coloration is muted and consistent with historical depictions, not modern cosmetics. Therefore, the presence of teal eyeshadow and bright red lipstick is not accurate.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's right arm is raised, not the left. The raised arm is wearing a gold boxing glove, which is consistent with the overall theme of golden accessories. The left arm is lowered and also ends in a gold boxing glove, but it is not raised. This positioning is important for determining which arm is elevated. Based on anatomical orientation and the direction of the arm, the raised arm is the right one, not the left.",
