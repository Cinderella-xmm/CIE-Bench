      "question": "Is the faceted star-shaped pattern covering the body of the perfume bottle preserved in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the perfume bottle is constructed from Lego bricks, and while it maintains a geometric, faceted appearance, the specific star-shaped pattern seen in the original glass bottle is not replicated with precision. Instead, the surface is composed of flat, rectangular Lego pieces that mimic the general texture but lack the intricate, repeating star-like facets. The Lego construction prioritizes structural integrity and modular design over fine detail replication. Therefore, although the overall impression of a faceted surface is retained, the exact star-shaped pattern is not preserved.",

      "question": "Does the perfume bottle maintain its cylindrical shape with tapered sides and flat base in the Lego construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Lego version of the bottle in Image B retains a generally cylindrical form, with a slight tapering toward the top, consistent with the original bottle's silhouette. However, due to the blocky nature of Lego bricks, the smooth curves and gradual tapering are approximated using stacked layers. The base appears flat, as required, but the transition from base to neck is less fluid than in the original. While the overall shape is preserved in a stylized manner, the smoothness and precision of the original’s cylindrical form are compromised by the modular construction. Thus, the shape is maintained in a simplified, blocky interpretation.",

      "question": "Is the gold faceted spherical cap positioned at the top of the bottle preserved in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the bottle features a gold-colored Lego structure that mimics the faceted spherical cap of the original. The cap is made of interlocking Lego pieces arranged to resemble the multi-faceted geometry of the original. While the material and method of construction differ, the visual form — a faceted sphere atop the bottle — is clearly preserved. The golden color and angular facets are accurately represented within the constraints of Lego design. This suggests a faithful reproduction of the cap’s shape and placement.",

      "question": "Is the spray nozzle located on the side of the bottle’s neck, with a visible mist plume extending diagonally outward, preserved in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small black circular element resembling a nozzle is visible on the side of the bottle’s neck, similar to the original. A mist plume extends diagonally from this point, just as in the original image. The plume is rendered in a way that matches the original’s direction and dispersion, suggesting continuity in the depiction of action. Although the nozzle itself is stylized and simplified (as expected with Lego), its position and function are preserved. The visual effect of spraying is also maintained, indicating that both the location and the dynamic element are faithfully recreated.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric background is replaced with Lego bricks arranged in a wavy pattern to simulate folds. While the general undulating shape is present, the texture and depth of the original silk-like fabric are lost. The Lego bricks create a more rigid, structured representation of folds, lacking the softness and natural flow of the original. Moreover, the positioning of the folds differs slightly due to the modular nature of Lego construction. Thus, while the concept of folds is preserved, their form and exact position are not accurately replicated.",

      "question": "Is the perfume bottle positioned directly on top of the fabric background, maintaining contact and alignment with the folds, in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Lego bottle sits on a platform made of Lego bricks that mimic the fabric folds. However, the bottle is placed on a flat Lego base rather than directly on the undulating fabric-like surface. The Lego 'fabric' is built around and beneath the base, meaning the bottle does not make direct contact with the folds themselves. In contrast, in the original image, the bottle rests directly on the fabric, conforming to its contours. Therefore, the physical relationship between the bottle and the background surface is altered in the Lego version.",

      "question": "Is the size of the gold cap proportionally consistent with the body of the bottle in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold cap appears to be proportionally similar to the body of the bottle, maintaining the same relative scale as in the original. Despite being constructed from Lego pieces, the cap’s height and width are consistent with the dimensions of the bottle’s neck and body. The use of appropriately sized Lego elements ensures that the cap does not appear oversized or undersized. This suggests that the designer paid attention to proportional accuracy, even within the constraints of modular building blocks.",
