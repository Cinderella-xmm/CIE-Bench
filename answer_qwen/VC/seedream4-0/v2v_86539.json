      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the potato character is consistently depicted across all three panels with a rounded, irregular shape characteristic of a potato. The surface texture includes small dark spots resembling natural blemishes or eyes on a real potato, which reinforces the potato-like appearance. Additionally, the character's overall form remains consistent with that of a potato—bulbous and slightly asymmetrical—despite anthropomorphic features such as limbs and facial expressions. These visual cues, combined with common knowledge about how potatoes look in real life and how they are stylized in cartoon form, confirm that the character retains its potato-like shape and texture throughout the image.",

      "question": "Is the potato character in the first panel still depicted as exercising with dumbbells and wearing a green headband?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the first panel of Image B, the potato character is shown in a gym setting, walking toward the viewer with a cheerful expression. It is wearing a green headband, which matches the description. However, it is not lifting dumbbells; instead, it appears to be jogging or walking in place. The dumbbells are present in the background on a rack but are not being used by the character. Based on this observation, while the character is in an exercise environment and wears the headband, it is not actively using dumbbells. Therefore, the depiction does not fully align with the original action of exercising with dumbbells.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second panel of Image B, the potato character is clearly shown lying inside a cardboard box. The box has been modified to resemble a bed, with a pillow and blanket visible beneath the character. The potato’s eyes are closed, and its posture suggests rest or sleep. This setup is consistent with the idea of sleeping in a makeshift bed, which aligns with the concept of a potato character resting in a box. Given that cardboard boxes are often associated with makeshift shelters or temporary beds in cartoons (especially for animals or quirky characters), this scene logically indicates sleep. The visual cues—closed eyes, relaxed body, and bedding—support this interpretation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the third panel of Image B, the potato character is depicted sitting at a small round table with various food-related items: a bowl with a spoon, a cup, and what appears to be a phone or remote control. The character has a content expression and is holding a spoon near its mouth, suggesting the act of eating. Although the food items are simplified, they are recognizable as typical dining elements. The context of a seated figure at a table with utensils and food strongly implies eating behavior. This is consistent with the common narrative trope of characters engaging in meals at tables. Thus, the scene effectively communicates the activity of eating.",

      "question": "Are all three panels distinctly showing the activities of exercising, sleeping, and eating respectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The three panels in Image B each depict a different activity. The first panel shows the potato character in a gym environment, wearing athletic attire (green headband) and appearing to be engaged in physical activity, though not lifting dumbbells. This can reasonably be interpreted as exercising, even if the specific action differs from lifting weights. The second panel clearly shows the character asleep in a cardboard box with bedding, indicating sleeping. The third panel shows the character seated at a table with food and utensils, actively eating. While the first panel’s exercise depiction is less precise than expected (e.g., no dumbbell use), the overall theme of physical activity is still conveyed through the setting and character’s posture. Therefore, despite minor deviations, each panel distinctly represents one of the three activities: exercising, sleeping, and eating.",
