      "question": "Are there exactly four rotor assemblies arranged symmetrically around the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drone is depicted with four rotor assemblies, one at each corner of its central body. Each rotor consists of a motor and two propellers, which are clearly visible. The arrangement appears to be symmetrical, with each rotor positioned equidistant from the center and aligned along the cardinal axes (front, back, left, right). This configuration is typical for quadcopters, where symmetry ensures balanced flight dynamics. The visual cues confirm that there are exactly four rotors, and their placement is evenly distributed around the central body, consistent with standard quadcopter design principles.",

      "question": "Are there yellow triangular markings present on the top and side surfaces of the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the central body of the drone features several yellow triangular markings. These markings are visible on both the top surface and the sides of the drone's main frame. They appear as stylized accents, possibly serving as design elements or branding indicators. The yellow color contrasts sharply with the black body, making them prominent. This matches common aesthetic practices in drone design, where accent colors are used for visual appeal or identification. The presence of these markings is confirmed by direct observation of the image.",

      "question": "Are the landing supports shaped like V-forms at each corner of the drone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landing supports are not shaped like V-forms. Instead, they resemble articulated mechanical legs with multiple joints and segments, ending in small wheels or pads. These supports extend downward from each corner of the droneâ€™s body but do not form a simple V-shape. Rather, they have a more complex, spider-like structure, suggesting advanced mobility or stability features. This design is more elaborate than typical V-shaped landing gear, indicating a futuristic or specialized purpose. Therefore, the landing supports do not match the description of V-forms.",

      "question": "Does the central body feature sharp, angular edges and a polygonal structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central body of the drone in Image B exhibits a highly angular and geometric design. It has sharp edges, flat planes, and a polygonal shape, resembling a futuristic or armored structure. This is evident from the way light reflects off its surfaces, highlighting facets and corners. Such a design is often used in sci-fi aesthetics to convey strength, speed, or technological sophistication. Compared to conventional drones, which tend to have smoother, rounded bodies, this drone's central body is distinctly polygonal and angular, aligning with the visual language of advanced robotics or military-grade equipment.",

      "question": "Are there three small rectangular lights aligned horizontally on the top surface of the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the top surface of the central body in Image B, there is no visible alignment of three small rectangular lights. Instead, the top surface features a sleek, dark panel with glowing orange-yellow eyes or sensors near the front, which resemble headlights or optical sensors. There are no distinct rectangular lights arranged horizontally. While some illuminated elements exist, they do not match the specific description of three small, horizontally aligned rectangular lights. This absence can be confirmed by examining the top portion of the drone's body in detail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drone in Image B is primarily black, with various yellow accents visible on the central body, including triangular patterns and highlights along structural lines. These yellow markings serve as visual accents, contrasting against the dark base color. This color scheme is common in high-tech or military-inspired designs, where black conveys stealth or durability, and yellow adds visibility or branding. The combination of black and yellow is consistent throughout the drone, confirming that it is predominantly black with yellow accent markings.",
