      "question": "Is the red headband visible on the mother’s head, positioned across her forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mother's head is clearly depicted with a distinct red band wrapped horizontally across her forehead. This headband is consistent in color and placement with typical Neoclassical portraiture elements seen in historical paintings, where such accessories were used to emphasize elegance or status. The red color contrasts sharply with her dark curly hair and pale skin, making it highly visible. Based on visual analysis, the headband is present and correctly positioned. There is no ambiguity in its visibility or location.",

      "question": "Does the child wear a blue dress with short sleeves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child is shown wearing a dress that is predominantly blue in color. The sleeves are visibly short, ending just above the elbow, which is consistent with the fashion of the late 18th to early 19th century often depicted in classical portraits. The fabric appears smooth and drapes naturally, suggesting a lightweight material appropriate for a child’s attire. The sleeve length and color are clearly discernible, and there are no indications of long sleeves or different coloring.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a red sash is clearly visible around the mother’s waist, tied in a flowing manner. The sash has decorative fringes at the ends, which hang down over her white dress and greenish-gold fabric. These fringes are detailed and add texture to the composition. Such embellishments are common in classical portraiture to denote status or emotional depth. The sash is not merely a plain strip but includes ornamental details that confirm its presence and design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a fabric with a greenish-gold hue is draped over the mother’s lap, partially covering her legs. The fabric has a soft sheen and folds that suggest a silky or satin-like material. Its placement and color contrast with the white dress and red sash, drawing attention to the lower half of the composition. This element is consistent with the luxurious materials often used in formal portraiture to convey richness or nobility.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child’s arms are clearly raised and encircling the mother’s neck, indicating an embrace. The mother’s arms are positioned around the child’s back, holding her securely. This mutual embrace is central to the emotional tone of the image, conveying affection and protection. The positioning of the limbs is anatomically accurate and consistent with a close physical bond. The overlap of arms and bodies confirms the described interaction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mother’s gaze is directed forward, toward the viewer. Her eyes are open and focused, with a calm and serene expression. This direct engagement is a common technique in portraiture to create a sense of connection between the subject and the observer. The angle of her head and the alignment of her eyes confirm that she is looking straight ahead, not downward or sideways.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child’s head is tilted slightly upward, and her eyes are directed toward the mother’s face. This upward gaze suggests dependence, affection, or admiration. The positioning of the child’s head and facial orientation supports this interpretation. In classical art, such gestures are often used to express innocence and emotional attachment. The direction of the gaze is clear and unambiguous.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the mother and the child have voluminous, dark, curly hair. The mother’s hair is styled in loose curls that frame her face, while the child’s hair is similarly curly and flows down her back. The texture and color are consistent across both figures, suggesting a shared familial trait. Dark curly hair was common in European portraiture of the period, especially in depictions of noble or idealized families. The visual evidence strongly supports that both individuals have curly dark hair.",

      "question": "Is the lighting coming from the upper left, casting soft shadows on the right side of the figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light source appears to originate from the upper left, as indicated by the highlights on the left sides of the faces, shoulders, and arms of both figures. Soft shadows are cast on the right sides of their bodies, particularly noticeable on the mother’s right cheek and the child’s right shoulder. This directional lighting creates depth and volume, a hallmark of classical painting techniques. The gradual transition from light to shadow suggests a soft, diffused light source, consistent with studio lighting used in traditional portraiture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the folds and drapery of both the white dress worn by the mother and the blue dress worn by the child are intricately detailed. The white dress shows natural creases and soft cascades, suggesting fabric movement and weight. Similarly, the blue dress displays realistic folds, especially around the sleeves and skirt, indicating careful rendering of textile physics. These details are consistent with high-quality oil painting techniques used in classical art, where accurate depiction of fabric was essential for realism. The clarity and precision of the drapery suggest skilled artistic execution.",
