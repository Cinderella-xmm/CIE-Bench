      "question": "Does the illustration retain the man's original face shape and glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrated character is depicted in a stylized, cartoon-like manner. Despite the artistic exaggeration, the basic facial structure—such as the prominent forehead, receding hairline, and overall oval face shape—is preserved. The glasses are also clearly present, with the same general rectangular frame style seen in the original photo. While the illustration simplifies features, it maintains recognizable proportions and key elements like the glasses, which are central to the man’s appearance. This suggests that the artist prioritized retaining identifiable traits even within a dynamic, exaggerated pose.",

      "question": "Is the pattern on the tie retained in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tie is shown with a distinct geometric or possibly floral-like pattern composed of repeating shapes. This pattern is visible and consistent with the original design seen in Image A, where the tie has a detailed, symmetrical motif. In the illustration, although rendered in a simplified black-and-white line art style, the pattern is still discernible and matches the original’s complexity and layout. The artist has maintained the essence of the tie’s design, indicating intentional preservation of this detail.",

      "question": "Is the checkered pattern on the suit jacket retained in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suit jacket in Image B is drawn with a clear checkered or plaid pattern, using alternating dark and light squares. This directly corresponds to the visual texture of the jacket in Image A, which also features a similar checkered design. The illustration uses bold lines and contrast to emphasize the pattern, ensuring it remains visually apparent despite the stylization. Given that the checkered pattern is a defining feature of the suit, its retention in the artwork indicates attention to detail and fidelity to the original image.",

      "question": "Is the striped dress shirt visible and consistent beneath the suit in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress shirt underneath the suit jacket is depicted with vertical stripes, which aligns with the striped pattern visible in Image A. The stripes are consistently spaced and run parallel down the shirt, maintaining the same visual rhythm as in the original photograph. Even though the illustration is stylized, the shirt’s design is clearly represented and not obscured by the suit or other elements. This consistency suggests that the artist intentionally preserved the shirt’s details for authenticity.",

      "question": "Is the short-cropped hairstyle retained in the man's illustrated appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man’s hair is depicted as short and neatly cropped, particularly at the sides and back, with a receding hairline at the front. This matches the hairstyle seen in Image A, where the man has thinning, short hair typical of an older individual. The illustration simplifies the hair into clean lines but preserves the essential shape and volume, especially around the crown and temples. The overall silhouette of the hair is consistent with the original, indicating that the artist maintained this characteristic feature.",
