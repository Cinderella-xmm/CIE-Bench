      "question": "Is the bird rendered in a vibrant yellow color matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is depicted with a bright, vivid yellow plumage that closely matches the visual characteristics of the bird in Image A. The yellow tone is consistent across both images, suggesting that the artist or designer aimed to preserve the bird's original coloration. This choice aligns with common design practices where naturalistic colors are retained for aesthetic and symbolic coherence, especially in product packaging. Given that cherry blossoms and birds are often associated with spring and renewal, maintaining the vibrant yellow enhances the visual appeal and thematic consistency. Therefore, based on visual comparison and typical design logic, the bird's color in Image B matches that of the original.",

      "question": "Are there distinct black stripes visible on the bird’s wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird’s wings clearly display sharp, dark black stripes running along the feather edges, particularly noticeable on the primary and secondary flight feathers. These markings are consistent with the wing patterns seen in many small passerine birds, such as the golden warbler or similar species, which often have contrasting wing bars. The presence of these stripes adds depth and realism to the illustration, enhancing its visual fidelity. Comparing this to Image A, the same black striping is present, confirming that the feature has been preserved. The inclusion of these details suggests an intention to accurately represent the bird’s natural appearance, even in a stylized context like packaging art.",

      "question": "Does the bird have a clearly defined round black eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird’s eye is prominently featured as a large, round, solid black circle with a subtle highlight, giving it a lifelike and expressive quality. This depiction is typical in both realistic illustrations and stylized representations of birds, where a prominent eye helps convey alertness and vitality. The eye is centrally positioned and sharply defined, contributing to the overall balance and focus of the composition. When compared to Image A, the eye structure is nearly identical—round, black, and reflective—indicating that the essential anatomical detail has been preserved. This consistency supports the idea that the illustrator prioritized accurate representation despite the artistic medium.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms depicted with five rounded petals and a pale pink color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cherry blossoms in Image B are illustrated with five soft, rounded petals arranged symmetrically around a central cluster of stamens, which is characteristic of Prunus serrulata (Japanese cherry). The color is a delicate pale pink, consistent with the natural hue of blooming sakura flowers. This depiction aligns with botanical accuracy and cultural aesthetics associated with cherry blossoms in East Asian art. In comparison to Image A, the floral elements maintain the same petal count and color palette, though the background in Image B is more uniform and stylized. The use of five-petaled flowers reinforces authenticity, as most cherry blossom varieties exhibit this trait. Thus, the rendering in Image B adheres to both biological and artistic conventions.",

      "question": "Are the bird’s feet orange-yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird’s feet are rendered in a warm orange-yellow tone, which contrasts subtly with the bright yellow body but harmonizes with the overall color scheme. This coloration is plausible for certain small songbirds, such as warblers, whose legs and feet can range from pale yellow to orange depending on the species. While some birds have gray or brown feet, the orange-yellow shade here appears intentional for visual contrast and aesthetic balance within the design. Comparing to Image A, the feet share the same color, indicating consistency in the design approach. The choice of this specific hue likely serves to enhance the vibrancy of the illustration without overwhelming the viewer.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird’s feet are shown curled around a thin branch, with toes splayed outward in a natural perching posture. This positioning mimics how real birds grip branches using their zygodactyl or anisodactyl foot structure, providing stability while perched. The claws appear slightly curved and engaged with the branch, reinforcing the impression of active support. This detail reflects an understanding of avian anatomy and behavior. When compared to Image A, the foot placement is nearly identical—both show the bird securely perched. The preservation of this biomechanical detail suggests that the designer paid close attention to realism, even within a stylized context. Thus, the feet are indeed positioned as if gripping a branch.",
