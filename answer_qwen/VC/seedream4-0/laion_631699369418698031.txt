    "Question": "Q1: Are the two upward-curving horn-like protrusions still present on either side of the top face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top face of the totem pole is clearly visible within a glass dome. The two upward-curving horn-like protrusions are distinctly present on either side of the top face. These features are consistent with traditional totem pole designs that often include stylized animal or spiritual elements. The lighting and clarity of the image allow for a clear observation of these details, confirming their presence. Comparing this to typical artistic representations of such carvings, these horns are characteristic of symbolic or mythological figures in indigenous art. Therefore, based on visual evidence and cultural design patterns, the horns are indeed present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the rectangular frame with horizontal grooves still positioned directly below the top face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the area immediately beneath the top face shows a carved rectangular structure with distinct horizontal grooves. This element is consistent with the decorative framing commonly seen in totem pole art, where geometric patterns symbolize various spiritual or ancestral meanings. The frame appears intact and properly aligned below the top face, matching the structural design observed in similar wooden carvings. There is no visual distortion or omission in this region. Thus, the rectangular frame with horizontal grooves remains present and correctly positioned.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a small circular carving located on the front of the middle figure's torso?",
    "explanation": "Observing the middle section of the totem in Image B, a small circular indentation is visible on the front of the torso, just below the neck area. This detail is consistent with symbolic carvings found in many indigenous totem poles, where circles may represent eyes, buttons, or spiritual symbols. The texture and depth of the carving suggest it was intentionally crafted. This feature is not only present but also well-defined under the lighting conditions, indicating its deliberate inclusion in the design. Hence, the small circular carving is confirmed to be present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the diamond-patterned border still present around the lower edge of the totem?",
    "explanation": "At the base of the totem in Image B, a distinct border composed of repeating diamond-shaped carvings is visible. This pattern is common in traditional wood carvings as a decorative and symbolic element, often representing strength, unity, or natural motifs like mountains or water. The clarity of the image allows for a detailed inspection of the bottom edge, where the diamond pattern is uniformly carved and intact. This matches known stylistic elements in Pacific Northwest Native American totem art. Therefore, the diamond-patterned border is clearly present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the natural wood grain texture clearly visible across the surface of the totem?",
    "explanation": "The surface of the totem in Image B exhibits a rich, detailed wood grain texture that runs vertically along the entire length of the carving. The lighting enhances the visibility of the grain, which appears consistent with natural hardwood, possibly cedar, commonly used in traditional totem poles. The texture is not obscured by paint or artificial finishes, allowing the organic patterns of the wood to remain prominent. This natural appearance supports authenticity and craftsmanship, aligning with real-world examples of hand-carved totems. Thus, the wood grain is clearly visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do all three faces have closed eyes and open mouths with visible teeth?",
    "explanation": "Examining each face in Image B: the top face has closed eyes (slightly curved lines) and an open mouth with visible teeth; the middle face also has closed eyes and an open mouth with defined teeth; and the bottom face similarly displays closed eyes and an open mouth with teeth. This consistency in facial expression across all three figures is typical in certain styles of totem art, where such features convey spiritual or ancestral presence. All three faces share the same design language, and the details are clearly rendered. Therefore, all faces meet the criteria of having closed eyes and open mouths with visible teeth.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the bottom face larger than the middle face, which is larger than the top face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the relative sizes of the three faces can be assessed by comparing their proportions. The bottom face is visibly wider and more prominent than the middle face, which in turn is larger than the top face. This tiered size progression is a common design principle in totem poles, where the base figure represents foundational or primary spirits, and the smaller upper figures represent secondary or ascending entities. The perspective and scale within the glass dome confirm this hierarchical sizing. Thus, the bottom face is indeed larger than the middle, which is larger than the top.",
    "answer": "Yes"
