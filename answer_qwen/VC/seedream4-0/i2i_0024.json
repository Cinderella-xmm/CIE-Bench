      "question": "Does the tennis player retain the pose with her right arm holding the racket and her left arm raised in a fist pump?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon-style depiction of the tennis player shows her right arm holding the racket, which aligns with the original pose. However, her left arm is not raised in a fist pump; instead, it is extended forward in a two-finger 'peace' gesture, which is part of the sticker-style overlay elements. This gesture is separate from the main character's body and appears as a floating graphic. Therefore, while the right arm holding the racket is preserved, the left arm’s position does not reflect a fist pump but rather a peace sign. The visual cue of the floating hand suggests that this is an added element for stylistic or symbolic purposes, not a faithful representation of the original pose.",

      "question": "Are the clay court lines present with a white outline to define the boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background clearly shows a clay tennis court with visible white lines marking the boundaries of the playing area. These lines are consistent with standard tennis court markings, including the baseline and sideline. Although the image has been overlaid with cartoon-style graphics, the underlying court surface retains its original layout and coloration. The white lines are still present and serve to define the court boundaries, just as they would in a real tennis setting. This observation is supported by world knowledge about tennis court design, where white lines are essential for gameplay and boundary definition.",

      "question": "Does the tennis player wear an orange dress and a white visor, preserving their basic shapes and colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon version of the tennis player wears a red dress and a white visor. While the visor matches the original in color and shape (white and sun-protective), the dress is depicted in red rather than orange. The original image (Image A) shows the player wearing a bright orange dress, but in the edited version, the color has been changed to red, likely due to artistic simplification or stylization common in cartoon illustrations. The basic shape of the dress—a sleeveless, knee-length tennis dress—is preserved, but the color deviates from the original. Therefore, while the shape is maintained, the color is not accurate to the original.",

      "question": "Is the tennis racket represented as a black-filled shape with minimal detailing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis racket is depicted with a black outline and a white string pattern, but it is not filled entirely in black. Instead, the frame is outlined in black, and the strings are shown in a grid pattern with white fill, indicating some level of detail. This contrasts with a 'black-filled shape with minimal detailing,' which would imply a solid black silhouette without internal features. The racket in the image includes structural details such as the handle, grip, and string pattern, suggesting a more detailed representation than a simple black-filled shape. Thus, the racket is not minimally detailed nor entirely black-filled.",

      "question": "Does the player exhibit a tennis-related gesture (specifically, the fist pump)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player's left hand is not shown in a fist pump gesture. Instead, there are two floating 'peace' signs (V-signs) near the player, one of which is positioned near where her left hand would be. These are stylized graphic elements, not part of the player’s actual pose. The fist pump is a common celebratory gesture in sports, especially after winning a point, but it is absent here. The player's actual posture shows both hands on the racket, ready to swing, which is a preparatory stance rather than a celebratory one. Therefore, despite the presence of the peace sign graphics, the player herself does not exhibit a fist pump.",
