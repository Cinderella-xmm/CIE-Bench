      "question": "Is the geisha’s hair styled in an elaborate updo with multiple golden hairpins, floral ornaments, and dangling tassels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geisha's hairstyle is clearly visible and highly ornate. The hair is pulled back into a traditional Japanese updo, which is consistent with historical geisha hairstyles. Numerous decorative elements are present: golden hairpins are arranged in a radial pattern around the top of the head, floral ornaments (including what appear to be cherry blossoms and other flowers) are integrated into the style, and several dangling tassels hang from the side, adding movement and detail. These elements align with traditional geisha aesthetics, where intricate hair accessories are symbolic of status and artistry. The use of stained-glass-like rendering does not obscure these details but rather enhances their visual richness. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and cultural knowledge of geisha attire, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Does the geisha have a white-painted face with red lips and darkened eye makeup?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geisha’s facial features are rendered in a stylized yet recognizable manner. Her face is covered in a smooth, uniform white paint, which is characteristic of traditional geisha makeup (known as 'oshiroi'). This white base serves both aesthetic and symbolic purposes, representing purity and elegance. Her lips are distinctly painted bright red, a hallmark of geisha appearance that contrasts sharply with the pale face. The eyes are accentuated with darkened eyeliner and shadow, emphasizing the gaze and contributing to the dramatic expression typical of geisha portraiture. Even though the image has a stained-glass artistic style, these features remain clearly distinguishable. Thus, the description matches known geisha makeup conventions.",

      "question": "Is the fan held in the geisha’s left hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geisha is depicted holding a fan in her right hand. The positioning of the arm and hand is clearly visible, with the fan extended outward from the right side of her body. The fingers are wrapped around the handle, and the fan is open, facing toward the viewer. There is no indication of a fan in the left hand. This observation is confirmed by the anatomical orientation of the figure and the direction of the arm extension. In contrast, while some traditional depictions may vary, this particular pose shows the fan in the right hand. Therefore, the statement that the fan is held in the left hand is incorrect.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms arranged in an arching pattern above and below the geisha?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, cherry blossom branches are prominently featured. Above the geisha, there is a curved branch extending from the upper left to the upper right, forming an arch over her head. Below her, another set of blossoms appears along the lower edge of the composition, particularly on the left and right sides, creating a mirrored or framing effect. This arrangement forms a semi-circular, arching motif that encloses the central figure. The stained-glass style enhances the symmetry and flow of the floral elements, reinforcing the sense of an intentional arching design. This visual structure is consistent with traditional Japanese art motifs, where nature often frames human subjects in harmonious patterns.",

      "question": "Is there a large red bow tied at the back of the kimono?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the back of the geisha’s kimono is partially visible, showing a prominent bow at the waist. This bow is indeed large and predominantly red, with orange and gold accents, and it is tied in a traditional obi knot style. The bow extends downward and curves around the side, contributing to the overall balance of the composition. While the stained-glass medium gives the fabric a fragmented appearance, the shape and color of the bow are unmistakable. In traditional kimonos, especially those worn by geishas, such bows are common and serve both decorative and functional purposes. The presence of this feature is consistent with cultural expectations and visual evidence.",

      "question": "Is the geisha shown in profile with her head turned downward and body facing to the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geisha is positioned in a three-quarter view, not a full profile. Her body is oriented slightly toward the right, but her head is turned more significantly downward and to the right, giving a sense of introspection or modesty. However, she is not fully in profile—her face is angled such that part of the front is visible, indicating a slight frontal view. The posture suggests a gentle turn, but the head tilt is pronounced. Comparing this to standard representations of geishas in art, this pose reflects a classic contemplative stance. While the body faces right, the head is lowered, not simply turned sideways. Therefore, the description of being in full profile is inaccurate; the correct characterization is a three-quarter view with a downward head tilt.",
