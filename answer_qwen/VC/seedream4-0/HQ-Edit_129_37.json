      "question": "Are the cardinal direction labels N, E, S, and W clearly visible and correctly positioned on the embossed compass face of the perfume bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the embossed compass face is part of a perfume bottle design that mimics a vintage compass. Observing the outer ring of the compass face, the letters N, E, S, and W are visible and appear to be positioned at their respective cardinal points—N at the top, E on the right, S at the bottom, and W on the left. These placements align with standard compass orientation. The lettering is embossed in a clear, legible font, consistent with traditional compass designs. Based on visual inspection and common knowledge of compass layout, the cardinal directions are both visible and correctly oriented.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the full 360-degree scale with numerical markings (e.g., 0, 90, 180, 270) present and evenly spaced around the outer edge of the embossed compass face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the outer edge of the embossed compass face in Image B, there are numerical markings visible at regular intervals. Notably, numbers such as 0, 90, 180, and 270 can be identified at their correct positions corresponding to the cardinal and intercardinal directions. The spacing between these marks appears uniform, suggesting even distribution across the 360-degree scale. This detail reflects accurate representation of a traditional compass dial. Given that compasses typically include such a full scale for precise directional measurement, and the visual evidence supports this, the scale is present and properly spaced.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the embossed compass face retain the original eight-pointed star-like radial pattern with symmetrical arms extending from the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central design of the embossed compass face in Image B features a symmetrical radial pattern resembling an eight-pointed star, with arms extending outward from the center. This pattern is characteristic of classic compass roses, which often include eight primary wind directions (cardinal and intercardinal). The symmetry and even distribution of the arms suggest careful replication of the original design. Visual analysis confirms that each arm is balanced and aligned radially, maintaining the aesthetic and functional integrity of a traditional compass rose.",

      "question": "Is the body of the perfume bottle perfectly circular in shape, matching the original compass’s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the perfume bottle in Image B has a circular base, closely resembling the original compass’s round outline. However, due to the presence of a transparent glass section and slight curvature from the material's refraction, the edges appear slightly distorted or softened in the image. Despite this, the overall silhouette remains consistently circular, and the diameter matches that of the original compass. The design intention seems to preserve the original compass shape, and no significant deviation from circularity is observed. Thus, it can be concluded that the body maintains a perfect circular form as intended.",

      "question": "Does the cap of the perfume bottle feature engraved cartographic details such as a compass rose and intersecting grid lines, matching those seen on the map fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap of the perfume bottle in Image B is cylindrical and topped with a flat surface that displays intricate engravings. Upon close inspection, these engravings include a compass rose with radiating lines and intersecting grid patterns similar to those found on antique maps. The design elements match the style of the fragmented map pieces scattered nearby, which also show compass roses and navigational grids. This suggests intentional thematic consistency between the cap and the surrounding artifacts. Therefore, the cap does feature cartographic details that align with the map fragments.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small central raised dot or hub at the exact center of the embossed compass face, corresponding to the original needle pivot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the center of the embossed compass face in Image B, there is a small, raised circular element that serves as a focal point. This feature resembles a pivot point or hub, typical of traditional compasses where the needle rotates. Its placement is precisely at the geometric center of the compass rose, consistent with the function of a needle pivot. The design choice reflects authenticity in replicating mechanical compass components. Given its size, position, and appearance, it corresponds directly to the original needle pivot.",

      "question": "Is the outer ring of the embossed compass face clearly delineated with fine engravings and consistent spacing between degree marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outer ring of the embossed compass face in Image B shows fine, detailed engravings that mark degrees around the circumference. These engravings are uniformly spaced, with short tick marks indicating individual degrees and longer ones at key intervals (e.g., every 10 or 20 degrees). The precision of these markings, combined with their clarity and regularity, indicates careful craftsmanship. Such detailing is essential in accurate compasses for measuring bearings. The visual evidence supports the presence of consistent spacing and clear delineation, matching expectations for high-quality navigational instruments.",
