    "Question": "Q1: Is the dorsal ridge composed of a series of raised, looped structures running along the back of the pig?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dorsal ridge of the pig is clearly visible along its back. It consists of a series of raised, rounded, and looped structures that resemble braided or twisted elements. These are evenly spaced and form a continuous line from the neck to the base of the tail. The texture and shape of these structures are consistent with a decorative, sculpted design typical of ceramic art. Based on visual analysis, the dorsal ridge is not flat or smooth but has distinct, looped protrusions. This matches the description of 'raised, looped structures.' Therefore, the answer is affirmative.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the tail extend from the rear of the pig and terminate in a fluffy pom-pom?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the pig extends from the rear end of the body and is clearly visible. It is formed into a braided or twisted shape, similar in style to the dorsal ridge. At the end of the tail, there is a cluster of fine, frayed strands that resemble a pom-pom. Although it is not made of yarn like in a knitted object, the sculpted form mimics the appearance of a fluffy pom-pom. Given the artistic style of the ceramic pig, this detail is intentionally designed to resemble a soft, tufted end. Thus, the tail does indeed terminate in a pom-pom-like structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are there four short legs attached beneath the body, two on each side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pig's body rests on four distinct leg structures. Two legs are visible on the left side (from the viewerâ€™s perspective), and two are visible on the right. Each leg is short and stout, typical of stylized pig figures. The legs are symmetrically placed under the body and support the figure in a stable stance. Even though the front legs are partially obscured by the hand holding the pig, their presence is confirmed by the visible portions and the overall symmetry of the figure. This aligns with the anatomical expectation of a four-legged animal representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a rounded snout extending forward from the face of the pig?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the pig are clearly defined. The snout is prominent and projects forward from the face, forming a rounded, bulbous shape that ends in two small nostrils. This is characteristic of pig anatomy and is accurately represented in the ceramic sculpture. The snout is not flat or retracted; instead, it extends outward, giving the pig a naturalistic yet stylized expression. This matches the description of a 'rounded snout extending forward,' which is consistent with both biological knowledge and artistic depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are there two small, upright ears positioned on the top of the head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pig has two ears located on the top of its head. They are small in size and appear to be slightly curved or folded, rather than fully upright. However, they are positioned at the apex of the head and project upward, which qualifies them as 'upright' in a general sense. While not perfectly vertical, their placement and orientation suggest an attempt to represent typical pig ears. In many artistic representations, especially stylized ones, ears may be simplified or slightly bent. Given the context, the ears are present and correctly positioned on the head, fulfilling the basic criteria of the question.",
    "answer": "Yes"
