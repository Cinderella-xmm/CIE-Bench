      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual texture of the sunflowers and vase appears smooth and uniform, lacking the visible impasto technique characteristic of Van Gogh's original style. The brushwork in the original painting (Image A) is highly textured, with thick, layered strokes that create a three-dimensional effect. In contrast, Image B shows a more photorealistic rendering where the surface appears flat and polished, especially noticeable on the vase and petals. This suggests that the thick, textured brushstrokes have been smoothed out or replaced with digital rendering techniques to fit into a modern interior setting. Therefore, the original tactile quality of the brushwork is not preserved.",

      "question": "Is the bright golden yellow color of the sunflowers preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunflowers in Image B retain the dominant golden yellow hue seen in the original painting. The petals are vivid and saturated, matching the intensity of Van Gogh’s palette. However, due to lighting effects from the window blinds in the background, there are subtle variations in brightness and shadow across the flowers, which slightly alter the perception of color compared to the flat, evenly lit original. Despite these lighting differences, the core color—bright golden yellow—is faithfully maintained. Thus, the overall color scheme remains consistent with the original.",

      "question": "Is the off-white and yellow color of the vase, including the handwritten signature \"Vincent,\" retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vase in Image B maintains the off-white base with yellow accents, consistent with the original painting. The signature 'Vincent' is clearly visible on the lower portion of the vase, written in a cursive script similar to the original. While the lighting in Image B casts shadows and reflections on the vase surface, the text remains legible and stylistically accurate. The coloration and placement of the signature suggest it has been carefully preserved during the digital integration process. No distortions or alterations to the signature or color scheme are evident.",

      "question": "Are the sunflowers positioned in the vase as they were originally, maintaining their natural arrangement and angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the flower arrangement in Image B to the original (Image A), the overall composition is largely preserved—the number of sunflowers, their general orientation, and the way they lean and overlap remain consistent. However, slight adjustments may have been made to accommodate the new environment (e.g., kitchen table). For example, some stems appear slightly repositioned to fit within the frame and align better with the light source from the window. These changes are minimal but suggest a minor reconfiguration for aesthetic balance in the modern context. Nevertheless, the natural, dynamic grouping of the flowers is still intact, preserving the essence of the original arrangement.",

      "question": "Are the natural placements of the leaves and stems, including their green color and texture, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green leaves and stems are present and generally match the original in terms of color and placement. However, upon close inspection, the texture of the leaves appears smoother and less detailed than in the original painting, where Van Gogh used expressive brushwork to convey leaf veins and rough edges. In the edited image, the greenery seems integrated into a more realistic rendering, possibly losing some of the painterly texture. Additionally, the lighting enhances certain areas, making some leaves appear brighter or more defined than others, which may affect perceived naturalness. While the basic structure and color are preserved, the textural fidelity of the foliage is reduced.",
