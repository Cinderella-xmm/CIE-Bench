      "question": "Are the pointed gables with spire-like finials at the roof peaks present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure features multiple gabled sections, each culminating in a sharply pointed peak. At the apex of these gables, small spire-like finials are clearly visible—these are ornamental elements that extend vertically above the roofline. These finials are consistent with Gothic or fairy-tale architectural styles, commonly seen in elaborate miniature houses. The presence of such details is supported by visual clarity and symmetry across the roofline. This matches common design motifs in whimsical or fantasy-style architecture, where finials serve both decorative and symbolic purposes.",

      "question": "Is there a central balcony with intricately carved wooden railing located below the uppermost gable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the front facade of the structure in Image B, directly beneath the tallest central gable, there is a balcony. This balcony features a wooden railing with detailed carvings, including scrollwork and floral patterns. The craftsmanship suggests hand-carved elements typical of ornate miniatures. The balcony is positioned centrally and appears to be accessible from an upper-level window or door. This aligns with architectural conventions for decorative balconies in fantasy or Victorian-inspired designs. Given its placement and detail, it can be confidently identified as the described feature.",

      "question": "Are there arched windows with decorative tracery visible on the front facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the front of the structure in Image B, several windows are visible. The central upper window, located just above the balcony, has a distinct arched shape with internal decorative tracery—this includes geometric and floral patterns within the glass panes. Additional side windows also exhibit arched tops and subtle detailing. Such tracery is characteristic of Gothic Revival or fairy-tale architecture, often used to enhance visual appeal. The clarity of the image allows identification of these intricate patterns, confirming their presence.",

      "question": "Is the roof covered in blue shingles (or sapphire-colored material)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The roof of the structure in Image B is clearly covered with tiles that have a deep blue hue, resembling sapphire or glazed ceramic shingles. These tiles are arranged in overlapping rows and reflect light in a way that suggests a glossy finish. Their color and texture are consistent with decorative roofing materials used in fantasy or ornamental models. The uniformity and vividness of the blue indicate intentional design choice, likely to evoke a magical or enchanted aesthetic. This is visually distinct and matches the description of sapphire-colored material.",

      "question": "Does the exterior of the structure retain a visible natural wood texture and finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The walls and structural supports of the house in Image B display a light brown tone with visible grain patterns, indicating a natural wood texture. The columns, beams, and railings all show fine details consistent with real wood, such as knots and surface variations. While some parts may be painted or treated, the overall appearance maintains a realistic wooden finish, especially noticeable in areas like the porch posts and base frame. This suggests the use of either real wood or high-quality wood simulation in the model’s construction, preserving the organic aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is there a single wooden door located at the center of the base level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the ground level of the structure in Image B, a single wooden door is positioned centrally. It is framed by arched openings and flanked by symmetrical columns. The door has a simple panel design and appears to be made of the same light-toned wood as the rest of the structure. Its placement at the center of the base level aligns with traditional architectural symmetry and serves as the main entrance. This feature is clearly visible and consistent across the image.",

      "question": "Is the facade of the structure symmetrically arranged around a central vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facade of the structure in Image B exhibits strong bilateral symmetry. The central gable, balcony, and door are aligned along a vertical axis. The windows on either side mirror each other in shape, size, and placement. The supporting columns, rooflines, and decorative elements are evenly distributed left and right. Even the landscaping under the glass dome is symmetrically arranged with flowerbeds and moss. This deliberate balance reflects classic architectural principles of symmetry, commonly found in formal or fantasy-inspired designs. The symmetry is visually apparent and consistent throughout the structure.",
