      "question": "Is the subject wearing a white powdered wig with tightly curled hair arranged in symmetrical loops around the ears and back of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hairstyle is clearly visible. It features a voluminous, white wig with tight curls that are symmetrically arranged, forming distinct loops around the ears and extending down the back of the head. This style is characteristic of 18th-century European fashion, particularly among aristocrats and royalty. The curls are well-defined and sculpted, consistent with the use of powdered wigs during that period. The symmetry and precision of the curls suggest a formal, stylized presentation typical of historical portraits. Based on visual cues such as color (white), texture (curly), and arrangement (symmetrical loops), it is clear that the subject is wearing a powdered wig in the traditional manner.",

      "question": "Does the subject wear a red coat with visible gold embroidery forming floral and scroll patterns along the lapel and cuff?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's attire includes a bright red coat. Upon close inspection, the lapel and cuff areas display intricate gold embroidery. These designs consist of swirling scrollwork and floral motifs, which are common decorative elements in historical aristocratic clothing. The patterns are evenly spaced and detailed, suggesting a high level of craftsmanship. The gold thread appears raised and reflective, enhancing the ornate nature of the garment. Given the visual evidence of both color and design, it is evident that the coat features gold embroidery in floral and scroll patterns along the lapel and cuff.",

      "question": "Is there a blue sash draped diagonally across the torso from the left shoulder to the right hip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a prominent blue sash is visible across the subject's torso. It originates from the left shoulder and extends diagonally downward toward the right hip. The sash is wide and smooth, with a slight sheen, indicating a fabric like satin or silk. Its placement and angle are consistent with ceremonial or royal insignia, often used to denote rank or honor. The sash is clearly visible against the red coat, and its path aligns perfectly with the described diagonal trajectory. Therefore, based on the visual positioning and appearance, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Is there a white lace cravat with a ruffled edge visible at the neck, tucked beneath the coat collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s neck area shows a white, ruffled collar that extends from beneath the coat’s high collar. This element has a delicate, layered appearance with scalloped edges, consistent with lace or fine fabric commonly used in 18th-century formal wear. The ruffles are soft and slightly voluminous, suggesting a cravat or jabot style accessory. It is positioned neatly under the coat collar, which is typical for such garments. The texture and shape match the description of a white lace cravat with a ruffled edge. Thus, the visual evidence supports this claim.",

      "question": "Is the background a smooth gradient transitioning from dark gray on the left to lighter blue-gray on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the subject displays a subtle gradient. On the left side, the color is darker, appearing as a deep gray. As the eye moves to the right, the tone gradually lightens into a softer blue-gray hue. The transition between these colors is smooth and lacks abrupt changes, indicating a deliberate gradient effect. This type of background is often used in portrait art to create depth and focus attention on the subject. The absence of sharp lines or textures confirms the gradient nature. Therefore, the background matches the described transition.",

      "question": "Is the subject positioned in a three-quarter view, facing slightly to the right with the head turned toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted in a pose where the body is angled to the right, showing more of the left side of the torso. However, the head is turned forward, directly engaging the viewer. This combination of a tilted body and a frontal-facing head is characteristic of a three-quarter view. The shoulders are not fully aligned with the face, but the facial orientation is centered, creating a balanced composition. This pose allows for both depth and direct engagement, typical in formal portraiture. Hence, the subject is indeed in a three-quarter view with the head turned toward the viewer.",

      "question": "Does the red coat exhibit a reflective, textured surface consistent with velvet fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red coat has a glossy, smooth surface with highlights that suggest reflectivity. However, upon closer examination, the surface appears uniformly shiny without the nap or pile typically associated with velvet. Instead, the material looks more like a polished plastic or synthetic finish, common in stylized or animated representations. Velvet would show variations in light absorption due to its fibrous texture, but here the surface is too uniform and slick. Therefore, while the coat is red and richly colored, its texture does not align with real velvet but rather with a manufactured, non-porous material. Thus, the coat does not exhibit a surface consistent with velvet fabric.",
