      "question": "Is the mirror still framed in gold?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror is clearly visible and has a thin, metallic frame that reflects light with a warm, golden hue. This visual cue strongly suggests the frame is made of or coated with gold. The color and finish are consistent with typical brass or gold-toned metal used in modern bathroom fixtures. The frame's appearance remains unchanged from its original state in terms of material and design, indicating continuity in style. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and common design practices, the mirror retains its gold framing.",

      "question": "Are the faucets still made of brass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faucets exhibit a polished, warm metallic finish with a reflective surface that is characteristic of brass. The color and luster match typical brass fixtures commonly used in bathrooms for their durability and aesthetic appeal. There is no indication of discoloration or change in material, such as a shift to chrome or stainless steel. Comparing this to Image A, where the same faucets appear identical in finish and design, it confirms that the material has not changed. Thus, the faucets remain brass.",

      "question": "Is the marble countertop texture still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the countertop displays a white base with gray veining, which is a hallmark of marble. The pattern is consistent across the surface, showing natural stone characteristics. Even though the mirror now reflects a cityscape, the countertop itself remains unchanged in texture and appearance. When compared to Image A, the marble’s intricate veining and glossy finish are preserved, confirming that the texture is still present. The reflection in the mirror does not alter the physical properties of the countertop.",

      "question": "Has the wall retained its neutral gray color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall behind the mirror in Image B appears to be a consistent, matte gray tone. This color is neutral and matches the typical interior design choice for modern bathrooms to create a calm and sophisticated atmosphere. The lighting above the mirror casts a soft glow, but it does not alter the perceived color of the wall. Comparing this to Image A, the wall color is identical—no visible changes in shade or tone have occurred. Therefore, the wall has retained its neutral gray color.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window on the right side of the frame shows a blurred but identifiable view of foliage outside. The presence of green leaves and tree branches indicates that vegetation is still visible. Although the mirror now displays a cityscape, the window remains unobstructed and continues to show the outdoor environment. Compared to Image A, where the same greenery was visible, there is no obstruction or change in the view. Thus, the greenery remains visible through the window.",
