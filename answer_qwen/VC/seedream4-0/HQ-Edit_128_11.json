      "question": "Is the black grand piano with an open lid and visible keyboard present in the center of the stage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central focus is a grand piano positioned directly in the middle of the stage. The piano is black, with its lid open upward, revealing the internal structure and strings, which is typical for performance settings to enhance sound projection. The keyboard is clearly visible, indicating that it is ready for playing. This aligns with standard concert hall setups where a grand piano is placed centrally for optimal acoustics and visual prominence. The piano's placement and design are consistent with classical music performances in formal venues.",

      "question": "Is the stage floor made of polished wood with visible reflections of the piano and ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stage floor in Image B appears to be made of polished wood, as indicated by its smooth surface and warm brown tone. There are subtle reflections visible on the floor, particularly beneath the piano and along the edges, suggesting a glossy finish that reflects both the piano and ambient lighting from the chandelier. These reflections are characteristic of well-maintained wooden floors in concert halls, which are often polished to enhance aesthetics and acoustics. While the sepia tone of the image may slightly obscure details, the reflective quality is still discernible.",

      "question": "Is the central dome ceiling featuring a painted fresco with floral motifs and a surrounding gilded border still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central dome ceiling is clearly visible and features a decorative design consistent with classical architecture. Although the image has a sepia or vintage filter applied, the circular pattern, ornate detailing, and what appears to be floral motifs within the dome suggest a painted fresco. The surrounding area includes a gilded border, which is typical of opulent concert halls like those in Europe. The overall composition of the ceiling matches historical designs found in grand theaters, supporting the presence of such artistic elements even under the stylized color treatment.",

      "question": "Is the large chandelier suspended from the center of the ceiling, composed of multiple tiers of crystals and candle-like lights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chandelier in Image B is prominently displayed at the center of the dome ceiling. It features multiple tiers, each adorned with crystal-like elements that catch the light, and numerous candle-like bulbs arranged symmetrically around the structure. This design is characteristic of grand chandeliers found in classical concert halls, designed to provide both illumination and aesthetic grandeur. The tiered structure and reflective surfaces confirm its complexity and ornamental purpose, consistent with high-end interior design.",

      "question": "Are the audience seats arranged in multiple curved tiers surrounding the stage in a symmetrical fashion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the audience seated in a semi-circular arrangement around the stage, with multiple levels or tiers visible. The seating extends upward in concentric arcs, creating a symmetrical layout typical of traditional concert halls. The silhouette of the audience members forms a continuous curve on both sides, reinforcing the radial symmetry. This architectural design ensures optimal viewing and acoustic experience for all attendees, which is standard in classical performance venues. Despite the stylized rendering, the structural symmetry remains evident.",
