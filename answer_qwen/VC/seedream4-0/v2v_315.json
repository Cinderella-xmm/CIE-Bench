      "question": "Does the echidna retain its detailed spines and naturalistic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the echidna is depicted with a stylized, cartoonish design. Its spines are clearly visible and rendered in a way that emphasizes their texture and direction, but they are simplified and exaggerated compared to real-life echidnas. The overall appearance is less naturalistic and more animated, with smooth, rounded forms and uniform coloration. This suggests a shift from realism to a more playful, illustrative style. While the spines are still present and detailed in a stylized manner, the naturalistic appearance is compromised due to the artistic exaggeration and simplification typical of 3D cartoon rendering.",

      "question": "Are the warm, golden hues and lighting of the surreal landscape retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the warm, golden color palette seen in the original scene. The lighting continues to cast soft shadows and highlights across the terrain and characters, preserving the glowing, surreal atmosphere. The background rock formations and ground surface reflect the same golden tones, indicating that the lighting scheme and color grading have been consistently applied. This continuity in color and illumination suggests that the mood and ambiance of the surreal landscape are preserved despite stylistic changes.",

      "question": "Is the echidna still positioned near the girl's feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the echidna is located directly in front of the girl, close to her feet, maintaining the spatial relationship observed in the original image. Its placement relative to the girl’s legs and stance indicates that it remains in the same general area, reinforcing the interaction between the two characters. The positioning supports a sense of companionship or curiosity, consistent with the narrative setup. Therefore, the echidna’s proximity to the girl’s feet has been preserved.",

      "question": "Are the tall, angular rock formations in the background retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features the same tall, geometric rock formations as seen in the original. These structures are stylized with sharp angles and layered shapes, contributing to the surreal, almost crystalline environment. Despite the change in art style—shifting from a painterly look to a more polished 3D render—the key elements of the landscape remain intact. The formations are still prominent and occupy the same spatial positions, ensuring continuity in the setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The girl in Image B maintains a similar confident stance as in the original: one hand on her hip, the other resting on her knee, with a slightly forward-leaning posture. Her facial expression conveys determination or curiosity, aligning with the character’s demeanor. The composition of the scene—girl on the left, echidna on the right, balanced by background elements—remains largely unchanged. Even though the art style has shifted to a more cartoonish 3D aesthetic, the core pose and layout are preserved, suggesting intentional continuity in storytelling and visual balance.",
