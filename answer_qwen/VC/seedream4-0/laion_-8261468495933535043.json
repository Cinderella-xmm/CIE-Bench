      "question": "Are the two elongated sausage-shaped forms positioned on the left side of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two elongated orange-red forms are constructed from mosaic tiles arranged in a curved, cylindrical shape resembling sausages. They are located on the left side of the composition, which corresponds to the left side of the plate in the original context. The visual arrangement clearly places them on the left, consistent with their positioning in typical food presentation. This is supported by common knowledge that sausages are often placed on one side of a plate, typically the left, for balanced aesthetics. Therefore, based on the spatial layout and visual cues, they are indeed on the left.",

      "question": "Is there a circular form with a central orange-yellow disc representing the egg yolk located in the lower right quadrant of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a circular mosaic structure composed of white tiles forming an outer ring with a cluster of yellow-orange circular tiles at its center. This design mimics a fried egg, where the central yellow-orange area represents the yolk. Its position is in the lower right portion of the image, corresponding to the lower right quadrant of the plate. In real-world food presentation, a fried egg is commonly placed in such a location to balance the plate. The use of color and shape in the mosaic confirms this interpretation. Thus, the description matches the visual evidence.",

      "question": "Is there a cluster of green and red elements in the upper right portion of the plate representing the salad?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a group of irregularly shaped green mosaic tiles arranged in a loose, leafy pattern, interspersed with small red circular tiles resembling cherry tomatoes. This cluster is located in the upper right area of the composition. The green tiles vary in shade, simulating lettuce leaves, while the red elements mimic tomatoes, both common components of a salad. The spatial arrangement and color scheme align with typical salad representation. Given that salads are often placed in the upper right or central-right area of a plate for visual balance, this placement is consistent with culinary presentation norms.",

      "question": "Is the meal arranged on a circular gray plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is plain white, and there is no visible plate. Instead, the mosaic elements appear to be laid out directly on a flat surface without any indication of a plate's edge or curvature. The absence of a border or shadow suggesting a plate implies that the image does not depict the meal on a physical plate. While Image A shows a gray plate, Image B is an artistic reinterpretation using mosaics, likely meant to represent the same meal abstractly. Therefore, the meal is not arranged on a circular gray plate in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the sausages on the left, the egg in the lower right, and the salad in the upper right of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two sausage-like mosaic forms are clearly on the left side. The circular egg-like mosaic with a central yolk is in the lower right section. The green and red mosaic cluster representing the salad is in the upper right. These positions mirror the arrangement seen in Image A, though rendered artistically. The spatial relationships are preserved: sausages on the left, egg in the lower right, and salad in the upper right. This arrangement follows typical Western food plating conventions, where proteins are placed on one side, vegetables in another, and eggs centrally or off-center. The consistency in layout supports the answer.",

      "question": "Are there distinct red circular elements interspersed among the green elements in the salad cluster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the salad cluster consists of various shades of green mosaic tiles forming leafy shapes. Among these, several small, round red tiles are embedded, resembling cherry tomatoes. These red elements are distinctly separated from the green ones and are evenly distributed within the cluster, mimicking the appearance of a fresh salad with tomatoes. The use of red circular tiles contrasts with the green, enhancing the visual representation of a mixed salad. This detail is consistent with how salads are typically composed and presented.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two sausage-shaped mosaic forms are made of orange-red tiles, but there are no visible thin green linear elements resembling rosemary sprigs placed along them. In contrast, Image A shows actual rosemary sprigs garnishing the sausages. However, Image B is a stylized mosaic version, and such fine details as rosemary are omitted or not represented in the same way. There are no green linear elements near the sausages in the mosaic, indicating that this detail was not included in the artistic rendition. Therefore, based solely on Image B, the presence of rosemary cannot be confirmed.",
