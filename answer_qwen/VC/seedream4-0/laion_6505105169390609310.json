      "question": "Is the gold crown present on the head of each of the three figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all three figures are depicted with crowns on their heads. The crowns appear to be golden in color and are consistent with traditional depictions of the Three Wise Men (Magi) from the Nativity scene. Each figure wears a distinct crown, which aligns with the common artistic representation where kings are adorned with regal headwear. This visual cue, combined with world knowledge about the Magi's portrayal in religious art, supports the conclusion that each figure has a gold crown.",

      "question": "Do all three figures have prominent dark beards?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the faces of the three figures in Image B, each one has a clearly visible beard. The beards are dark in color and full in appearance, consistent with typical representations of the Magi as mature, wise men. This is supported by common artistic conventions in Christian iconography, where the Magi are often shown with beards to emphasize their age and wisdom. Therefore, based on both visual evidence and cultural context, all three figures do have prominent dark beards.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the robes of the figures colored in purple/green, red/white/gold, and green/blue respectively, with gold trim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the attire of the figures in Image B: the leftmost figure wears a purple tunic with a green lower garment and a white shawl, all accented with gold trim. The central figure is dressed in a red robe with white inner lining and gold trim. The rightmost figure wears a green tunic with a blue outer cloak, also edged with gold. These colors and patterns match the description provided in the question. The use of gold trim is consistent across all three, reinforcing the royal theme. This matches known artistic renderings of the Magi, where rich colors and gold details signify royalty and wealth.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does each figure hold a golden object (vessel, box, or orb)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each of the three figures is holding a golden object. The leftmost figure holds a golden vessel, possibly representing myrrh. The central figure has a golden orb at his feet, likely symbolizing frankincense or a gift. The rightmost figure holds a golden box, commonly associated with gold. These objects are consistent with the biblical account where the Magi brought gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. The presence of these items, along with their golden color, confirms that each figure is associated with a gift.",

      "question": "Are the hands of the central figure clasped over the chest, and do the other two figures hold their gifts with both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figureâ€™s hands are indeed clasped together over the chest, a gesture often interpreted as reverence or prayer. The leftmost figure holds his golden vessel with both hands, while the rightmost figure also uses both hands to hold his golden box. This posture reflects traditional depictions of the Magi presenting their gifts with respect. The positioning of the hands aligns with symbolic gestures of offering and devotion, supporting the accuracy of this observation.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the central figure noticeably smaller than the other two, and is he standing upright with hands clasped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure appears slightly shorter than the two flanking figures, which may be an intentional design choice to emphasize his role or position. He is standing upright, with his hands clasped over his chest. This posture is consistent with reverence and is commonly seen in religious statuary. While the height difference is subtle, it is noticeable when comparing the figures side by side. The upright stance and hand placement further confirm the description in the question.",
