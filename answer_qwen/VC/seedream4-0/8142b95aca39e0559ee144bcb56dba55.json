      "question": "Is the long beard with visible gray streaks present on the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is a stylized representation placed among matryoshka dolls on a wooden desk. The figure has a long beard, which is clearly visible and detailed. Upon close inspection, the beard contains both dark and lighter (grayish) streaks, suggesting age and realism in the design. This aligns with traditional depictions of ancient Chinese sages or scholars, such as Confucius, who are often portrayed with long beards showing signs of aging. The presence of gray streaks adds depth and authenticity to the character’s appearance. Therefore, based on visual evidence and cultural context, the beard does include visible gray streaks.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's head is shown with a distinct dark hair knot at the top, consistent with traditional Chinese male hairstyles from historical periods, particularly during the Zhou or Han dynasties. This hairstyle, often seen in depictions of philosophers or scholars like Confucius, involves tying the hair into a bun or knot atop the head. The knot is clearly visible in the image, rendered in dark blue or black, matching the style of the original illustration. This detail supports the character’s scholarly or dignified status. Thus, the dark hair knot is present.",

      "question": "Are blue spiral patterns present along the edges of the outer robe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outer robe of the figure features decorative trim along its edges. These trims are predominantly blue and display repeating spiral or swirling motifs, reminiscent of traditional Chinese cloud or flame patterns often used in ceremonial robes. These designs are common in classical Chinese art and symbolize auspiciousness or divine connection. The spirals are clearly visible and consistent across the collar, sleeves, and hem of the robe. This matches the ornamental style seen in historical attire, confirming their presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The inner robe of the figure in Image B is decorated with intricate patterns. While the overall design includes geometric and floral elements, upon closer examination, some motifs resemble stylized flames or clouds—common symbols in Chinese iconography representing heaven, purity, or spiritual energy. These patterns are especially noticeable on the front panel of the inner robe, where they are arranged symmetrically. Such designs are typical in traditional Chinese garments worn by high-status individuals or deities. Therefore, flame-like or cloud-shaped motifs are indeed present.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure’s hands are clearly shown clasped together near the chest, with fingers interlocked in a respectful or meditative pose. This gesture is characteristic of traditional Chinese etiquette, often associated with reverence, teaching, or contemplation. It is commonly seen in depictions of sages and philosophers. The positioning is symmetrical and deliberate, reinforcing the sense of dignity and composure. Thus, the hands are indeed in a clasped gesture near the chest.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure stands upright beside a row of matryoshka dolls. To the right of the figure (from the viewer’s perspective), there is no visible staff or walking stick. Instead, the figure appears to be standing without any support or accessory. In contrast, the original image (Image A) shows a staff leaning against the figure. However, in this edited version, the staff is absent. This omission may be intentional for stylistic or compositional reasons, possibly to integrate the figure more seamlessly with the surrounding dolls. Therefore, the staff is not present in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower portion of the robe in Image B displays a series of horizontal lines and curved shapes that resemble waves or geometric bands. These patterns are concentrated around the hem and the leg area, contributing to the visual complexity of the garment. Wave-like motifs are common in traditional Chinese textiles, symbolizing water, harmony, or movement. The geometric arrangement suggests a structured, symbolic design. Hence, these patterns are clearly visible in the lower robe section.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure wears multiple layers of clothing. The outermost layer is a brown robe with blue trim. Beneath it, an inner garment appears cream-colored, particularly visible at the sleeves and chest area. The lowest layer, covering the legs and feet, is rendered in a purple-blue hue, forming the base of the ensemble. These three colors—brown, cream, and purple-blue—are distinctly separated and identifiable, indicating layered attire typical of historical Chinese dress. The color progression and structural separation confirm the presence of three distinct layers.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robe in Image B features extensive use of blue, particularly along the edges, collars, sleeves, and decorative borders. Blue is consistently applied as a contrasting accent against the dominant brown and cream tones. This choice of color aligns with traditional Chinese aesthetics, where blue often symbolizes virtue, tranquility, or nobility. The repeated use of blue in ornamental patterns reinforces its role as a primary accent color. Therefore, blue is indeed a key accent throughout the robe’s trim.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure maintains an upright posture with a straight back, shoulders aligned, and head held high. This stance conveys dignity and formality, consistent with representations of wise or authoritative figures in Chinese art. The alignment of the body parts—especially the spine and limbs—indicates a balanced and composed posture. Even though the figure is stylized and integrated into a whimsical setting with matryoshka dolls, the posture remains rigid and vertical. Thus, the figure is depicted standing upright with a straight back.",
