      "question": "Is the plaid pattern (with red, blue, and black intersecting lines) on the left tie preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left panel shows a cartoon-style depiction of a tie with a plaid pattern. The pattern consists of intersecting red, blue, and black lines forming a classic tartan design. This matches the visual characteristics of a traditional plaid pattern. The colors and structure are consistent with the description in the question. The tie is anthropomorphized, with arms and hands, but the plaid pattern remains intact and clearly visible. Based on visual analysis, the pattern has not been altered or distorted. Therefore, the plaid pattern is preserved.",

      "question": "Is the green and yellow bear-shaped emblem on the right tie preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom panel shows a tie with an emblem on it. The emblem features a crown above a shield with a bear-like figure, surrounded by laurel wreaths. The colors include gold/yellow and green, consistent with the description of a 'green and yellow bear-shaped emblem'. Although the bear is stylized and part of a larger heraldic design, its shape and color scheme match the described attributes. The emblem is clearly visible and not obscured. Thus, the emblem is preserved in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both ties preserved in their original necktie shape (narrow, tapered, diagonal across the chest)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two ties are depicted in a stylized, comic-book format. The left tie is shown upright, standing in a field, with arms and hands, which deviates from the typical necktie shape. It is not narrow or tapered in a natural way, nor is it diagonally positioned across a chest. Similarly, the right tie, while showing a full length and some tapering, is also standing upright and anthropomorphized, lacking the natural diagonal placement across a torso. Both ties have been transformed into characters with limbs and are not worn in the conventional manner. Therefore, they are not preserved in their original necktie shape.",

      "question": "Is the figure with the plaid tie on the left side of the image, and the figure with the emblem on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top panel shows a single figure — a plaid tie with arms — located on the left side of the frame. In the bottom panel, the man with glasses (from the original photo) is on the left, holding a camera, while the tie with the emblem is on the right side of the frame. The layout clearly places the plaid tie on the left and the emblem-bearing tie on the right. This spatial arrangement aligns with the question's description. Hence, the positioning is correct.",

      "question": "Is the background a grassy field with visible green vegetation extending into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both panels feature a background that consists of a lush green field with tall grass and plants, resembling a cornfield or meadow. The vegetation is dense and extends into the distance, with trees and a pipeline visible in the far background. The lighting and shading suggest depth and continuity. This matches the description of a grassy field with green vegetation stretching into the distance. The background has been maintained consistently across both panels, even though the subjects are stylized. Therefore, the background is accurately represented.",
