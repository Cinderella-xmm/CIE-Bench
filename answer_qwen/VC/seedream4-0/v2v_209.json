      "question": "Are the curved rockers at the base of the chair present and clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocking chair is depicted in a stylized, cartoonish form resembling an enamel pin. Despite the artistic simplification, the rockers at the base are clearly visible and follow a smooth, curved shape typical of traditional rocking chairs. The design maintains the essential structure of rockers that extend from the front legs, forming a continuous arc. Even though the style is not photorealistic, the curvature and positioning of the rockers are unmistakable and well-defined within the illustration.",

      "question": "Is the back of the chair composed of multiple vertical spindles arranged between the top and bottom rails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the back of the chair with a series of vertical elements that resemble spindles. These are evenly spaced and run from the top rail to the bottom rail, consistent with the classic spindle-back design of a rocking chair. Although the illustration is simplified and stylized, the visual representation includes multiple vertical lines that function as spindles, confirming this structural feature. The presence of these spindles aligns with common design patterns in traditional wooden rocking chairs.",

      "question": "Are the armrests curved and connected to the front legs with turned supports?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armrests are visibly curved and extend from the sides of the chairâ€™s frame. They connect to the front legs via what appear to be turned wooden supports, which are stylistically rendered but still recognizable as such. The supports have a tapered, rounded shape typical of turned woodwork, even if exaggerated for aesthetic effect in the pin-style illustration. This matches the traditional construction method where armrests are joined to the front legs using decorative turned posts.",

      "question": "Are there spherical finials at the top of the two upright back posts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the two upright back posts in Image B features small, rounded elements that resemble spherical finials. These are consistent with the decorative finishing commonly found on traditional rocking chairs, where the top of the back posts ends in a ball-like shape. In this stylized depiction, the finials are clearly indicated, albeit simplified, and their placement at the apex of each post confirms their presence. This detail aligns with both visual cues and standard furniture design conventions.",

      "question": "Does the chair maintain its original proportions, with a tall back, curved seat, and balanced leg structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the chair with a tall back, a gently curved seat, and a symmetrical arrangement of legs and rockers. While the style is cartoonish and stylized (resembling a collectible pin), the overall proportions are preserved relative to a real rocking chair. The height of the back is significant compared to the seat, and the legs are proportionally balanced, maintaining the iconic silhouette of a traditional rocking chair. Even with artistic abstraction, the key proportional relationships remain intact.",

      "question": "Are the rockers directly connected to the front legs, forming a continuous curved base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rockers are shown as extending seamlessly from the front legs, forming a single, continuous curved base. This is a defining feature of rocking chairs, where the rockers are integral to the front leg structure, allowing the chair to rock back and forth. The illustration clearly shows this connection, with no gaps or breaks between the legs and rockers. The design preserves this functional and structural element, even in its stylized form.",
