      "question": "Is the bottle’s main body still a transparent rectangular glass container with softly rounded edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is clearly visible and maintains a rectangular shape with softly rounded edges, consistent with typical glassware design for diffusers or premium bottles. The material appears to be clear glass, allowing visibility of the internal contents and reed sticks. The transparency and smooth contours are evident from the light reflections and the way the object interacts with ambient lighting. This shape is common in decorative fragrance diffusers, which often use such forms for aesthetic appeal and stability. Based on visual cues and common design principles, the bottle retains this structural characteristic.",

      "question": "Is the interior of the bottle filled with a golden-yellow translucent liquid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the liquid inside the bottle appears to be clear or pale yellow, not golden-yellow. The color is much lighter than what would be expected from aged whisky (as seen in Image A). Additionally, the presence of black reed sticks suggests it is a fragrance diffuser rather than an alcoholic beverage. Fragrance oils are typically clear or lightly tinted, whereas single malt Scotch whisky like the one in Image A has a rich amber hue due to aging in oak casks. Therefore, based on both visual evidence and world knowledge about fragrance diffusers versus whisky bottles, the liquid is not golden-yellow.",

      "question": "Is the black box with the arched cutout and gold text \"CADENHEAD'S\" at the top and \"ESTD. 1842\" at the bottom still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black presentation box is visibly identical to the one in Image A. It features the same arched cutout window, the gold embossed text 'CADENHEAD'S' at the top, and 'ESTD. 1842' at the bottom. These elements are consistent across both images, indicating that the packaging remains unchanged. Cadenhead's is known for using distinctive black boxes with these markings for their premium products, whether whisky or other luxury items. Thus, the box design is preserved in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are there visible reflections and highlights on the glass surface of the bottle indicating transparency and smoothness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, in Image B, the glass surface of the bottle shows distinct reflections and highlights, especially along the edges and sides. These optical effects are indicative of a smooth, polished glass surface. Light interacts with the glass in a way that reveals its transparency and clarity, consistent with high-quality glassware. Such reflections are typical of transparent materials under studio lighting conditions, confirming the material's smoothness and translucency. This observation aligns with standard physical behavior of glass under direct lighting.",

      "question": "Is the bottle positioned to the left of the box, with the box’s arched window aligned to frame the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is indeed placed to the left of the black box, just as in Image A. The arched cutout of the box is aligned vertically with the bottle, creating a framing effect that emphasizes the product. This arrangement is common in product photography to highlight both the item and its packaging. The alignment ensures that the bottle fits within the visual space created by the cutout, suggesting intentional composition. The positioning remains consistent between the two images, indicating no change in layout.",

      "question": "Does the bottle have a flat, thickened base that rests stably on the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the bottle appears flat and slightly thickened, providing a stable foundation. This is evident from the even contact with the reflective surface beneath it, with no tilting or wobbling observed. Such a design is typical for glass containers meant to stand upright without support, especially in display contexts. The thickness helps prevent tipping, particularly when filled with liquid and reeds. This structural feature is consistent with both functional design principles and the visual evidence in the image.",
