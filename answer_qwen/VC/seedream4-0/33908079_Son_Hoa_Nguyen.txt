    "Question": "Q1: Is the orange circular logo with the white animal figure clearly visible on the sack?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sack worn by the worker is depicted in a stylized, illustrated form. The orange circular logo with a white animal figure (resembling a rabbit or similar creature) is present on the sack. Although the illustration style simplifies details, the logo is clearly outlined and colored distinctly, making it recognizable despite the artistic rendering. The contrast between the orange circle and the white animal figure ensures visibility. This conclusion is based on visual clarity within the cartoon-like depiction, where such design elements are emphasized for aesthetic and symbolic purposes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the worker’s right hand visibly reaching into the tea bush to pick leaves?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the worker's right hand is shown extended toward the tea plants, with fingers positioned as if plucking leaves. The hand is clearly depicted in contact with the foliage, and the posture suggests active harvesting. While the illustration style simplifies anatomical detail, the positioning of the hand—slightly curled and directed into the tea bush—aligns with typical tea-picking gestures. Therefore, based on the visual cues and common knowledge of tea harvesting techniques, the hand is visibly engaged in picking leaves.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the worker leaning forward with her upper body angled downward toward the tea plants?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the worker’s posture shows her upper body bent forward at the waist, with her head lowered toward the tea plants. Her back is arched slightly, and her arms are extended downward, consistent with the physical stance required for manual tea harvesting. This forward lean is a standard ergonomic position used by tea pickers to reach low-growing shrubs efficiently. The illustration captures this dynamic pose accurately, reflecting real-world labor practices.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the sack positioned on the left side of the worker’s waist and hanging downward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sack is attached to the worker’s waist and hangs down along her right side, not the left. The sack is tied around her waist, with the main body extending downward on the right-hand side of her torso. This placement is consistent with how workers often carry collection sacks during harvesting—on one side to allow free movement of the dominant hand. Based on the visual layout, the sack is clearly on the right side, not the left.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the tea plants arranged in distinct diagonal rows across a sloped terrain?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background depicts tea plantations with rows of green bushes that extend diagonally from the foreground to the background. These rows follow the contour of a gently sloping hillside, creating a terraced effect typical of tea cultivation in mountainous regions. The diagonal alignment and layered appearance suggest careful agricultural planning to maximize sunlight exposure and prevent soil erosion. This arrangement is consistent with real-world tea farming practices, especially in regions like China or Sri Lanka.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Does the worker wear a long-sleeved olive-green shirt?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the worker is wearing a long-sleeved shirt that is uniformly olive-green in color. The sleeves extend to the wrists, and the collar and overall cut resemble a practical work garment suitable for outdoor labor. The shade of green is consistent with protective clothing commonly worn by agricultural workers. The illustration style maintains this detail clearly, even though it is simplified compared to a photograph.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the worker’s dark hair styled in a low ponytail with some loose strands near the face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the worker’s hair is dark and tied into a low ponytail at the back of her head. A few loose strands are visible near her forehead and temples, adding a natural, realistic touch to the character’s appearance. This hairstyle is practical for fieldwork, keeping hair out of the face while allowing some movement. The illustration includes these details deliberately, suggesting attention to realism within the artistic style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
