    "Question": "Q1: Is the skier on the right still wearing a bright yellow jacket?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skier on the right is clearly visible and wearing a bright yellow jacket. The color is vivid and consistent with typical high-visibility outdoor winter gear, which is commonly worn for safety and visibility in snowy environments. The jacket appears to be a full-length, insulated ski jacket, appropriate for cold mountain conditions. There are no visual cues suggesting that the jacket has been altered or replaced. Based on this observation and common knowledge about ski apparel, it is reasonable to conclude that the skier is indeed wearing a bright yellow jacket.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the skier on the right still have a helmet on their head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skier on the right is wearing a black helmet, which is clearly visible and properly fitted over their head. Helmets are standard safety equipment in skiing, especially in alpine environments where there is a risk of falls or collisions. The helmet appears to be securely fastened, with a chin strap visible under the jaw, indicating proper use. This aligns with standard skiing safety practices. Therefore, based on both visual evidence and world knowledge about skiing safety, the skier is wearing a helmet.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the skier on the right still in an active skiing posture with bent knees and forward lean?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skier on the right is depicted in a dynamic skiing posture. Their knees are visibly bent, and their body is leaning forward, which is characteristic of an active skiing stance used to maintain balance and control during descent. The position of the poles, angled backward, and the spray of snow behind the skis further suggest motion and engagement in skiing. This posture is consistent with proper technique for downhill skiing. Thus, combining visual cues with knowledge of skiing mechanics, the skier is indeed in an active skiing posture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the snow-covered mountains and clear blue sky still visible in the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a vast landscape of snow-covered mountains extending into the distance, with sharp peaks and valleys typical of alpine terrain. The sky above is clear and blue, with minimal cloud cover, indicating fair weather conditions. These elements are consistent with a high-altitude winter environment suitable for skiing. The lighting suggests midday sun, enhancing visibility of the distant mountains. This matches the expected scenery for such a setting, confirming that the snow-covered mountains and clear blue sky are still present in the background.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the skier on the left still present in the image, wearing a red jacket and skiing posture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skier on the left is still visible, positioned slightly behind and to the side of the skier in yellow. They are wearing a red jacket, which stands out against the white snow, and are in a skiing posture with bent knees and poles in hand, actively descending the slope. The skier's body orientation and the trail of displaced snow indicate movement. This is consistent with the appearance of a second skier in a group descent scenario. Based on visual confirmation and understanding of skiing dynamics, the skier on the left remains present and appropriately dressed and postured.",
    "answer": "Yes"
