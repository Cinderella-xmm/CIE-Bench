      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are shown in a stylized, cartoonish form with exaggerated features and traditional Chinese attire. Despite the artistic transformation, they are positioned on skis and holding ski poles, with their bodies angled forward and legs in motion-like poses, suggesting active movement. The positioning of their limbs and the direction of their gaze indicate forward momentum consistent with skiing. Additionally, the snowy terrain beneath them supports the idea that they are engaged in skiing. While the style is whimsical and not realistic, the visual cues—such as posture, equipment, and environment—are consistent with active skiing. Therefore, based on these visual elements combined with common sense about skiing dynamics, the characters are still depicted as actively skiing.",

      "question": "Are the characters still arranged in a line formation while skiing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are positioned along a path in a staggered but sequential manner, with one character slightly ahead of the others, followed by three more in a trailing order. This arrangement mirrors a line formation typical of cross-country skiing groups. Although the spacing is not perfectly uniform due to the artistic style, the overall alignment suggests a linear progression down the slope. Comparing this to Image A, where five real people are also arranged in a clear line formation while skiing, the edited version maintains the same structural layout. The visual continuity of the path and the relative positions of the characters confirm that they are still arranged in a line formation. Thus, despite the stylistic changes, the spatial organization remains consistent with the original.",

      "question": "Do the characters still hold ski poles and wear skis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each character is clearly equipped with ski poles held in both hands, and skis are visible beneath their feet. The poles are angled backward, indicating use during skiing motion, and the skis are aligned with the direction of travel. Even though the characters are stylized with cartoon-like features and traditional clothing, the presence and correct placement of skiing equipment remain intact. This matches the original image (Image A), where all individuals also hold ski poles and wear skis. The editing process has preserved these essential elements, ensuring functional consistency with the activity being depicted. Hence, the characters in Image B still hold ski poles and wear skis.",

      "question": "Is there still a visible snowy path beneath the characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground beneath the characters is covered in snow, and a well-defined path is visible, marked by ski tracks and a smooth surface suitable for skiing. The path runs through the scene from foreground to background, consistent with the direction of travel. Snow-covered trees and fencing on the sides further emphasize the path’s existence. Compared to Image A, which also shows a clear snowy trail with ski tracks, Image B retains this key environmental feature, albeit with enhanced artistic details such as decorative red symbols and festive decorations. The continuity of the path's appearance confirms its visibility and functionality in the scene. Therefore, yes, there is still a visible snowy path beneath the characters.",

      "question": "Are the characters still moving forward along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body language and orientation of the characters in Image B suggest forward motion. Their skis are angled forward, and their arms are positioned as if propelling themselves using the poles. The sequence of their placement along the path—from front to back—also indicates progression in a single direction. Furthermore, the dynamic posture of the lead characters, especially the two in the foreground, reinforces the impression of movement. In comparison to Image A, where real skiers are captured mid-motion along the same path, the edited version maintains this sense of forward movement despite the stylization. The consistent directionality and pose alignment support the conclusion that the characters are still moving forward along the path.",
