        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog is constructed from interlocking plastic blocks (resembling LEGO bricks), forming a long, rectangular shape. The structure is clearly elongated and maintains a consistent straight alignment along its length, with no visible curves or bends. This design choice reflects a stylized, toy-like representation of a hot dog, but it still adheres to the general form of being elongated and straight. Based on visual cues, the object's geometry supports this interpretation. Using world knowledge, we know that real hot dogs are typically elongated and cylindrical, and even in abstract representations like this one, the intent is to preserve that fundamental shape. Therefore, despite the blocky construction, the overall form remains elongated and straight.",

      "question": "Is the hot dog placed horizontally on the wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog made of building blocks is positioned parallel to the edges of the wooden cutting board, which lies flat on the table. Its orientation runs from left to right across the frame, indicating a horizontal placement. From a spatial perspective, 'horizontal' means aligned with the horizon or parallel to the surface it rests on. Since the hot dog is lying flat and not tilted or vertical, it satisfies the definition of being horizontally placed. This conclusion is supported by the visual alignment of the object relative to the board and background elements, such as the window and wall, which provide directional context.",

      "question": "Are both the hot dog and the bottle placed on a flat wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog is placed on a wooden cutting board, which itself rests on a larger wooden table surface. The cutting board is flat and provides a stable platform for the hot dog. However, the object previously identified as a bottle in Image A has been replaced by a mosaic vase in Image B. This vase is also placed directly on the same wooden table surface, not on the cutting board. Therefore, while both objects rest on a wooden surface, they are not necessarily on the same immediate flat wooden base. The hot dog is on the cutting board (a raised wooden platform), whereas the vase is on the main table surface. Thus, although both are on wood, they are not on the same flat wooden surface in the strictest sense—especially since the cutting board is elevated slightly above the table. However, if 'flat wooden surface' refers broadly to any wooden plane, then yes, both are on wooden surfaces. But given the distinction between the cutting board and the table, and considering typical interpretations of 'surface,' the answer hinges on whether 'same surface' is implied. Since the question asks about both being on a flat wooden surface (not necessarily the same one), and both are indeed on wooden planes, the answer is Yes. The key point is that both are supported by flat wooden materials.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object that was a bottle in Image A has been replaced by a mosaic vase. This vase is located to the left of the hot dog when viewed from the front. The hot dog is on the right side of the wooden board, and the vase is on the left side of the same board. Therefore, the vase (formerly the bottle) is indeed to the left of the hot dog. Even though the original bottle is no longer present, the new object occupies the same relative position. Thus, based on spatial layout, the object now in the bottle’s place is to the left of the hot dog. The reasoning here relies on comparing the positions of the two central objects within the frame: the vase is on the left, the hot dog on the right. Hence, the answer is Yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog is situated on a wooden cutting board that is visibly elevated above the surrounding table surface. This cutting board serves as a raised platform, separating the hot dog from the main tabletop. The edge of the board is slightly higher than the table, creating a clear physical distinction. Additionally, shadows beneath the board suggest elevation. This observation aligns with common kitchen practices where cutting boards are used as temporary platforms for food items. Therefore, based on visual evidence of height difference and shadowing, the hot dog is indeed on a raised wooden platform distinct from the main table surface.",
