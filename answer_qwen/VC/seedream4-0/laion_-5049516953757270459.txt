    "Question": "Q1: Is the overall shape of the food arrangement a perfect heart?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of LEGO bricks forms a heart-shaped composition. The outline is clearly defined with a symmetrical structure that follows the general contours of a heart, including a pointed bottom and rounded top. While the edges are pixelated due to the blocky nature of LEGO bricks, the overall silhouette closely resembles a heart. However, 'perfect' implies flawless symmetry and smooth curves, which are not achievable with discrete LEGO pieces. The shape is stylized but not mathematically perfect. Given the medium (LEGO), it is reasonable to consider it a heart-shaped representation rather than a geometrically perfect one. Therefore, while it is intended to be a heart, the imperfections in curvature and symmetry due to the building blocks suggest it is not a perfect heart.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the avocado shown as half-cut with the pit cavity visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the avocado is constructed from green LEGO bricks arranged to mimic a halved avocado. The central part of the avocado is hollowed out using yellow and orange bricks, representing the pit cavity. This design matches the typical appearance of a sliced avocado with the seed removed. Although the texture is blocky, the visual cues—such as the concave center and the color contrast between the flesh and the pit area—are consistent with a half-cut avocado. Thus, despite the medium, the depiction accurately conveys the idea of a halved avocado with a visible pit cavity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the asparagus stalks bundled together with a visible twine-like structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the asparagus is represented by green LEGO bricks stacked vertically to resemble stalks. A thin, beige-colored LEGO piece wraps around the base of these stalks, mimicking the appearance of twine or string used to bundle fresh asparagus. This detail is consistent with how asparagus is commonly sold or presented in real life. The use of a distinct, lighter-colored brick to simulate twine adds realism to the model. Therefore, even though it is made of LEGO, the visual representation includes a twine-like structure binding the asparagus.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries grouped together at the top-left of the heart?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top-left region of the heart contains clusters of small round LEGO bricks in blue (blueberries), red (strawberries), and pinkish-red (raspberries). These are positioned close to each other, forming a compact group near the upper left curve of the heart. The placement mirrors the arrangement seen in the original image (Image A), where these fruits are clustered together. The grouping is intentional and visually coherent, suggesting they are meant to represent a fruit cluster. Thus, based on both visual layout and common culinary presentation, these fruits are indeed grouped together at the top-left.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is there a single red onion positioned near the broccoli and garlic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a purple LEGO structure resembling a red onion is located toward the right side of the heart, adjacent to a green broccoli-like structure and white garlic-like pieces. The onion is composed of layered purple bricks, mimicking the spherical shape and layered texture of a real red onion. Its position relative to the broccoli and garlic is consistent with the original image’s layout. Therefore, there is indeed a single red onion placed near the broccoli and garlic, as expected in a typical vegetable arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there at least three white mushrooms grouped together near the center?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, several white LEGO pieces shaped like mushrooms are clustered near the center-right portion of the heart. These include multiple white caps and stems, clearly designed to represent mushrooms. Counting them reveals at least three distinct mushroom structures grouped closely together. Their positioning and appearance align with the typical representation of mushrooms in a mixed vegetable display. Even though the form is simplified, the presence of three or more is evident from the visual layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a large red bell pepper at the bottom-right of the heart?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom-right section of the heart features a large red LEGO structure shaped like a bell pepper. It has a broad, curved body and a green stem, matching the typical appearance of a red bell pepper. Its size and position are consistent with being a prominent element in the lower right quadrant of the heart. This placement and design correspond to the original image, where a similar pepper is located. Therefore, yes, there is a large red bell pepper at the bottom-right.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the background a neutral gray surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the entire composition rests on a flat, uniform surface that is light gray in color. There are no patterns, textures, or variations in tone, indicating a plain, neutral background. This contrasts with Image A, which features a dark wooden plank background. The choice of a gray surface in Image B likely serves to emphasize the colorful LEGO construction without distraction. Since the background is consistently gray and lacks any additional elements, it qualifies as a neutral gray surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
