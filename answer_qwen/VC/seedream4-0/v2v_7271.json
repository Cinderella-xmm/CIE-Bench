      "question": "Is the word \"LAUNDROMAT\" clearly visible in white capital letters on a teal background above the entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sign above the entrance is constructed from LEGO bricks. The word 'LAUNDROMAT' is spelled out using white LEGO pieces with raised lettering, set against a teal-colored LEGO brick background. This matches the description of white capital letters on a teal background. The font and spacing are consistent with typical LEGO signage design, and the sign is positioned directly above the glass door entrance, as expected for a laundromat. Based on visual inspection and world knowledge of LEGO construction, the sign is clearly legible and properly placed.",

      "question": "Are there exactly six folded garments stacked in the following order from top to bottom: light blue, dusty rose, white, mustard yellow, medium blue, and dark gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stack of folded garments is made of LEGO bricks designed to resemble clothes. Counting from top to bottom, the colors are: light blue (top), dusty rose, white, mustard yellow, medium blue, and dark gray (bottom). Each layer corresponds to a single LEGO brick piece, and there are six distinct layers, matching the specified sequence. The color representation is accurate and consistent with the original image's clothing stack, though now stylized as LEGO blocks. The order and number align perfectly with the description.",

      "question": "Is the woman standing in front of the laundromat with both hands supporting the stack of laundry from underneath at waist level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figure is positioned in front of the laundromat entrance. Her arms are extended forward, and both hands are visibly holding the stack of LEGO garments from beneath. The stack is held at approximately waist level, consistent with how a person would carry folded laundry. The pose reflects natural human posture, adapted to LEGO proportions. The hands are correctly aligned under the stack, ensuring stability, which matches the described action.",

      "question": "Are two washing machines visible through the glass door, one with a circular door and the other partially visible behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Through the glass door in Image B, two washing machines can be seen inside the laundromat. The one closest to the viewer has a circular door, characteristic of standard front-loading washers. Behind it, another machine is partially visible, also featuring a circular door, though less of it is shown due to perspective. Both are built from LEGO elements and resemble real-world appliances. The arrangement and visibility match the description, with one fully visible and the other partially obscured.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left side of the scene features a wall constructed from tan or beige LEGO bricks arranged in a pattern that mimics a real brick wall. This wall extends vertically behind the LEGO figure, forming part of the building’s exterior. The texture and color are consistent with the original image's brickwork, though now rendered in LEGO form. The wall continues upward beyond the figure’s head, indicating vertical extension.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO figure in Image B is dressed in a rust-colored torso piece representing a long-sleeve sweater, with orange arms attached. The legs are blue LEGO pieces resembling jeans. While not fabric, the colors and shapes correspond directly to the described clothing: rust-colored top and blue pants. The design accurately reflects the outfit from the original image, translated into LEGO components. The style and color match the description precisely.",

      "question": "Is there a light gray concrete sidewalk visible in front of the laundromat, beneath the woman’s feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground beneath the LEGO figure consists of light gray LEGO baseplates with stud patterns, simulating a sidewalk. These baseplates extend horizontally in front of the laundromat entrance and are positioned directly under the figure’s feet. The color and texture mimic concrete, and the placement is consistent with a sidewalk in front of a building. Although it is a LEGO representation, it visually represents a light gray concrete sidewalk as described.",
