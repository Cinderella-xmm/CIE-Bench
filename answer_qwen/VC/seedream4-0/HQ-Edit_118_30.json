      "question": "Is the number \"1902\" clearly visible on the front of the locomotive?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the locomotive displays a circular black plate with white numerals. The numbers '1902' are clearly legible and positioned centrally on this plate, just below the smokestack. This placement is typical for steam locomotives, where identification numbers are prominently displayed for operational and historical purposes. The clarity of the digits is enhanced by high contrast between the white text and the dark background. Therefore, based on visual evidence and standard railway design practices, the number is clearly visible.",

      "question": "Does the locomotive retain a dominant green color on its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the locomotive's body is composed of multiple bright, block-like colors including yellow, blue, red, and green, arranged in a patchwork pattern resembling puzzle pieces. While green is present, it does not dominate the overall color scheme. Instead, the design appears stylized or abstract, possibly to reflect an artistic interpretation rather than realistic representation. In contrast, traditional steam locomotives like those from the early 20th century typically had a consistent primary color (such as green) across their bodies. Here, no single color dominates; thus, green is not the dominant hue.",

      "question": "Is the station building constructed from stone material with visible texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The station building in Image B has walls made of rectangular blocks that resemble stone masonry. These blocks have variations in tone and shading, suggesting depth and texture typical of natural stone construction. The presence of mortar lines between the blocks further supports the interpretation of stone material. Although the style is slightly stylized, the visual cues align with real-world stone buildings found in rural railway stations. Thus, based on architectural common sense and visual details, the structure appears to be made of textured stone.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof of the station building is depicted in flat, solid colors—green and beige—with no signs of organic growth such as moss. Moss typically appears as patches of green or grayish texture on damp surfaces, especially on older roofs. There are no such textures visible here. Additionally, the roof’s clean edges and uniform coloring suggest it is either newly maintained or artistically simplified. Given these observations and general knowledge about moss growth conditions, there is no indication of moss present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the platform in Image B, several objects resembling luggage can be seen. Specifically, near the seated passengers, there are two distinct items: one appears to be a brown trunk and another a dark blue suitcase. These are placed on the ground, consistent with how travelers would leave their belongings while waiting. Such trunks were common in early 20th-century travel, reinforcing the historical context. Their shape, size, and placement align with typical luggage used during that era. Therefore, based on both visual cues and historical knowledge, luggage trunks are indeed present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distant hilltop features multiple tall structures with three-bladed rotors mounted atop vertical poles—these are unmistakably modern wind turbines. They are evenly spaced and aligned in rows, which is characteristic of wind farms. Despite the anachronistic juxtaposition with the vintage train and clothing styles, the visual elements match real-world wind turbine designs. Their presence is clear and unambiguous, even though they contrast with the historical setting. Thus, based on visual recognition and engineering knowledge, wind turbines are visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The railway track in Image B begins straight in the foreground but gradually bends to the right as it recedes into the landscape. This curvature is evident through the alignment of the rails and sleepers, which follow a gentle arc. The track continues along the edge of the embankment, conforming to the terrain’s contours. Curved tracks are common in railway design to navigate hills and fields. The visual perspective confirms the curve, supported by the way the track diverges from a straight line as it moves farther away. Hence, the track is visibly curved.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two benches visible on the platform. Both appear to be made of wood, indicated by their grain-like texture, warm brown color, and classic bench design with slatted backs and seats. Passengers are seated on them, confirming their function. Wooden benches were standard at rural railway stations during the early 20th century due to their durability and low cost. The visual characteristics of these benches—shape, material appearance, and usage—are consistent with historical expectations. Therefore, wooden benches are present.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures on the platform in Image B are dressed in attire that reflects early 20th-century fashion. Men are wearing suits, waistcoats, and top hats, while women are in long dresses and bonnets or hats typical of that era. For example, one woman wears a long blue dress with a white apron and a blue hat, and several men sport bowler hats or top hats. These garments align with historical fashion trends from around 1900–1920. Even though the art style is stylized, the clothing choices remain faithful to period-appropriate silhouettes and accessories. Thus, the clothing is consistent with early 20th-century fashion.",
