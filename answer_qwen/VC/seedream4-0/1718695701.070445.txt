    "Question": "Q1: Is the capybara’s snout shape — including the rounded nose, wide mouth, and visible teeth — preserved in the sculpture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture depicts a capybara's head with a highly stylized and metallic finish. The snout is clearly defined with a rounded nose, a wide mouth, and visible teeth that are slightly parted, consistent with the expression seen in typical capybara representations. Despite being rendered in bronze, the sculptural form retains the essential anatomical features of the snout—particularly the broadness and the open mouth showing teeth—indicating that the key characteristics have been preserved in a stylized manner. This preservation aligns with common artistic practices where realistic proportions are maintained even when materials or styles change. Therefore, based on visual analysis and knowledge of animal anatomy and sculpture techniques, the snout shape is indeed preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the white muzzle area, positioned centrally on the face and extending from the nose to the upper lip, preserved in the sculpture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is made of bronze, which gives it a uniform metallic coloration. There is no distinct white area on the muzzle; instead, the entire surface is rendered in shades of brown and copper, consistent with the material. In contrast, Image A shows a real-looking capybara with a clearly visible white muzzle area centered on the face. Since the sculpture lacks any differentiation in color to represent the white patch, the white muzzle area is not preserved. This reflects a common characteristic in metal sculptures where color details from living animals are omitted due to material limitations. Thus, the white muzzle is absent in the sculpture.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the whiskers present and arranged in the same radial pattern from the snout as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the whiskers are depicted as fine, linear grooves etched into the bronze surface, radiating outward from the snout area. While they are present and arranged in a radial fashion similar to natural whisker patterns, they are stylized rather than realistic. In Image A, the whiskers are soft, fine, and naturally fanned out from the snout. Although both images show whiskers in a radial arrangement, the sculpture uses an artistic interpretation—engraved lines—rather than actual hair-like structures. However, the overall pattern and directionality are preserved. Given that the question asks whether the arrangement is the same, and considering the radial symmetry and placement relative to the snout, the answer is affirmative in terms of spatial layout, even if not in texture or material.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the glasses positioned directly over the eyes, with the frame aligned horizontally across the bridge of the nose?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glasses are part of the bronze sculpture and are mounted directly over the eye sockets. The frame appears to be aligned horizontally across the bridge of the nose, maintaining a symmetrical and balanced position. The glasses are integrated into the design with precision, suggesting intentional alignment. In Image A, the glasses are also worn directly over the eyes with horizontal alignment. Comparing both images, the positioning of the glasses in the sculpture matches the original in terms of placement and orientation. Even though the material differs (plastic vs. bronze), the spatial relationship between the glasses and the facial features remains consistent. Thus, the alignment is preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the sweater and shoulder straps positioned on the shoulders and torso in the same way as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows only the head and neck of the capybara, with no visible torso or clothing beyond the base of the neck. The sweater and shoulder straps seen in Image A are completely absent in the sculpture. The sculpture focuses solely on the head, placed on a marble pedestal, and does not include any lower body elements or attire. Therefore, the sweater and shoulder straps are not present in Image B, making it impossible for them to be positioned in the same way. This omission is likely due to the nature of a bust-style sculpture, which typically excludes the lower body. Based on this, the answer is clear.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the capybara’s head shape — rounded, broad, and proportionally large relative to the body — preserved in the sculpture?",
    "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B captures the capybara’s head as rounded and broad, consistent with the species' natural anatomy. The head is proportionally large compared to what would be expected for a full-bodied representation, though the body itself is not shown. Since the sculpture is a bust, it emphasizes the head, which is typical in portrait-style art. The width and curvature of the head are accurately represented in relation to the neck base, preserving the general proportions seen in real capybaras. While the absence of the body makes direct proportional comparison difficult, the head’s shape is faithful to the original in terms of roundness and breadth. Thus, the head shape is preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the mouth depicted as slightly open, revealing the teeth, in the same manner as the original?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mouth is clearly sculpted to be slightly open, with the upper and lower teeth visible, mirroring the expression in Image A. The lips are parted just enough to reveal the dental structure, and the shape of the mouth is consistent with a relaxed, open-mouthed expression. This detail is carefully rendered in the bronze, with attention to the contours of the lips and the spacing of the teeth. Comparing to Image A, the degree of openness and the visibility of the teeth are nearly identical. The sculpture maintains this expressive feature despite the material difference, indicating that the artist intended to preserve this aspect of the capybara’s appearance. Therefore, the mouth depiction is preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"
