      "question": "Is the two-tiered roof with upward-curving eaves and ornamental ridge details preserved in the same structural outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building retains a two-tiered roof structure with upward-curving eaves, which is characteristic of traditional Japanese architecture. The overall silhouette and tiered form are consistent with the original architectural style seen in Image A. Although the artistic style has shifted to a stained-glass-like aesthetic, the structural outline—including the layered roofs, curved eaves, and decorative ridge elements—remains faithful to the original design. This preservation is evident through the clear segmentation of roof levels and the continuity of the roofline shape, even though the material representation is stylized. Based on visual cues and world knowledge of Japanese temple architecture, the core structural features are maintained despite stylistic abstraction.",

      "question": "Is the large red moon positioned in the upper center of the sky and retaining its dominant red color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is clearly depicted as a large, circular object located in the upper central portion of the sky. Its dominant red color is preserved, though it is now rendered in a segmented, geometric style reminiscent of stained glass. Despite this stylistic transformation, the moon remains the focal point of the sky and maintains its red hue, consistent with the 'blood moon' motif seen in Image A. The placement and color are intentionally emphasized, aligning with the symbolic and aesthetic importance of the moon in the scene. Therefore, both position and color are retained, albeit in a stylized form.",

      "question": "Are there two red-colored trees symmetrically placed on the left and right sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two prominent red trees are visible—one on the left and one on the right side of the building. These trees are stylistically rendered with bold red leaves and branching structures that mirror each other in form and placement, suggesting intentional symmetry. The visual balance between the two trees contributes to the composition's harmony, a common feature in traditional Japanese garden design. While the rendering is abstracted into geometric shapes, their positions relative to the central building remain symmetrical, just as in Image A. Thus, the symmetry and color of the trees are preserved in the edited version.",

      "question": "Is there a reflective body of water in the foreground mirroring the building and moon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a body of water is present in the foreground, and it clearly reflects the building, the red trees, and the moon. The reflection is stylized but recognizable, with mirrored patterns of the building’s structure, the red foliage, and the segmented red moon. The water surface is depicted with horizontal lines and color gradients that suggest stillness and reflection, consistent with the serene atmosphere of the scene. Even though the reflection is not photorealistic, it accurately conveys the concept of mirroring, which is a key element in both images. Therefore, the presence and function of the reflective water are preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a set of stone steps is visible leading down from the building’s platform toward the water. These steps are composed of rectangular blocks arranged in a descending pattern, consistent with traditional Japanese garden pathways. The steps are clearly defined and connect the elevated platform of the building to the lower level near the pond. The design matches the architectural context and functional purpose seen in Image A, where such steps provide access to the water feature. Despite the stylized rendering, the presence and layout of the steps are unmistakable.",

      "question": "Are the windows on the building emitting a warm orange light, particularly on the upper and lower levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows of the building are filled with colored glass segments, and while they do not emit light in a realistic sense, they are rendered in warm hues such as orange, yellow, and amber. These colors suggest illumination from within, mimicking the glow of lit interiors seen in Image A. The upper and lower levels both contain these warm-toned panels, indicating an intentional representation of internal lighting. Although the effect is stylized rather than photorealistic, the artistic choice preserves the impression of warmth and interior light, aligning with the mood and atmosphere of the original image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area around the base of the building and along the edge of the pond is filled with stylized green forms that represent low shrubs and manicured plants. These elements are rendered in various shades of green with textured patterns that suggest carefully trimmed foliage, typical of Japanese garden landscaping. Their placement around the building and water creates a natural frame, consistent with traditional design principles. While abstracted into geometric shapes, the visual cues clearly indicate the presence of such vegetation, maintaining the garden-like setting seen in Image A.",
