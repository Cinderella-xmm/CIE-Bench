    "Question": "Q1: Is the person's raised hand with an open palm still present in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the person is depicted in a cartoon style, but their right hand is clearly raised with an open palm, mirroring the pose from the original image. The gesture is exaggerated slightly due to the stylized art form, but the open-palm position remains consistent with the original. This can be confirmed by observing the hand's orientation and fingers spread apart, which aligns with the action of waving or signaling. Given that the overall composition and posture are preserved in the cartoon version, the presence of the raised hand with an open palm is maintained.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is there still a wooden-framed mirror visible in the bathroom background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes a mirror with a distinct wooden frame, positioned on the wall above the sink. Although the style is simplified and cartoonish, the rectangular shape and wood-textured border are clearly identifiable as a mirror with a wooden frame. The reflection in the mirror also shows part of the room, reinforcing its function as a mirror. This matches the original setup seen in Image A, where a similar wooden-framed mirror was present. The artistic transformation does not remove this key element, so it remains visible.",
