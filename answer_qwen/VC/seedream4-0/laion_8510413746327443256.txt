    "Question": "Q1: Is the display of the device rectangular with rounded corners?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the display is clearly visible and has a rectangular shape with smoothly rounded corners. This is consistent with the design language of modern smartwatches, where screens are typically rectangular to maximize display area while maintaining ergonomic comfort. The edges of the screen are not sharp or square but gently curved, which aligns with common design practices for wearable devices. The black bezel surrounding the screen further emphasizes this shape. Based on visual cues, the display is rectangular with rounded corners.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the digital crown positioned on the right side of the watch case?",
    "explanation": "The digital crown in Image B is located on the right side of the watch case, just as it would be on a standard Apple Watch. It is a prominent circular knob with a textured surface, glowing with a blue light, indicating its function as an input mechanism. Its position matches the typical placement on such devices, allowing users to interact with the interface using their thumb. This placement is consistent with real-world smartwatch designs, particularly those from Apple, where the digital crown is always on the right side.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a small button located below the digital crown on the right side of the case?",
    "explanation": "Below the digital crown on the right side of the watch case in Image B, there is indeed a small, elongated button. This button is metallic and flush with the side of the case, consistent with the side button found on Apple Watches. In real-world devices, this button is used for functions like powering on/off or accessing Siri. The presence of this button directly beneath the digital crown is a hallmark of Apple Watch design. Therefore, based on both visual evidence and world knowledge of smartwatch anatomy, this feature is present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the ends of the band attached to the left and right sides of the watch case?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the band appears to be connected to the watch case at both the left and right sides. The mechanical structure of the band wraps around the case, with visible attachment points on each side. Although the band is stylized as a dragon, the functional connection points remain consistent with how wristbands attach to smartwatches—on the left and right lugs of the case. This is standard for all wrist-worn timepieces, including smartwatches, ensuring secure fastening and proper fit. Thus, the ends of the band are attached to both sides of the case.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the screen facing directly forward, perpendicular to the wrist?",
    "explanation": "The screen in Image B is oriented so that it faces directly forward, as if worn on a wrist. The angle of the display relative to the band suggests it is designed to be viewed straight-on when worn. This orientation is typical for smartwatches, where the screen must be readable without requiring the user to tilt their wrist excessively. Even though the band is fantastical (a dragon), the display's positioning remains consistent with ergonomic design principles for wearable tech. Therefore, the screen is facing forward, perpendicular to the intended wearing position.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the watch case have a slim, compact profile with minimal depth?",
    "explanation": "Although the watch case in Image B is heavily stylized with mechanical and dragon-like elements, its overall profile still appears relatively slim and compact compared to bulkier designs. The case does not extend significantly outward from the band, and the thickness seems consistent with modern smartwatches, despite the added fantasy aesthetics. While the digital crown and side button are prominent, they do not suggest excessive depth. From a structural perspective, even with enhancements, the case maintains a form factor suitable for wrist wear. Hence, it can be considered to have a slim, compact profile.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there multiple adjustment holes along the length of the band?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the band is designed as a metallic dragon with scales and mechanical joints, rather than a traditional fabric or silicone strap. However, despite the fantastical design, there are visible perforations along the length of the band, particularly near the tail end, which resemble adjustment holes. These holes are spaced evenly and appear to serve the same purpose as those on regular watch bands—allowing the wearer to adjust the fit. While not conventional, the presence of these openings indicates an intentional design for size adjustment. Therefore, yes, there are multiple adjustment holes along the band.",
    "answer": "Yes"
