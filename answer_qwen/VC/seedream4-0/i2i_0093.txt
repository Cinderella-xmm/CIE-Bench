    "Question": "Q1: Does the smartphone retain its rectangular shape with rounded edges?",
    "explanation": "The smartphone in Image B has a clearly defined rectangular form with smoothly curved corners, which is consistent with the typical design of modern smartphones. The edges are not sharp but gently rounded, especially noticeable at the top and bottom corners. This shape is standard for most smartphones to provide ergonomic handling and aesthetic appeal. Based on visual inspection, there are no distortions or irregularities in the outline that would suggest a deviation from this common design. Therefore, the phone retains its rectangular shape with rounded edges.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the home button visible and located at the bottom center of the phone?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a circular button is clearly visible at the bottom center of the smartphone's front face. This button is positioned directly below the screen and is consistent in appearance with the home button found on older iPhone models (such as the iPhone 8 or earlier). Its placement and design—being a physical, slightly raised circular element—are characteristic of a home button used for navigation and unlocking the device. There is no indication of it being replaced by a fingerprint sensor or other interface, so it is both visible and correctly located.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the charging cable visibly connected to the phone's charging port and leading to the charging pad?",
    "explanation": "The image shows a black charging cable with a connector inserted into the bottom port of the smartphone. The cable extends from the phone toward the right side of the frame and connects to a circular wireless charging pad beneath the phone. The alignment and continuity of the cable suggest it is physically linked to both the phone and the pad. While the connection point to the pad is partially obscured, the visual path of the cable and its integration with the setup confirm that it is connected to both ends. This configuration is typical for wired charging setups, even when paired with wireless pads for convenience or dual functionality.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the phone still placed flat on top of the charging pad?",
    "explanation": "The smartphone in Image B appears to be resting horizontally on the circular charging pad. The entire back surface of the phone makes contact with the pad, and there is no visible tilt or elevation at any edge. The shadow beneath the phone is uniform, suggesting even contact with the surface. Additionally, the phone's orientation aligns with the pad’s circular shape, indicating stable placement. Given these visual cues and the typical usage scenario where phones are placed flat for optimal charging, the phone is indeed placed flat on the charging pad.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the background a solid green color without any additional elements?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is uniformly green across the entire frame. There are no patterns, textures, objects, or variations in color that would indicate additional elements. The lighting is even, and the green tone remains consistent, suggesting a controlled studio environment often used in product photography. This simplicity helps emphasize the phone and charging setup without distraction. No other items such as text, logos, or reflections from external sources are present. Therefore, the background is a solid green color with no additional elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
