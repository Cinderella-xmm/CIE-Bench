      "question": "Is the “GIOROUR” logo clearly visible on the balance beam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balance beam is depicted in a stylized, illustrated format. The central panel shows a gymnast standing on the beam, and the beam itself has a black oval plaque with text on it. Upon close inspection, the text appears to read 'GIOROUR', which matches the logo mentioned in the question. The font style and placement are consistent with branding typically seen on gymnastics equipment. Although the image is cartoonish, the letters are legible and clearly spelled out. Therefore, based on visual evidence and common knowledge that such logos are often displayed prominently on sports equipment, the logo is indeed visible.",

      "question": "Is the gymnast positioned with both feet firmly on the surface of the balance beam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central illustration shows the gymnast standing upright on the balance beam. Both feet are placed flat on the beam's surface, with no indication of imbalance or movement. The posture suggests stability, and the positioning of the feet aligns with standard gymnastic form when balancing. Given that the image is a static representation, and both feet are visibly in contact with the beam, it can be concluded that both feet are firmly on the surface.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balance beam is shown resting on a blue support structure. Beneath the beam, there is a visible blue surface extending outward, which represents the floor mat used in gymnastics to provide cushioning and safety. This blue area is consistent with the color and placement of standard gym mats. While the illustration is simplified, the presence of this blue surface directly under the beam indicates that the floor mat is visible.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right support leg of the balance beam is shown in detail. On this leg, there is a small white label with black text. The text reads 'GOTS', which matches the logo mentioned in the question. The label is clearly legible and positioned in a way typical for manufacturer or certification branding on sports equipment. Based on the visual clarity and standard labeling practices, the 'GOTS' logo is present and visible.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is limited to three framed illustrations, each showing a single gymnast on a balance beam. There are no other gymnasts depicted in the background or surrounding areas of any of the panels. The setting is focused solely on individual performances, and no secondary figures are present. Therefore, despite the artistic nature of the image, no additional gymnasts are visible.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central gymnast’s hair is tied up in a neat bun at the top of her head. A small red accessory is visible securing the bun, consistent with a hair tie. This is a common hairstyle for gymnasts during competition to keep hair secure. The red color is distinct against the dark hair, making it easily identifiable. Based on visual cues and typical gymnastic attire, the description matches the image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balance beam is supported by two distinct blue structures at either end. These supports are angled and connected to the beam, forming a stable base. The design is consistent with standard balance beam setups in gymnastics, where two legs provide balance and support. The blue color matches the floor mat and is typical for such equipment. Thus, the beam rests on two blue support legs.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of plain beige walls and a wooden frame holding the illustrations. There is no depiction of a stadium, seating, or spectators. Unlike Image A, which includes a crowd in bleachers, Image B is an indoor display of artwork with no audience present. Therefore, based on the visual content, spectators are not visible.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the balance beam is a plain, neutral-colored wall with no logos, emblems, or text. There is no dark blue wall, nor any mention of 'Giptorht' or a green circular emblem. This contrasts with Image A, which features such elements, but in Image B, these details are absent. The scene is minimalist and focused on the gymnast, without any branding or environmental details beyond the immediate setup.",
