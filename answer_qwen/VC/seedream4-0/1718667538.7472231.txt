    "Question": "Q1: Is the tiger mask clearly defined with orange and black stripes arranged in a typical tiger pattern?",
    "explanation": "The tiger mask in Image B is crafted in a stylized, paper-art form, featuring bold orange and black stripes that follow the natural pattern of a tiger's facial markings. The stripes are symmetrical and extend from the forehead down to the cheeks, mimicking the characteristic 'M' shape on the forehead and curving around the eyes and snout. These visual elements align with common depictions of tigers in art and nature, where orange and black stripes are dominant and arranged in a flowing, curved manner. The use of layered paper gives depth to the design, enhancing the definition of the stripes. Based on this analysis, the mask clearly reflects a typical tiger stripe pattern.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are pink cherry blossoms with black branch outlines visible on the kimono?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining the kimono in Image B, it features floral patterns consistent with cherry blossoms. The flowers are rendered in shades of pink, and the branches are depicted in dark tones, likely black or deep brown, which stand out against the lighter background of the fabric. These elements are typical of traditional Japanese textile designs, especially those associated with springtime motifs. The arrangement of blossoms along thin, angular branches further supports the identification as cherry blossoms. Therefore, the presence of pink cherry blossoms with black branch outlines is evident on the kimono.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the tiger mask show an open mouth with visible fangs?",
    "explanation": "The tiger mask in Image B is designed with an open mouth, revealing sharp white fangs that are prominently displayed. The mouth is slightly agape, creating a fierce expression typical of tiger masks in artistic representations. The fangs are clearly defined and positioned symmetrically on both sides of the lower jaw, consistent with anatomical accuracy and stylistic exaggeration seen in animal masks. This feature enhances the dramatic effect of the mask, suggesting aggression or power. Thus, the open mouth with visible fangs is present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a red obi with horizontal bands wrapped around the waist of the figure?",
    "explanation": "The obi (sash) in Image B is indeed red and features distinct horizontal bands. These bands are evenly spaced and run across the width of the obi, giving it a structured and decorative appearance. The texture and layering suggest a ribbon-like material, typical of traditional Japanese obi styles. The horizontal banding is a key visual element, contributing to the overall aesthetic of the garment. This matches the description of a red obi with horizontal bands, confirming its presence.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the subject positioned directly facing the viewer in a seated posture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is shown from the chest up, with the head and upper body oriented straight toward the camera. The posture appears upright and centered, indicating a direct frontal view. However, there is no visible indication of legs or feet that would confirm a seated position; instead, the lower portion of the figure seems to be integrated into a display structure resembling a paper diorama. Given the context—where the figure appears to be part of a crafted scene rather than a living person—the positioning suggests a static, posed presentation rather than a natural seated posture. While the face is facing forward, the lack of visible seating cues makes it ambiguous whether the subject is truly seated. Therefore, based on visual evidence, the subject is not clearly in a seated posture.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q6: Are pink cherry blossoms hanging from above in the background?",
    "explanation": "The background of Image B features numerous pink floral clusters suspended from above by thin strings or threads. These clusters resemble cherry blossoms, commonly used in Japanese cultural decorations, especially during spring festivals. The way they hang downward and are spaced vertically aligns with traditional shide or wind chime arrangements found in temples and gardens. Their color and shape match the aesthetic of cherry blossoms, reinforcing their identity. Thus, pink cherry blossoms are visibly hanging from above in the background.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the kimono primarily cream-colored with pink floral patterns?",
    "explanation": "The kimono in Image B has a base color that is light, almost off-white or cream, which serves as a neutral backdrop for the decorative elements. Overlaid on this base are floral patterns in shades of pink, consistent with cherry blossoms. These pink flowers are distributed across the fabric in a repeating pattern, adding vibrancy without overpowering the primary color. The combination of a cream background with pink floral motifs is typical of many traditional kimonos, especially those designed for spring occasions. Therefore, the kimono is accurately described as primarily cream-colored with pink floral patterns.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are there black trim lines along the edges of the kimono and obi?",
    "explanation": "The kimono in Image B includes black trim along its outer edges, particularly visible along the sleeves and collar area. Additionally, the obi (sash) has a black border running along its top edge, contrasting with the red central portion. This black trim is consistent with traditional Japanese garment design, where contrasting borders add definition and elegance. The presence of these black lines at key junctions of the garment confirms the existence of black trim lines along the edges of both the kimono and obi.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q9: Do the tiger mask’s ears have an upright shape with orange inner surfaces?",
    "explanation": "The ears of the tiger mask in Image B are clearly upright and pointed, matching the natural ear posture of a tiger. Inside each ear, the surface is colored orange, which contrasts with the white exterior. This detail adds realism to the mask, as real tiger ears often have darker inner fur, though here it is stylized with orange to complement the overall color scheme. The combination of upright shape and orange interior aligns with both biological accuracy and artistic representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q10: Is there white fur surrounding the tiger’s muzzle and cheeks?",
    "explanation": "The tiger mask in Image B features a white area around the muzzle and cheeks, which is consistent with the natural coloring of a tiger’s face. This white region extends from the nose upward toward the eyes and outward along the cheekbones, providing contrast to the orange and black stripes. In the context of the paper-crafted style, this white area is represented through layered paper cutouts, giving it a textured, furry appearance. This detail enhances the realism of the mask, even within a stylized medium. Therefore, white fur-like areas are present around the muzzle and cheeks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
