      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is still prominently displayed with a bright yellow color, consistent with the typical appearance of ripe mangoes. The fruit has been cut into cubes in a grid-like pattern, which is a common way to prepare mango for eating or serving. This cubed arrangement is clearly visible and maintains the same structure as in the original image. The visual cues—such as the uniform size and alignment of the cubes—support that the mango retains both its yellow color and cubed form. Although the lighting appears more intense and reflective, suggesting a stylized or cartoonish rendering, the core attributes of color and shape remain unchanged. Thus, based on world knowledge of mango presentation and visual analysis, the yellow color and cubed arrangement are preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime is depicted as half-sliced, showing its internal segments, which is consistent with how limes are typically presented when used in food preparation. The outer peel remains green, matching the expected color of a fresh lime. However, upon closer inspection, the lime has been stylized with cartoonish features: it has eyes and a smiling face drawn on its surface, which deviates from a realistic representation. Despite this anthropomorphization, the lime's green color and sliced form are still recognizable. The internal structure shows the characteristic radial pattern of lime segments. Therefore, while the aesthetic has been altered for humor or artistic effect, the essential visual traits—the green color and sliced appearance—are retained. World knowledge confirms that even stylized versions of fruits often preserve key identifying features for recognition.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the orange-red color and granular texture of the chili powder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chili powder is contained in a small wooden bowl and displays a vivid orange-red hue, which aligns with the typical color of ground chili powder. The texture appears granular and slightly coarse, consistent with the physical properties of powdered spices. While the bowl itself has been given cartoonish facial features (eyes, cheeks, and a smile), the contents remain visually similar to real chili powder. The particles are not overly smooth or liquid-like, nor do they appear fused or distorted. Based on world knowledge, chili powder is generally finely ground but not perfectly uniform, and this image reflects that texture accurately. Thus, despite the playful design of the container, the chili powder’s color and texture are faithfully represented.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the relative positions of the objects on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layout of the objects on the plate closely mirrors that of the original image. The cubed mango occupies the left side of the plate, the whole mango is positioned behind it toward the right, the halved lime is placed in front of the mango, and the bowl of chili powder is situated next to the lime. These spatial relationships are preserved: the mango is still adjacent to the whole fruit, the lime is near the center-front, and the chili powder is in the lower-right quadrant. Even though the background has changed (from a wooden table to a shelf), the relative placement of each item remains consistent. This suggests that the editor maintained the compositional structure for visual coherence, even if other elements were stylized. World knowledge about food presentation supports that such arrangements are deliberate and meaningful, and their retention indicates continuity in design intent.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plate appears to have a wooden texture, with visible grain patterns and a warm brown tone that suggest it is made of wood or a wood-like material. While the overall rendering may be slightly smoother or more polished than in the original image, the surface still exhibits characteristics typical of wood—such as subtle variations in color and texture that mimic natural grain. The edges are rounded, and the thickness appears consistent with a wooden plate. There is no indication of a plastic or ceramic finish that would contradict the wooden appearance. Although the lighting and shading are more exaggerated, possibly due to digital enhancement, the fundamental texture remains identifiable as wood. Therefore, based on visual cues and world knowledge about materials used in food presentation, the wooden texture of the plate is retained.",
