      "question": "Are the printed texts on both open pages still clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the printed text on both open pages is visible, though the lighting appears to be slightly dimmer compared to typical reading conditions. The text is legible enough to discern individual lines and paragraphs, especially in the central region of the pages. However, due to the angle and soft shadows cast by the lighting, some areas near the edges of the pages are less distinct. Nevertheless, based on visual cues such as consistent font size, spacing, and alignment, and combining this with world knowledge that books typically have readable text when properly illuminated, it can be concluded that the text remains clearly visible overall. There are no signs of blurring, distortion, or overexposure that would obscure the content.",

      "question": "Is the book cover still visibly pinkish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The book cover in Image B shows a soft, pastel hue along the spine and outer edges, which is consistent with a pinkish tone. This coloration is visible despite the warm lighting and shadows. Based on world knowledge, book covers often retain their original color unless altered by wear or digital editing. In this case, there is no evidence of color alteration or fading; the pinkish tint is subtle but present, particularly noticeable at the top edge of the spine and the outer binding. Therefore, the cover maintains its pinkish appearance.",

      "question": "Is the wooden background with its natural texture and grain patterns intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden surface beneath the book in Image B displays clear wood grain patterns, including variations in color and texture typical of natural wood. The planks show distinct lines and knots, which are characteristic features of real wood. The lighting enhances these details, especially in the areas not directly under the book. There are no signs of artificial smoothing, uniformity, or digital manipulation that would suggest the texture has been altered. Combining visual cues with world knowledge about wooden surfaces, it is evident that the natural texture and grain patterns remain intact.",

      "question": "Is the book still open with the pages aligned logically on the wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is positioned open on the wooden surface, with the left and right pages spread out in a natural, symmetrical manner. The spine is centered, and the pages lie flat without significant curling or misalignment. The book's orientation suggests it was placed intentionally for display or reading, with the pages resting evenly on the surface. This arrangement is consistent with how books are typically opened and displayed. There is no indication of forced positioning or unnatural angles. Thus, the alignment of the pages appears logical and physically plausible.",

      "question": "Do the pages retain their beige color and slightly aged texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pages in Image B exhibit a light beige tone, which is common in older or vintage books. This coloration is consistent across both pages and matches the expected appearance of aged paper. Additionally, the texture of the pages shows subtle variations in thickness and slight irregularities at the edges, suggesting an authentic, slightly worn quality. These characteristics align with world knowledge about paper aging and printing materials. There is no sign of whitening or excessive yellowing that would indicate over-editing or artificial aging. Therefore, the pages retain their beige color and slightly aged texture.",
