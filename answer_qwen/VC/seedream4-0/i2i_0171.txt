    "Question": "Q1: Is the skier’s dynamic skiing pose, including bent knees and forward lean, retained in the figurine?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is positioned in a crouched stance with knees bent and body leaning forward, which is characteristic of an active skiing posture. This pose mimics the balance and aerodynamic form used by skiers during descent to maintain control and speed. The arms are extended outward, holding ski poles, further reinforcing the sense of motion and stability typical in skiing. Based on visual cues such as the angle of the torso, knee flexion, and overall body alignment, the figurine accurately captures the dynamic skiing pose. Comparing this to Image A, where the real skier is also shown in a similar bent-knee, forward-leaning position while carving through snow, confirms that the figurine faithfully reproduces the essential elements of the pose. Therefore, the dynamic skiing posture is preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the skier's helmet and reflective goggles visible on the figurine?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine clearly features a black helmet covering the head, consistent with standard ski safety gear. Additionally, the face is equipped with reflective goggles that have a colorful lens, matching the style commonly worn by skiers for eye protection against glare and wind. These accessories are distinctly visible and properly proportioned relative to the figurine's head. In Image A, the actual skier also wears a black helmet and reflective goggles, confirming that these items are part of the original subject’s attire. The figurine maintains this detail accurately, ensuring both functional and aesthetic fidelity to the source image. Thus, the helmet and goggles are indeed visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the skis still attached to the figurine, showing their placement under the skier’s feet?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine has two skis securely attached beneath its feet, aligned parallel to each other and angled slightly outward, which is typical for downhill skiing stances. The skis appear fixed to the boots, indicating proper attachment and realistic positioning. The design includes red edges along the skis, adding visual detail. In Image A, the skier is similarly equipped with skis attached to their boots, actively carving through snow. The figurine replicates this setup precisely, preserving the correct anatomical relationship between the skier and the equipment. Hence, the skis are not only present but correctly placed under the feet.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the figurine showcase a snow spray effect around it to mimic the motion of skiing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is mounted on a circular base covered with artificial snow, simulating a snowy surface. However, there is no visible snow spray or cloud-like dispersion around the skis or legs that would indicate motion. Snow spray is typically created when skis carve through fresh powder, kicking up snow behind and beside the skier. While Image A vividly displays such a spray effect—evident from the plume of snow being displaced by the skier’s movement—the figurine lacks this dynamic element due to its static nature. Since the figurine is a collectible item designed for display rather than motion simulation, it does not include an actual snow spray effect. Therefore, the motion-mimicking feature is absent.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the skier’s outfit, consisting of a blue jacket and black pants, accurately represented on the figurine?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is dressed in a dark blue jacket with visible zippers and seams, closely resembling the one worn by the skier in Image A. The pants are black and fitted, consistent with typical ski wear. The color scheme and style match the original skier’s outfit, including details like the backpack straps over the shoulders. The figurine preserves the key elements of the clothing—color, cut, and layering—indicating accurate representation. Given that both images show the same individual in similar attire, and the figurine maintains those characteristics, the outfit is faithfully reproduced.",
    "answer": "Yes"
