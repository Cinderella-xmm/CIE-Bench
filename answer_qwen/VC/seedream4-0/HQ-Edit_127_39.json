      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure that resembles the Eiffel Tower has been transformed into a futuristic, humanoid figure with a crown and glowing neon patterns. The original four-legged base and central archway of the Eiffel Tower are no longer present. Instead, the base is replaced by a wide, circular platform with illuminated pixel-like blocks, and the structure itself is now a vertical, anthropomorphic form. Therefore, the classic four-legged base with a central archway is absent in this edited version. This conclusion is drawn from visual analysis: the architectural elements that define the Eiffel Towerâ€™s base are replaced by a new design, indicating a complete transformation.",

      "question": "Is the classical-style building visible through the central arch of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no central archway present as seen in the original Eiffel Tower. The structure is now a tall, humanoid monument with a solid, enclosed body, and the space where the arch would be is filled with internal circuitry and glowing designs. As a result, there is no opening through which any background building can be seen. In contrast, in Image A (the original), the central archway does allow visibility of the classical-style building (likely the Palais de Chaillot) behind it. Since Image B lacks this archway entirely, the building cannot be seen through it. This comparison relies on recognizing the structural differences between the original and the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the symmetrical rows of trimmed green hedges present along both sides of the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground still features neatly trimmed green hedges arranged symmetrically along both sides of the open grassy area. These hedges are illuminated from within or below, casting a soft glow, and they maintain the same geometric shape and alignment as in Image A. Despite the dramatic transformation of the central tower, the surrounding landscape remains largely unchanged. This continuity suggests that the hedges were preserved during the edit to maintain environmental context. Visual cues such as consistent spacing, shape, and lighting confirm their presence.",

      "question": "Are there people visible sitting or walking on the grassy field in front of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple small human figures can be observed scattered across the grassy field in front of the tower. Some are sitting in groups, others appear to be lying down, and a few are walking. Their positions and postures suggest casual leisure activity, similar to what might be seen in a public park. The scale of these figures relative to the tower confirms they are people, and their presence is consistent with the scene's setting as a public space. This matches the typical use of the Champ de Mars, reinforcing the realism of the scene despite the fantastical tower.",

      "question": "Is the sky gradient transitioning from deep blue at the top to orange near the horizon present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky displays a clear gradient, transitioning smoothly from a deep blue at the upper portion to a warm orange hue near the horizon. This color progression is characteristic of twilight or early evening, commonly seen in sunset scenes. The gradient is consistent with natural atmospheric lighting conditions and is visually identical to that in Image A. This suggests that the sky was preserved during the editing process, likely to maintain a sense of realism and continuity in the environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hedges along both sides of the foreground are visibly illuminated by embedded lights. These lights appear as bright, glowing spots or patches on the surface of the hedges, creating a subtle luminous effect. The lighting enhances the texture and form of the hedges and contributes to the overall ambiance of the scene. This detail is consistent with modern landscape lighting techniques often used in urban parks. The glowing effect is clearly visible and adds to the futuristic aesthetic of the image, even though the hedges themselves remain structurally unchanged.",
