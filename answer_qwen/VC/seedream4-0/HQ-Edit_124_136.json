      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is seated on a stone bench with both legs extended forward and resting on the ground. The posture is upright and formal, not cross-legged. The legs are positioned parallel to each other, and there is no indication of one leg being crossed over the other. This contrasts with typical cross-legged seating, where the feet are tucked beneath the opposite thighs. Based on visual cues, the figure is not seated in a cross-legged position.",

      "question": "Is the right hand positioned above the strings in a plucking gesture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's right hand is placed near the strings of the harp-like instrument, with fingers slightly curved as if preparing to pluck or strum. The hand is located directly above the strings, and the positioning suggests an active engagement with the instrument. The thumb and index finger appear poised for plucking, consistent with traditional harp-playing technique. Therefore, the hand is indeed positioned in a plucking gesture.",

      "question": "Is the left hand positioned on the neck of the instrument with fingers pressing the strings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure’s left hand is gripping the upper part of the instrument’s frame, near the tuning pegs. However, it is not positioned on the neck in a way that suggests pressing strings. Instead, it appears to be holding or stabilizing the instrument. The fingers are not shown pressing down on any strings, which would be necessary for fretting or changing pitch. Thus, the left hand is not engaged in string pressing.",

      "question": "Is the figure facing forward with the head slightly tilted upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is turned slightly to the right (from the viewer's perspective), looking toward the right side of the image. The head is not tilted upward but rather held in a neutral, downward-facing orientation relative to the gaze. The facial expression and posture suggest contemplation or focus on the instrument, but not an upward tilt. Therefore, the figure is not facing forward with a slight upward tilt.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the figure in Image B clearly has a long, full white beard and mustache. The beard extends well below the chin and flows down the chest, while the mustache is thick and prominent, curling at the ends. These features are characteristic of elderly male figures often depicted in religious or historical art, such as King David or prophets. The hair and facial hair are rendered with fine detail, emphasizing their length and texture.",

      "question": "Is the figure wearing a brown, textured turban?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is wearing a headdress that resembles a mosaic-patterned head covering, richly decorated with intricate designs and possibly symbolic inscriptions. It is not a simple brown, textured turban but rather a more elaborate, ornate garment made of what appears to be tessellated material, suggesting a mosaic style. The color palette includes gold, blue, red, and other hues, and the texture is highly detailed, unlike a plain turban. Therefore, the description of a 'brown, textured turban' does not accurately reflect the actual headwear.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the instrument is a harp-like structure with a large, curved body. The front surface of the instrument, where the strings are attached, shows a decorative, possibly wooden or metallic surface with visible patterns and inscriptions. This area serves as the soundboard, which amplifies the vibrations of the strings. The presence of a resonant chamber and the arrangement of strings confirm that this is the soundboard region. It is clearly visible and central to the instrument’s design.",
