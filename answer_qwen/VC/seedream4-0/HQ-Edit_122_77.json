      "question": "Are the pink peony flowers with yellow centers still present in the hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair is adorned with a floral crown composed of various flowers and greenery. Upon close inspection, there are indeed pink flowers with yellow centers visible within the crown, consistent with the appearance of peonies. These flowers are integrated into a larger arrangement that includes vines and leaves, suggesting a natural, ethereal theme. The presence of these specific flowers aligns with the description in the question. This conclusion is drawn from visual identification of flower shape, color, and center structure, combined with common knowledge about peony characteristics.",

      "question": "Is the dark green high collar still visible on the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is wearing a flowing emerald-green gown with a deep V-neckline and no visible high collar. Instead, the neckline is low and open, revealing the upper chest and shoulders. There is no indication of a high collar or any dark green fabric around the neck area. This contrasts with typical high-collared garments, which would extend up the neck. Based on visual analysis and understanding of clothing styles, the absence of a high collar is clear. Therefore, the dark green high collar is not present.",

      "question": "Is the lighting still soft and even, coming from the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to be natural and diffused, likely from an overcast sky or filtered sunlight through the trees in the background. The illumination is soft and evenly distributed across the subject’s face and body, with subtle shadows that suggest a frontal light source. However, the directionality is not strictly frontal—it seems to come from slightly above and in front, as indicated by the gentle highlights on the forehead and cheeks and the soft shadows under the chin and along the sides of the face. Given that the scene is outdoors in a forested area, the ambient lighting is naturally softened by foliage. While it is soft and even, the light source is not purely frontal but rather overhead and slightly forward. Thus, the lighting is soft and even, but not strictly from the front.",

      "question": "Are the subject's eyes still dark brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s eyes appear to be a light grayish-blue hue, not dark brown. This can be observed by examining the iris coloration, which lacks the rich, warm tones associated with dark brown eyes. Instead, the irises have a cool, pale tone that reflects ambient light differently, suggesting a lighter eye color. Additionally, the overall skin tone and facial features support this observation, as lighter eye colors are often paired with certain complexions. Based on visual cues and common knowledge about human eye color variation, the eyes are not dark brown.",

      "question": "Is the subject's face still centered in the frame with a frontal pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is positioned centrally in the frame, but her pose is not fully frontal. She is facing slightly to her right (viewer’s left), with her head turned toward the camera, creating a three-quarter view rather than a direct frontal orientation. Her gaze is directed slightly off-center, and the composition emphasizes her full figure and surroundings rather than a tight, centered facial shot. While her face is near the center of the image, the pose is not strictly frontal. Therefore, although the face is approximately centered, the pose is not fully frontal.",
