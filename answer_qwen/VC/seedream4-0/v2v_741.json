      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is wearing a uniform that clearly features both purple and white colors. The jacket has purple sleeves and accents, with white panels on the torso and collar. The hat is also purple with a white trim. This color combination is consistent across both panels of the image. Based on visual inspection, the attire includes both colors prominently. This conclusion is drawn from direct observation of the character’s clothing in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible text on the character’s uniform or anywhere in the scene that reads 'XML Application Platform xfy'. While the first image (Image A) shows this text on a notebook cover, the character in Image B does not display any such text. The character’s uniform has a small emblem with an 'A' and a triangle, but it does not contain the full phrase. Therefore, based on visual evidence alone, the specific text is absent from the character’s design.",

      "question": "Does the character have a design element resembling a spiral binding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B does not have any physical feature resembling a spiral binding. Spiral bindings are typically found on notebooks or binders and consist of coiled metal rings along one edge. While Image A shows a notebook with a spiral binding, the character in Image B is human-like and wears a uniform without any such mechanical structure. There is no visual indication of a spiral binding on her body or attire. Thus, this element is not present in the character’s design.",

      "question": "Is there a black wireless mouse in the character's hand or nearby in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is seated at a desk with a computer setup. In both panels, she is using a black computer mouse. The mouse appears to be wired, as a cable extends from it toward the computer. However, the question asks specifically about a 'wireless' mouse. Since the presence of a visible cable indicates it is wired, it cannot be classified as wireless. Therefore, although a black mouse is present, it is not wireless. This conclusion is based on observing the physical connection between the mouse and the system.",

      "question": "Is the character depicted holding or interacting with the black wireless mouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character is indeed interacting with a black mouse in both panels of Image B. In the top panel, she is actively using it with her right hand while typing. In the bottom panel, she continues to hold it. However, as previously noted, the mouse has a visible wire, indicating it is not wireless. The question specifies 'wireless mouse', so even though she is interacting with a black mouse, it does not meet the 'wireless' criterion. Therefore, the answer must reflect that she is not interacting with a wireless mouse, despite the interaction with a black mouse.",
