      "question": "Is the sink positioned directly below the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sink is centered horizontally beneath the mirror, and there is a clear vertical alignment between the two. The mirror is mounted on the wall above the sink, and the sink's position appears to be directly under the center of the mirror. This alignment is typical in modern bathroom designs for both aesthetic symmetry and functional convenience. Based on visual cues such as the positioning of the faucet and soap dispenser relative to the mirror's reflection, it is evident that the sink is indeed placed directly below the mirror. There are no visible offsets or misalignments that would suggest otherwise.",

      "question": "Does the image include a mirror with a black frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mirror in Image B has a distinct black border surrounding its reflective surface. This frame is consistent in color and thickness around all four edges of the mirror, matching the overall dark, minimalist aesthetic of the bathroom. The black frame contrasts sharply with the brightly colored ambient lighting (pink and blue hues) and the white sink, making it visually prominent. This design choice aligns with modern interior trends where black frames are used to create a sleek, contemporary look. Therefore, based on the visual evidence, the mirror does have a black frame.",

      "question": "Are the fixtures and cabinet predominantly black, while the sink remains white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faucet, soap dispenser, and the cabinet beneath the sink are all black, contributing to a cohesive dark theme. The faucet and soap dispenser are mounted on the wall and have a matte black finish, which matches the cabinet’s exterior. The cabinet itself is black with smooth, rounded edges and minimal hardware, reinforcing the modern design. In contrast, the sink basin is clearly white, providing a strong visual contrast against the black elements. This color scheme is common in contemporary bathrooms to create a striking yet balanced appearance. Thus, the description accurately reflects the color distribution in the image.",

      "question": "Do the mirror, sink, and cabinets maintain their rectangular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mirror in Image B is rectangular, with straight edges and right angles, consistent with standard mirror designs. The sink is also rectangular, with a flat, square-shaped basin integrated into a white countertop. The cabinet below the sink is rectangular as well, with clean lines and a boxy form, although it features slightly rounded corners, which is a common design element in modern furniture. Despite the slight curvature at the edges, the overall shape remains fundamentally rectangular. Therefore, all three objects—mirror, sink, and cabinet—maintain rectangular forms, even if they incorporate subtle design modifications.",

      "question": "Is the black faucet positioned beside the black soap dispenser on the sink?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black faucet is mounted on the wall to the left of the sink, while the black soap dispenser is placed on the right side of the sink. Both are aligned horizontally and appear to be symmetrically positioned relative to the sink's centerline. The faucet is closer to the edge of the sink, and the soap dispenser sits just to the right of it, creating a balanced arrangement. Given this spatial relationship, the faucet is indeed positioned beside the soap dispenser, albeit not directly adjacent but within close proximity on the same horizontal plane. This layout is typical in modern bathroom setups to ensure ease of use and aesthetic harmony.",
