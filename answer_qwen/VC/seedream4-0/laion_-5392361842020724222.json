      "question": "Is there a golden circular halo positioned directly above Mary's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Mary is depicted with a golden circular halo clearly positioned above her head. This is consistent with traditional Christian iconography, where halos symbolize holiness or divine light. The halo is a thin, gold ring that encircles her head, matching the visual representation of sacred figures in religious art. This element is standard in depictions of the Virgin Mary and aligns with both artistic conventions and theological symbolism.",

      "question": "Does Joseph hold a staff with a white lily flower at its tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Joseph is shown holding a staff that ends in a white lily flower. The lily is a traditional symbol of purity and innocence in Christian art, often associated with Mary, but also sometimes linked to Joseph as a sign of his virtuous character. The staff itself is long and slender, with the lily clearly visible at the top. This detail is consistent with symbolic representations in religious paintings and sculptures, reinforcing Joseph’s role as a protector and guardian.",

      "question": "Is there a golden radiating halo (fan-shaped rays) behind the infant Jesus' head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infant Jesus has a golden, fan-shaped halo composed of radiating rays behind his head. This type of halo, known as a 'glory' or 'radiant halo,' is commonly used in Christian art to signify divinity and the presence of God. The rays are bright and golden, emanating outward from the child’s head, which emphasizes his status as the Son of God. This feature is typical in Nativity scenes and reinforces the theological significance of the Christ Child.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Mary is indeed shown in a kneeling posture. Her knees are bent, and she is seated on a rock-like base, indicating reverence and humility. Her hands are clasped together in front of her, a gesture commonly associated with prayer or contemplation. This pose reflects traditional depictions of Mary in Nativity scenes, where she is portrayed as reverent and devout in the presence of her newborn son.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infant Jesus is lying on his back on a white, fluffy surface. His arms are folded across his chest, a common pose in religious art for infants to convey peace, innocence, and divine calm. This positioning is consistent with traditional Nativity imagery, where the Christ Child is often depicted in a serene, almost regal manner, emphasizing his peaceful arrival into the world.",

      "question": "Are the figures arranged such that Mary is on the left, Joseph on the right, and the infant Jesus is centrally located between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition places Mary on the left side of the scene, kneeling and facing the infant Jesus. Joseph is positioned on the right, standing and leaning slightly forward toward the child. The infant Jesus is placed centrally between them, lying on a white cushion. This arrangement follows classical artistic conventions in Nativity scenes, where the Holy Family is symmetrically balanced, with the Christ Child as the focal point. The spatial layout emphasizes unity and harmony within the family.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both Mary and Joseph are depicted standing on distinct, rock-like bases beneath their feet. These bases are sculpted to resemble natural stone and serve as platforms for each figure. Mary’s base is to her left, and Joseph’s is to his right, separating them visually while still maintaining their connection through the central placement of the infant Jesus. This use of individual bases is consistent with sculptural traditions in religious statuary, where each figure is grounded independently yet part of a unified scene.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infant Jesus is lying on a white, fluffy surface that resembles fur or wool. This soft, textured material is placed beneath him to represent the manger or swaddling clothes, symbolizing the humble circumstances of his birth. The white color conveys purity and innocence, aligning with Christian themes of divinity and new life. This element is common in Nativity scenes to emphasize the tender and sacred nature of the moment.",
