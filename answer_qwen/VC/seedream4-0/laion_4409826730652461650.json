      "question": "Is the tan and white fur pattern, including the white blaze on the face and chest patch, present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is depicted in a cartoon-style illustration set in a Western-themed environment. Despite the stylized art style, the coloration of the horse remains consistent with the original toy’s design. The tan body with a prominent white blaze running down the center of the face and a large white patch on the chest are clearly visible. These features are preserved in the digital rendering, indicating that the fur pattern has been maintained even though the image is now part of a comic-style scene. This consistency suggests that the artist intentionally retained the recognizable features of the original toy for brand recognition and visual continuity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's mane and tail are rendered in a dark brown color, matching the original toy’s appearance. Although the artistic style is exaggerated and cartoonish, the dark brown hair on the top of the head (mane) and the tail at the rear are clearly visible and consistent with the original design. The texture may be simplified due to the illustrative nature of the image, but the color and placement align with the original toy’s characteristics. This preservation ensures that the character retains its identity within the illustrated narrative.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is shown wearing a bridle that matches the original toy’s design. The bridle appears as a brown strap across the nose and over the head, consistent with the fabric material seen in the real product. Additionally, a wooden handle extends from the back of the head, which is a key feature of the rocking horse design. Even though the illustration is stylized, these elements are clearly represented and positioned correctly, indicating that the functional and aesthetic components of the bridle and handle have been faithfully included in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is depicted with four dark brown wheels attached to its legs, which are clearly visible in both panels of the comic. These wheels are consistent in color and placement with the original toy, serving as a functional feature that allows the horse to rock or roll. The wheels are rendered in a simplified but accurate manner, maintaining their position under each leg and preserving their dark brown hue. This detail supports the toy’s dual functionality as both a rocker and a ride-on, and it is accurately reflected in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocking base beneath the horse is clearly visible in both panels. It is light brown in color and shaped like a traditional rocking mechanism. The 'Rockin’ Rider' branding is also present on the side of the base, although slightly less detailed due to the cartoon style. However, the text is still readable and matches the original toy’s labeling. This indicates that the manufacturer’s branding has been preserved in the edited version, ensuring product recognition within the illustrated context.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white blaze on the horse’s face and the white patch on the chest are distinctly visible despite the stylized art style. The blaze runs vertically from the forehead to the muzzle, and the chest patch is large and well-defined. These features are essential for identifying the toy and are rendered with sufficient clarity in the cartoon depiction. The contrast between the tan fur and the white markings is strong, making them easily distinguishable. Thus, the key visual identifiers are preserved and clearly visible.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse’s facial features are exaggerated for comedic effect, but they still retain the original toy’s characteristics. The mouth is rendered in a bright pink color, consistent with the plush toy’s design. The eyes are yellow with black pupils, and they are clearly visible in both panels. While the expression is more animated—especially in the second panel where the horse is smiling—the core features remain unchanged. This indicates that the artist preserved the toy’s signature facial details to maintain visual authenticity.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small red and yellow logo on the left ear of the horse is present in both panels. Although the image is stylized and the details are slightly simplified, the logo can still be identified by its distinct colors and shape. In the original toy, this logo serves as a brand identifier, and its inclusion in the edited image confirms that the artist aimed to preserve all recognizable features of the product. Given the attention to detail in other aspects of the horse’s design, the presence of the logo is consistent with the overall effort to maintain accuracy.",
