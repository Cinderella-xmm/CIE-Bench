      "question": "Is the astronaut's face visible through a clear, circular helmet visor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is depicted in a stylized, illustrated format. The helmet has a transparent visor that allows the face to be clearly seen. The visor is circular and appears smooth, consistent with typical space suit designs. The illustration style uses clean lines and shading to represent transparency, and the facial features are distinct and unobstructed. Based on visual cues and common knowledge of astronaut helmets, which are designed to provide full visibility, the face is indeed visible through the visor. There is no indication of fogging, obstruction, or tinting.",

      "question": "Is there a red, white, and blue American flag patch located on the left shoulder of the suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut’s spacesuit features a patch on the left shoulder (from the viewer’s perspective). The patch displays horizontal stripes in red and white, along with a blue field containing white stars, which is consistent with the design of the American flag. This matches the standard placement and appearance of the U.S. flag patch on NASA spacesuits. Although the image is stylized, the colors and pattern are recognizable as the American flag. Therefore, based on both visual evidence and world knowledge about NASA mission patches, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Is there a large, boxy life-support pack attached to the astronaut’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a prominent, rectangular structure affixed to the astronaut’s back. This component is detailed with panels, connectors, and what appear to be control modules—consistent with the design of a Portable Life Support System (PLSS), commonly used in NASA spacesuits. The shape is boxy and elevated, matching real-world examples such as those used in Apollo missions. Even though the artwork is illustrative, it accurately represents the essential form and function of a life-support pack. Thus, based on visual cues and technical knowledge of spacesuit components, the presence of such a pack is confirmed.",

      "question": "Are there visible segmented joints at the elbows and knees of the spacesuit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spacesuit is shown with articulated sections at both the elbows and knees. These areas feature distinct bends and layered segments, which are characteristic of mobility joints in real spacesuits. The joints allow for movement while maintaining pressure integrity. The illustration includes shading and line work that emphasizes these articulations, suggesting flexibility. This aligns with known engineering principles of spacesuit design, where segmented joints are necessary for range of motion. Therefore, the visual evidence supports the presence of such joints.",

      "question": "Is there visible dust being kicked up from the lunar surface beneath the astronaut’s right boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is standing on a cratered lunar surface, but there is no visible plume or cloud of dust emanating from the right boot. The ground around the boot appears static and undisturbed. While the illustration includes texture to suggest moon regolith, there is no depiction of motion or disturbance such as dust being displaced. In contrast, real lunar landings often show dust kick-up due to low gravity and loose soil, but this effect is absent here. Therefore, based on visual inspection and absence of dynamic effects, the answer is no.",

      "question": "Is a bright, spherical Earth visible in the sky behind the astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a star-filled sky with a decorative border featuring stars and lightning bolts. However, there is no large, spherical object resembling Earth visible in the sky. Instead, the scene is stylized with minimal celestial elements beyond scattered stars. Realistic depictions of lunar surface scenes often include Earth as a prominent feature, but in this artistic rendering, Earth is not present. The lack of any large, illuminated sphere in the background confirms its absence. Therefore, based on visual analysis and comparison with known lunar imagery, the answer is no.",

      "question": "Is the helmet shaped as a smooth, circular dome with a reflective outer surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet has a rounded, dome-like shape that is consistent with traditional astronaut helmets. It appears smooth and uniformly curved, with a reflective quality suggested by highlights and subtle shading. The outer surface reflects light and surrounding elements, such as the stars and background, indicating reflectivity. While the style is illustrative rather than photorealistic, the design adheres to the known characteristics of actual space helmets, which are made of durable, reflective materials like polycarbonate or glass. The visual cues support the conclusion that the helmet is both smooth and reflective.",
