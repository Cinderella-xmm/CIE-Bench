    "Question": "Q1: Is the steaming cup of coffee present in the center of the image?",
    "explanation": "The steaming cup of coffee is positioned centrally within the frame, both horizontally and vertically. The composition draws the viewerâ€™s attention directly to the cup, which is placed on a saucer atop a wooden table. This central placement is reinforced by the symmetrical lighting and shadows cast across the table surface, suggesting intentional framing. The cup is clearly the focal point of the image, with no other object competing for visual dominance. Based on this spatial arrangement and visual emphasis, it can be concluded that the cup is indeed centered.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the table retain its wooden texture?",
    "explanation": "The table surface exhibits clear wood grain patterns, visible planks, and natural variations in color and tone consistent with real wood. The texture is accentuated by the interplay of light and shadow, especially where sunlight strikes the surface, highlighting the grooves and lines between the planks. These details are indicative of a wooden material rather than a synthetic or painted surface. There is no evidence of smoothing or textural alteration that would suggest loss of the original wooden appearance. Therefore, the wooden texture is preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are kitchen cabinets and kitchen utensils visible in the background?",
    "explanation": "In the background, white kitchen cabinets with glass-paneled doors are clearly visible above a countertop. On the counter, various kitchen items such as utensils in a holder, a bowl, and other small containers can be discerned despite the shallow depth of field. Although slightly blurred due to focus on the foreground cup, these elements are identifiable as typical kitchenware. The presence of these objects confirms that the setting is a kitchen, and they contribute to the overall domestic atmosphere. Thus, both cabinets and utensils are visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Has the natural lighting streaming from the left side been preserved?",
    "explanation": "Light enters from the left side of the frame, casting distinct diagonal shadows across the wooden table and illuminating the left side of the coffee cup more brightly than the right. This directional lighting creates a warm, soft glow consistent with natural sunlight coming through a window. The shadows align with the expected path of light from the left, and the brightness gradient supports this directionality. No artificial lighting effects or changes in light source direction are evident. Therefore, the natural lighting from the left has been preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the steam visibly rising from the coffee cup?",
    "explanation": "Above the coffee cup, there is a visible plume of steam that rises upward in a swirling pattern, indicating heat emanating from the liquid inside. The steam is translucent and wispy, consistent with hot beverages like coffee or tea. Its form and movement suggest dynamic motion, reinforcing the idea that the drink is freshly poured and hot. This visual cue is supported by common knowledge about how steam behaves when it rises from a hot liquid. Hence, the steam is clearly visible and realistic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
