      "question": "Is the lace pattern visible on the bodice and long sleeves of the gown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration depicts a bride wearing a gown with intricate detailing. The bodice and long sleeves appear to have a delicate lace pattern, consistent with traditional bridal fashion. The texture is rendered in a way that suggests fine embroidery or lacework, especially noticeable in the shaded areas where light interacts with the fabric. This is supported by common bridal design practices where lace is often used on bodices and sleeves for elegance. Comparing this to typical wedding dress aesthetics, such patterns are frequently present in formal gowns. While the image is artistic and stylized, the visual cues—such as the textured lines and subtle shading—indicate the presence of lace. Therefore, based on both visual interpretation and world knowledge of bridal attire, the lace pattern is indeed visible.",

      "question": "Is a floral crown made of light pink and cream flowers positioned on top of the woman’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's head is adorned with a floral arrangement that sits atop her hair. The flowers depicted are soft in color, appearing to be shades of light pink and cream, which aligns with common bridal floral crowns. These colors are traditionally associated with romantic and vintage wedding styles. The placement of the flowers on the upper part of the head, just above the forehead, is consistent with how floral crowns are typically worn. Given that floral crowns are a popular accessory in bridal fashion, especially in bohemian or garden-themed weddings, the visual evidence supports the presence of such an accessory. Thus, based on both the visual details and cultural context, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Is a translucent veil attached to the back of the woman’s head and extending downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a sheer, flowing element extending from the back of the woman’s head down toward the floor. This element is rendered with a translucent quality, allowing the background to subtly show through, which is characteristic of a veil. The veil appears to originate from the back of the head, draping elegantly behind her. In bridal fashion, veils are commonly attached at the back of the head and flow down into a train. The illustration captures this detail accurately, using soft lines and transparency effects to convey the veil’s material. Therefore, based on both visual representation and standard bridal attire conventions, a translucent veil is present.",

      "question": "Is there a sheer lace panel extending from the left shoulder down into a train?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration shows a distinct sheer panel starting from the left shoulder and trailing down into a train-like extension. This panel is decorated with lace patterns and appears separate from the main skirt, suggesting it is an overlay or detachable train. The positioning and design are consistent with bridal fashion elements such as lace capes or side trains. The panel flows gracefully along the left side, indicating intentional design. Given that such features are common in high-fashion wedding dresses, particularly those with romantic or vintage influences, the visual evidence strongly supports the presence of this feature. Thus, the answer is confirmed by both observation and fashion knowledge.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress appears to have a structured bodice that fits closely to the body, transitioning into a gradually flaring skirt that widens toward the hem. This shape is characteristic of an A-line silhouette, which is one of the most common and classic wedding dress styles. The illustration shows the waistline clearly defined, with the skirt expanding outward in a smooth, symmetrical manner. While the artistic rendering may soften some edges, the overall form still aligns with the A-line profile. Based on both visual analysis and general knowledge of dress silhouettes, the description matches an A-line design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gown is depicted in soft, light tones dominated by white and off-white hues. Although the artistic style uses watercolor techniques that introduce subtle pastel shades like blush pink and cream, especially in the background and shadows, the primary color of the gown remains white. Bridal gowns are traditionally white, symbolizing purity and elegance, and this convention is upheld in the illustration. Even with the added artistic flair, the base color of the dress is unmistakably white. Therefore, despite the gentle color variations due to artistic rendering, the gown is primarily white.",
