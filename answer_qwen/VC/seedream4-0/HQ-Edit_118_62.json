      "question": "Is the classical archway with ornate carvings present and maintaining its original shape and position in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the archway is still visible and occupies a similar central position in the frame as in Image A. However, upon closer inspection, the material and texture of the archway have changed — it now appears to be made of wood rather than stone, which alters its visual character. Despite this change in material, the overall shape and structure of the archway, including its curved top and decorative border, remain consistent with the original. The ornate carvings are still present but appear simplified or stylized, possibly due to the wooden texture. Thus, while the form is preserved, the material and detail fidelity differ from the original. Based on the question’s focus on 'shape and position,' not material or fine detail, the archway maintains its original spatial configuration.",

      "question": "Is the Corinthian column capital with acanthus leaf detailing visible and correctly positioned beneath the spherical perch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spherical perch rests on a structure that resembles a column capital, but its appearance has been altered. The capital now appears to be made of a biscuit-like material, matching the rest of the scene's transformation into edible elements. The acanthus leaf detailing is still present but rendered in a simplified, cookie-like fashion, lacking the depth and intricacy seen in Image A. While the general shape and position of the capital are maintained, the level of detail and authenticity of the acanthus leaves are reduced. However, since the capital is still located directly below the spherical perch and retains the recognizable silhouette of a Corinthian capital, it can be considered correctly positioned, even if stylistically transformed.",

      "question": "Is the perch located directly on top of the Corinthian column capital, maintaining its original vertical alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spherical perch (now resembling a decorated biscuit) is placed directly above the column capital, just as in Image A. The vertical alignment between the perch and the capital remains unchanged, with no noticeable shift in positioning. Even though both the perch and the capital are now made of edible materials, their relative positions are preserved. The centering and stacking maintain the same structural relationship, indicating that the vertical alignment has been retained despite the thematic transformation of the scene.",

      "question": "Are the tall fluted column on the left and the distant spired buildings visible in their original positions and silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall fluted column on the left is still present and maintains its vertical orientation and general position within the frame. Its silhouette is similar, though it appears to be made of a light brown material, consistent with the edible theme. The distant spired buildings in the background also retain their original shapes and positions, although they too appear to be constructed from biscuit or cookie material. The overall skyline, including the pointed towers and modern skyscrapers, matches the original layout. Despite the change in material, the spatial arrangement and silhouettes of these architectural elements are preserved.",

      "question": "Is the sky depicted as bright blue with scattered white cumulus clouds, matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is indeed bright blue and filled with scattered white cumulus clouds, visually consistent with the sky in Image A. The cloud formations are soft and fluffy, evenly distributed across the upper portion of the image, contributing to a serene atmosphere. There is no significant difference in color tone or cloud pattern between the two images. This suggests that the sky has been preserved in both composition and aesthetic, even as other elements of the scene have undergone thematic transformation. Therefore, the sky matches the original in both appearance and mood.",

      "question": "Are the floral and scroll carvings on the arch and column frame present and accurately rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral and scroll carvings are still visible on the arch and column frame, but they are now rendered in a stylized, simplified manner consistent with the edible theme. The carvings appear embossed or imprinted onto the wooden or biscuit-like surface, lacking the three-dimensional depth and intricate detail seen in Image A. While the basic motifs — such as scrolls and floral patterns — are recognizable, their accuracy and precision have been compromised due to the transformation of materials. Therefore, although the carvings are present, they are not accurately rendered in terms of detail and realism compared to the original.",

      "question": "Is the pigeon oriented sideways with its head turned slightly toward the viewer, maintaining its original posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pigeon is positioned similarly to Image A: facing sideways with its head turned slightly toward the viewer. The bird’s body is angled to show its profile, and its head is turned in a way that gives a partial frontal view, consistent with the original posture. Although the pigeon in Image B is stylized as a plush or cookie-like figure, its orientation and pose match the original. The slight turn of the head and the side-on stance are preserved, indicating that the posture has been maintained despite the change in texture and material.",
