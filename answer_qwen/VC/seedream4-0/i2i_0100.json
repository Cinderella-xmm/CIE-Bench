      "question": "Are the cabinet doors and drawers designed in a shaker style in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-down schematic view shows clean, flat-panel cabinet doors and drawers with minimal detailing and recessed panels, which are characteristic of the shaker style. The side view also displays the same design elements—flat surfaces with simple, straight edges and visible frame-and-panel construction—consistent with shaker-style cabinetry. This is further supported by common knowledge that shaker cabinets feature a minimalist, functional design with a central panel framed by a surrounding frame, which matches both the top-down and side perspectives shown. Therefore, both views depict shaker-style cabinetry.",

      "question": "Do both the top-down and side views show two rectangular sink basins with consistent dimensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top-down view clearly depicts a single rectangular sink basin, not two. In contrast, the side view shows one rectangular sink basin integrated into the countertop. There is no visual evidence of two sinks in either view. Given that the original image (Image A) features a double vanity with two sinks, this discrepancy suggests that the edited image (Image B) has been altered to show only one sink. Thus, the representation does not match the original layout in terms of sink count or symmetry. Based on visual analysis and typical bathroom vanity configurations, it's clear that only one sink is present in both views of Image B, meaning the number of sinks is inconsistent with the original setup.",

      "question": "Are the black faucets present above each sink basin in both views with the correct orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the side view of Image B, a black faucet is clearly visible above the single sink, positioned centrally and oriented correctly for use. However, the top-down view shows only one faucet, even though it represents a single sink. Since the original image (Image A) had two sinks and two faucets, the edited version appears to have reduced the configuration to a single sink and faucet. The faucet in both views is black and properly oriented, but since there is only one sink, the presence of 'each' faucet above a sink cannot be confirmed. The term 'each' implies multiple sinks, which are absent here. Therefore, while the faucet is correctly oriented, the condition 'above each sink' fails due to the absence of a second sink.",

      "question": "Is the countertop depicted in both views as a light-colored marble texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the side view of Image B, the countertop is visibly light-colored with subtle gray veining, consistent with a marble texture. This matches typical representations of white or light-gray marble used in bathroom vanities. The top-down schematic view, although simplified, uses a patterned fill that mimics the appearance of marble, including veins and variations in tone. While it's not photorealistic, the design choice aligns with the intention to represent a marble surface. Combining visual cues with world knowledge about material representation in architectural diagrams, it's reasonable to conclude that both views aim to depict a light-colored marble texture, even if the top-down view is stylized.",

      "question": "Are the compartments (drawers and cabinets) arranged in the same manner in both the top-down and side views, mirroring the original layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top-down view in Image B shows a symmetrical layout with two cabinet sections flanking a central set of four drawers. The side view mirrors this arrangement, showing the same number of drawers and cabinet doors, placed symmetrically. This matches the original layout seen in Image A, where the vanity has two sets of doors and four drawers in the center. Both views maintain consistent compartment placement and proportions, indicating that the design has been preserved across both representations. Even though the side view is angled, the spatial relationship between the components remains accurate. Therefore, the compartments are arranged identically in both views, reflecting the original layout.",
