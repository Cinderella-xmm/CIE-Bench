      "question": "Is Joseph depicted holding a lantern in his right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Joseph is shown standing to the left of the manger. He is holding an object that resembles a lantern, which is consistent with traditional depictions of Joseph in nativity scenes. The lantern is clearly held in his right hand, as evidenced by the positioning of his arm and the orientation of the object. This aligns with common artistic representations where Joseph is often shown carrying a lantern to symbolize guidance or light. The visual details confirm that the object is a lantern and it is indeed in his right hand.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Mary is positioned on the right side of the manger. She is depicted in a posture of reverence, with her hands brought together in front of her chest. However, she is not kneeling; instead, she is standing. Her posture suggests prayer or adoration, but her legs are fully extended, indicating a standing position. Therefore, while her hands are clasped, she is not kneeling.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infant Jesus is lying in a manger-like structure. Around his head, there is a radiant halo made up of sharp, outward-pointing lines, resembling rays of light. This type of halo is commonly used in religious art to signify divinity and holiness. The visual representation clearly shows this radiant design, confirming the presence of such a halo.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two animals are visible near the manger: one is a donkey on the right side of the scene, and the other is a sheep on the left. Both are positioned close to the manger, consistent with traditional nativity scenes where animals are included to represent the stable environment. The donkey is facing toward the manger, and the sheep is standing nearby, both clearly identifiable by their distinct shapes and features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the peak of the roof structure above the manger, there is a prominent star. It has five points and is mounted centrally at the top of the archway. This star is a symbolic element commonly associated with the Star of Bethlehem in nativity scenes. Its placement and shape match the description of a five-pointed star, making it a clear visual feature of the composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the left side of the stable, there is a decorative element shaped like a palm tree. It is stylized with curved fronds and stands upright next to the structure. This matches the typical inclusion of a palm tree in nativity scenes to evoke a Middle Eastern setting. The form is clearly recognizable as a palm tree, even though it is artistically simplified.",

      "question": "Are there circular halos present around the heads of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each of the three central figures—Joseph, Mary, and Jesus—has a halo above their head. These halos are circular in shape and outlined in gold, a common artistic convention in religious iconography to denote sanctity. Joseph's halo is visible behind his head, Mary's is similarly placed, and Jesus's halo is more elaborate due to the radiating lines, but still forms a circular base. Thus, all three have circular halos.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infant Jesus is clearly lying within a manger-shaped cradle, which is placed under the roof structure of the stable. The manger is supported by legs and positioned centrally in the scene. The roof overhead provides shelter, and the baby is resting within this enclosed space, consistent with traditional depictions of the nativity. The spatial arrangement confirms that Jesus is inside a manger beneath the roof.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Joseph is indeed on the left side of the stable, holding a lantern. Mary is on the right side, standing in a reverent pose. The infant Jesus lies in the manger directly between them, centered in the scene. This arrangement is typical of many nativity depictions, where the Holy Family is symmetrically positioned with Jesus as the focal point. The spatial layout confirms the described positions.",
