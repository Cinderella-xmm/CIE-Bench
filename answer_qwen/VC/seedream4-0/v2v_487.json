      "question": "Is the kayak still bright yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kayak is clearly visible within the frame of a polaroid-style photograph. The kayak retains its bright yellow color, which is consistent with typical kayak designs for visibility and aesthetic appeal. The lighting in the image is even, allowing the yellow hue to be accurately represented without any noticeable discoloration or tinting. This conclusion is based on direct visual observation combined with common knowledge that kayaks are often brightly colored for safety and style. There is no indication of fading or alteration in color compared to standard expectations.",

      "question": "Are the black bungee cords in an X-pattern present on both ends of the kayak deck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kayak's deck is visible, and black bungee cords are arranged in an X-pattern at both the front and rear ends. These cords are commonly used on kayaks for securing gear and are typically positioned symmetrically. The pattern is clearly visible in the image, matching the standard design seen on recreational kayaks. The presence of these cords in the same configuration as expected from real-world kayaks supports the accuracy of this detail. No changes to their arrangement or appearance are evident.",

      "question": "Is there a black padded seat visible inside the kayak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior of the kayak is visible, showing a black padded seat. This type of seating is standard in kayaks to provide comfort during paddling. The seat appears to have contours and padding consistent with ergonomic design. Based on the visual evidence and common kayak features, the presence of such a seat is expected and aligns with real-world kayak construction. There is no distortion or absence of this feature in the image.",

      "question": "Does the skateboard have a dark gray grip tape surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top surface of the skateboard is covered with grip tape, which is visibly dark gray. Grip tape is typically made of sandpaper-like material and is usually dark gray or black to provide traction. The texture and color are consistent with standard skateboards. This observation is supported by general knowledge about skateboard design, where grip tape is essential for foot control. The color and texture match expectations without any anomalies.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard’s trucks (the metal components connecting the wheels to the deck) appear silver, which is typical for aluminum or chrome-plated hardware used in skateboards. The wheels are a light brown or tan color, consistent with polyurethane wheels commonly found on skateboards. These materials and colors are standard in skateboard manufacturing for durability and performance. The visual details in the image confirm these characteristics without deviation.",

      "question": "Are the kayak and skateboard aligned vertically and placed parallel to each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kayak and skateboard are oriented vertically and placed side by side. However, they are not perfectly parallel; the kayak is slightly angled relative to the skateboard. While both objects are aligned along a vertical axis, the kayak appears to be rotated slightly clockwise, causing a minor misalignment. In contrast, the skateboard remains straight. This difference in orientation suggests they are not fully parallel, despite being generally aligned vertically.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the kayak and skateboard appears to be a flat, uniform surface with a neutral beige tone. There are no visible patterns, textures, or variations in color that would suggest otherwise. The lighting is even, and the surface lacks shadows or reflections that might indicate irregularities. This consistency aligns with typical studio or controlled environments used in product photography. Therefore, the background can be described as uniformly neutral beige.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the kayak and skateboard cast shadows to their left. The shadows are soft and diffuse, indicating a light source from the right side of the scene. This is consistent with typical lighting setups in photography, where a single primary light source creates directional shadows. The shadow shapes correspond to the objects' forms, confirming their presence and directionality. There is no indication of multiple light sources or conflicting shadow directions.",
