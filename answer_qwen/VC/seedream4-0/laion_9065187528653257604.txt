    "Question": "Q1: Is the 'Indian' script logo visible and legible on the fuel tank?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is displayed inside a futuristic box labeled 'FUTURE RIDER,' with a stylized, illuminated presentation. The fuel tank of the motorcycle within the box appears white and has a visible script logo near the top center. Based on visual cues, the logo matches the cursive 'Indian' branding typically seen on Indian Motorcycles. Although the lighting and reflections in the display may slightly obscure fine details, the script is clearly distinguishable and consistent with known Indian Motorcycle logos. This conclusion is supported by world knowledge that Indian Motorcycles prominently feature this script logo on their fuel tanks. Therefore, the logo is both visible and legible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the engine cylinders arranged in a V-shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the engine of the motorcycle is visible through the transparent front of the display box. The engine block shows two distinct cylinder heads positioned at an angle to each other, forming a V-configuration. This is characteristic of a V-twin engine, commonly used in cruiser motorcycles like those from Indian. The arrangement is typical for such models, where the cylinders are angled to create a compact, powerful engine layout. This observation aligns with real-world engineering designs of Indian’s V-twin engines (e.g., the Thunder Stroke series). Thus, based on visual evidence and mechanical knowledge, the cylinders are indeed arranged in a V-shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are there two chrome exhaust pipes running along the right side of the motorcycle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is shown inside a display case with a reflective surface and neon lighting. On the right side of the motorcycle (from the viewer's perspective), two parallel chrome exhaust pipes are clearly visible extending from the engine toward the rear. These pipes are polished and have a tubular design consistent with dual exhaust systems found on cruiser motorcycles. The presence of two exhaust pipes on one side is typical for Indian Motorcycles, especially models like the Scout or Chief, which often feature side-exit exhausts. The visual clarity and reflection confirm their existence and alignment. Therefore, the answer is yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a black leather seat located above the engine and behind the fuel tank?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is displayed in a glass case with internal lighting. The seat is visible as a single, contoured black element positioned centrally over the engine and directly behind the fuel tank. Its shape and texture suggest it is made of leather or a synthetic material designed to mimic leather, consistent with cruiser-style seating. The placement—above the engine and behind the fuel tank—is typical for Indian cruiser motorcycles, where the rider sits low and centered. This positioning allows for ergonomic control and aesthetic balance. Given the visual cues and common design practices, the seat meets all criteria described in the question.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the fuel tank white and smooth with rounded contours?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fuel tank of the motorcycle is clearly visible through the display case. It is white in color, with a glossy finish and smooth, flowing lines. The shape is rounded and elongated, tapering slightly toward the rear, which is characteristic of classic cruiser-style fuel tanks. There are no sharp edges or angular features, reinforcing the idea of a smooth, aerodynamic design. This matches the design language of Indian Motorcycles, particularly models like the Scout or Bobber, which emphasize retro-modern styling with rounded tanks. The lighting enhances the curvature, confirming the rounded contours. Therefore, the description is accurate.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the exhaust pipes connect directly to the engine block?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the exhaust system is visible on the right side of the motorcycle. The two chrome pipes originate from the lower portion of the engine block, specifically near the cylinder heads, and extend rearward. In motorcycle design, exhaust headers typically connect directly to the engine’s cylinder heads to channel exhaust gases efficiently. The visual connection between the pipes and the engine block is clear, even though the display case adds some reflections. Based on standard motorcycle engineering principles and the observed geometry, the exhaust pipes do connect directly to the engine block. This is consistent with how V-twin engines are configured, where headers exit near the base of the cylinders. Thus, the connection is direct and functional.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Does the motorcycle have a low-slung, cruiser-style silhouette with a forward-leaning stance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is presented in a dynamic pose within the display case. The overall profile shows a low ground clearance, with the engine and frame positioned close to the ground, which is typical of cruiser motorcycles. The handlebars are raised and forward-facing, contributing to a forward-leaning riding posture. The long wheelbase and stretched-out appearance further reinforce the cruiser style. Additionally, the rake of the front fork and the position of the foot pegs suggest a relaxed, laid-back stance. This silhouette is consistent with Indian Motorcycles’ design philosophy, especially in models like the Scout or Chief. The visual cues—low profile, wide stance, and forward tilt—all support the conclusion that the motorcycle has a low-slung, cruiser-style silhouette with a forward-leaning stance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
