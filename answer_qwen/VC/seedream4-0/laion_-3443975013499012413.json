      "question": "Is the fish depicted in a continuous, coiled circular posture with its head pointing toward the upper right and tail curving beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish sculpture is clearly shown in a dynamic, coiled circular form. The head of the fish is oriented toward the upper right of the frame, and the body curves in a spiral fashion, with the tail extending downward and wrapping around to nearly meet the head. This creates a near-complete circular shape, consistent with a coiled posture. The continuity of the form suggests that the tail connects or approaches the head, reinforcing the circular design. This is supported by the symmetrical and flowing structure of the glass sculpture, which emphasizes fluidity and closure in its form.",

      "question": "Are there three distinct barbels extending from the lower jaw of the fish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the lower jaw of the fish features three small, rounded protrusions that resemble barbels—sensory organs commonly found on catfish-like species. These are clearly visible as three separate, elongated structures extending forward from the mouth area. Their placement and shape align with biological accuracy for certain fish species, such as catfish, which typically have multiple barbels. The clarity and detail in the glass sculpture allow for this feature to be discerned despite the stylized nature of the artwork.",

      "question": "Is the dorsal fin located along the upper back of the fish and shaped with a serrated edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dorsal fin is positioned along the upper back of the fish, running from just behind the head toward the mid-body. Its edge appears jagged or toothed, resembling a serrated pattern. This is consistent with the way many fish fins are structured, especially in artistic interpretations where texture and detail are emphasized. The faceted, crystalline nature of the glass material enhances the appearance of sharp edges, contributing to the serrated look. Thus, both location and shape support the description.",

      "question": "Are the scales arranged in overlapping rows along the body of the fish, running from head to tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the fish in Image B is composed of numerous geometric facets that mimic the appearance of scales. These facets are arranged in a repeating, overlapping pattern that follows the curvature of the fish's body from the head toward the tail. The arrangement creates a sense of depth and movement, typical of scale patterns in fish anatomy. While the representation is stylized due to the material (glass), the visual logic of overlapping rows is evident, particularly along the lateral line and flanks of the fish.",

      "question": "Does the tail of the fish curve underneath the body and connect near the head, completing a nearly full circle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the fish extends downward and wraps around the underside of the body, forming a loop that brings it close to the head. The sculpture’s design creates a near-circular shape, with the tail almost touching or meeting the front portion of the fish. This closed-loop structure is a central feature of the artwork, emphasizing symmetry and continuity. Although it does not fully touch, the proximity and alignment suggest a nearly complete circle, fulfilling the description of 'nearly full'.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two pectoral fins visible on the side of the fish, one near the head and one further back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only one pair of pectoral fins is clearly visible on the side of the fish, located near the head. There is no second set of pectoral fins further back along the body. Pectoral fins are typically paired and positioned under the gills, but in this sculptural interpretation, only one set is present. The other side may be obscured due to the angle or artistic simplification. Therefore, based on visible evidence, only one pair is shown.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the fish sculpture as a freestanding, three-dimensional object made of glass, mounted on a mirrored pedestal. It is not embedded in or bounded by any panel, let alone a square-shaped one with rounded corners. In contrast, Image A (the original) depicts a wooden panel with such characteristics. However, since this question pertains only to Image B, the answer must reflect the actual content: there is no panel at all in Image B. The sculpture exists independently in space.",
