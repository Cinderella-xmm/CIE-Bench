      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboarder is depicted inside a snow globe in a stylized, cartoonish form. Despite the artistic simplification, the figure maintains a dynamic posture: both knees are bent, and the arms are positioned outward—one slightly raised and the other extended backward—mimicking a balancing motion typical of skateboarding tricks. This pose aligns with the biomechanics of performing an aerial trick, where body positioning is crucial for stability. Although the character is not realistic, the pose captures the essence of mid-trick movement. Comparing this to Image A, the original real-life skateboarder also has bent knees and extended arms for balance during a jump. The edited version preserves this core action, albeit in a more exaggerated and simplified manner. Therefore, based on visual cues and common knowledge about skateboarding dynamics, the pose is retained.",

      "question": "** Is the skateboard visible beneath the skateboarder, oriented as if in motion during a trick?\n\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is clearly visible beneath the cartoon-style skateboarder. It is tilted at an angle, with its nose pointing upward and the tail downward, suggesting it is in the middle of an ollie or similar trick. The wheels are off the ground, and the board appears to be rotating slightly, consistent with motion during a trick. This orientation reflects the physics of skateboarding tricks where the board is airborne and angled due to momentum and control. In Image A, the skateboard is also airborne and similarly angled, indicating motion. While the style in Image B is simplified and stylized, the functional orientation of the skateboard relative to the rider matches that of a real trick. Thus, the skateboard’s position accurately conveys motion.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon character is dressed in a black short-sleeved shirt and olive-green pants. These colors match those worn by the skateboarder in Image A, confirming consistency in attire. Even though the character is stylized and lacks fine details like fabric texture, the clothing colors and basic silhouette are preserved. This suggests that the edit intentionally maintained the original outfit to preserve identity and theme. From a world knowledge perspective, such color retention helps viewers recognize the subject despite stylistic changes. Hence, the clothing description remains accurate.",

      "question": "** Are there tiny ramps and palm trees visible inside the snow globe, reflecting the skate park theme?\n\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a snow globe containing miniature elements that represent a skate park environment. Inside, two small ramps are visible, shaped like half-pipes or quarter-pipes, which are common features in skate parks. Additionally, two tiny palm trees are present, echoing the tropical setting seen in Image A. These elements are placed on a snowy base, which contrasts humorously with the outdoor, sunny skate park backdrop outside the globe. The inclusion of these objects serves as a thematic homage to the original scene, blending the real-world skate park with a whimsical, enclosed winter scene. This creative choice reflects an intentional design to capture the essence of the original location while transforming it into a novelty item.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboarder is positioned above the skateboard, with one foot on the tail and the other near the middle, mimicking the stance used during a trick like an ollie. The board is tilted and airborne, and the character's body leans forward, indicating active engagement. Although the figure is cartoonish and lacks realistic muscle tension or detailed motion blur, the posture and spatial relationship between the rider and the board suggest dynamic interaction. In Image A, the real skateboarder is clearly in contact with the board during a trick, with precise foot placement and body alignment. The edited version abstracts but retains this interaction through proportional positioning and implied motion. Therefore, despite the stylization, the sense of active performance is preserved.",
