      "question": "Is the rosette badge with the text \"GRAND CHAMPION\" and black-and-white ribbon design still present on the chest of the third individual?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third individual (center) is wearing a colorful superhero-style costume with floral patterns. A rosette badge is visible on their chest, featuring a black-and-white ribbon design and the text 'GRAND CHAMPION'. This matches the description in the question. The badge is clearly placed in the same position as it was in the original image, albeit now integrated into the new costume design. The visual details confirm its presence and legibility.",

      "question": "Is the wristwatch visible on the left wrist of the third individual?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third individual is dressed in a full-body superhero costume with long sleeves and gloves that cover the hands and wrists. There is no visible wristwatch on the left wrist due to the costume's design, which obscures the wrist area. In contrast, in Image A, the third individual wears a short-sleeve shirt and a visible wristwatch on the left wrist. The transformation into a costume has removed or hidden this detail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third individual’s hands are covered by gloves as part of the superhero costume. The fingers are not exposed, so any ring that might have been present in the original image is not visible. In Image A, the third individual’s left hand is bare, and a ring is clearly visible on the ring finger. The costume change in Image B conceals all jewelry, including rings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third individual’s arms are fully covered by a tight-fitting, patterned superhero suit with no exposed skin. The forearm is completely concealed, making any tattoo invisible. In Image A, the third individual’s left forearm displays a visible tattoo beneath the sleeve of the plaid shirt. The costume in Image B covers the entire arm, thus hiding the tattoo.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a garden with numerous yellow daffodils blooming in the flowerbeds behind the individuals. These flowers are prominent and clearly visible, both in the mid-ground and foreground. The setting appears to be the same outdoor location as in Image A, where daffodils were also present. The continuity of the environment supports the visibility of these flowers in both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the five individuals are arranged in the same left-to-right order as in Image A. Each person corresponds to the same individual from the original photo, maintaining their relative positions. Although they are now dressed in costumes, their physical characteristics (such as height, build, and facial features) allow for identification and confirmation of their order. The composition and spacing are consistent with the original arrangement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone retaining wall is visible behind the group, running horizontally across the background. It is partially obscured by the individuals and some foliage, but its structure and stonework are clearly identifiable. This matches the setting in Image A, where the same wall was present. The continuity of the environment suggests that the wall remains a key feature of the backdrop.",
