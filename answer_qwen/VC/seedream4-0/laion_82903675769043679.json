      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the curved contour of the fairway, leading from the foreground toward the green, preserved in its original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fairway appears to have undergone a significant stylization process. The natural curvature and smooth gradation of the grassy terrain are replaced with a geometric, checkered pattern composed of irregularly shaped polygons. This transformation distorts the original organic flow of the fairway, which in real-world golf courses typically features subtle undulations and continuous contours. The visual cues suggest a deliberate artistic alteration rather than a preservation of the original shape. Therefore, the curved contour is not preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sand bunkers located in their original positions along the fairway, particularly near the green and on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sand bunkers are still present near the green and on the left side of the fairway, maintaining their general placement relative to the green. However, their shapes have been stylized into angular, polygonal forms that deviate from the natural, rounded appearance typical of real sand traps. While their spatial positioning remains consistent with the original layout, their form has been abstracted. Thus, they are in their original positions but not in their original form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the water hazard present in the foreground, directly bordering the fairway, and reflecting the sky and structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a body of water is indeed present in the foreground, bordering the fairway. However, instead of reflecting the sky and surrounding structures realistically, it displays a fragmented, mosaic-like reflection composed of colorful geometric shapes. This suggests an artistic interpretation rather than a realistic depiction. While the water hazard exists in the same location, its reflective properties have been altered dramatically. Therefore, although the water hazard is present, it does not reflect the sky and structures in a natural way.",

      "question": "Are the AT&T GOLF tower and the white event tents located in the right midground, adjacent to the spectator area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the AT&T GOLF tower and the white event tents are visible in the right midground, positioned near the spectator area. Their relative locations appear consistent with the original image, despite the stylization. The tower retains its vertical structure and branding, and the tents maintain their rectangular form and placement. Although colors and textures are exaggerated, the spatial arrangement aligns with the original scene. Thus, their positions are preserved.",

      "question": "Is the green area elevated at the back, forming a slight incline from the fairway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green area at the back appears to be elevated compared to the fairway, though this elevation is represented through stylized, blocky segments rather than a smooth gradient. The visual cues suggest a rise in terrain, consistent with the original design of many golf courses where greens are often raised for strategic play. Despite the abstract rendering, the overall topography implies an incline. Therefore, the elevation is preserved in concept, even if not in realistic detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a dense group of spectators visible along the edge of the fairway, especially near the green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a group of figures resembling spectators is visible along the edge of the fairway, particularly near the green. These figures are stylized as simplified, colorful silhouettes, but their density and positioning match the original scene's composition. They are clustered along the boundary of the playing area, indicating a spectator presence. Although individual details are lost due to abstraction, the collective representation confirms their presence and density.",
