      "question": "Does the character wear a red ski outfit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in both panels wearing a bright red ski suit that includes a jacket and pants. This outfit is consistent with typical winter sports attire designed for visibility and warmth. The red color stands out against the white snow, which is common in ski clothing to enhance safety and visibility on slopes. Based on visual evidence from both panels, the character's attire matches the description of a red ski outfit. There are no indications of any other colors dominating the outfit, confirming its red nature.",

      "question": "Is the character wearing a black helmet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both panels of Image B, the character is clearly shown wearing a black helmet. Helmets are standard safety gear in skiing to protect against head injuries during falls or collisions. The helmet appears to be full-coverage, fitting snugly over the head, which aligns with modern ski safety equipment design. The black color contrasts with the red outfit and white snow, making it visually distinct. No other color or style of helmet is visible, so we can confidently confirm the presence of a black helmet.",

      "question": "Are skis and poles present in both panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the top panel of Image B, the character is standing upright on skis, holding ski poles in both hands, indicating active skiing. In the bottom panel, although the character has fallen, the skis are still attached to their boots and the poles are visibleâ€”one held in hand and the other lying nearby. Ski poles are essential tools for balance and propulsion in skiing, and their presence in both scenes reflects realistic skiing dynamics. Even when falling, skiers typically retain at least one pole, and the image shows this accurately. Therefore, skis and poles are present in both panels.",

      "question": "Is there a snowy mountain backdrop with scattered rocks in both panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both panels of Image B depict a snowy mountain environment. In the top panel, the background shows a wide expanse of snow-covered terrain with visible rock outcrops scattered across the slope. The bottom panel continues this setting, maintaining the same snowy landscape with rocks partially buried in snow. The continuity of the environment suggests a consistent location. The presence of rocks indicates a natural alpine setting rather than a groomed resort slope, which adds realism. Thus, the snowy mountain backdrop with scattered rocks is present in both panels.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both panels of Image B, the character is seen wearing a black backpack. Backpacks are commonly used by skiers to carry essentials like water, snacks, extra layers, or safety gear. The backpack is securely fastened with straps visible over the shoulders and back. Its color is consistently black in both scenes, matching the helmet and gloves, suggesting a coordinated gear setup. There is no indication of a different colored or missing backpack, so we can confirm the presence of a black backpack.",
