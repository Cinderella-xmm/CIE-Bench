      "question": "Does the subject wear a white lab coat in all six chibi-style stickers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are six chibi-style stickers of a character resembling a scientist. Each sticker shows the character in various poses and activities. Observing each sticker individually: the top-left sticker shows the character holding a beaker and a molecular model, wearing a white lab coat; the top-right shows the character holding a clipboard, also in a white lab coat; the middle-left shows the character gesturing, still in a white lab coat; the middle-right shows a chalkboard with equations, but no character is present—this is not a character sticker; the bottom-left shows the character sitting cross-legged with goggles, wearing a lab coat; the bottom-right shows the character using a microscope, again in a lab coat. The only exception is the middle-right sticker, which is a chalkboard and does not feature the character at all. Since the question asks about the 'subject' (the character) and whether they wear a lab coat in all six stickers, and one of the six stickers does not include the subject at all, we must evaluate based on the five that do. All five character stickers show the subject in a white lab coat. Therefore, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Is the subject wearing a light blue shirt visible beneath the lab coat in all stickers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing each sticker where the subject appears: in the top-left, the character has a visible light blue shirt under the lab coat; in the top-right, the same is true; in the middle-left, the character's collar and shirt are clearly light blue; in the bottom-left, the shirt is visible and matches the same color; in the bottom-right, the character’s shirt is also light blue. However, the middle-right sticker is not a character sticker—it’s a chalkboard—so it doesn’t count. Among the five character stickers, all show the light blue shirt underneath the lab coat. There is no variation in shirt color across these stickers. Thus, the answer is yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at each character sticker: the top-left, top-right, middle-left, bottom-left, and bottom-right all depict the character with short brown hair. The hair style and color are consistent across all five character stickers. The middle-right sticker is a chalkboard, so it does not feature the character. Since all character stickers show the same hairstyle and hair color, the subject retains short brown hair in all relevant stickers. Therefore, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Does the subject retain a beard in all chibi-style stickers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a chibi cartoon style. Chibi characters often simplify facial features, and beards are typically omitted unless specifically included. Observing the stickers: the top-left, top-right, middle-left, bottom-left, and bottom-right all show the character with no facial hair. The character has a clean-shaven face in all cases. This contrasts with the original image (Image A), where the man has a full beard. However, the question is about Image B only. Since none of the stickers show a beard, the answer is no.",

      "question": "Do at least four of the six stickers include a scientific prop (e.g., beaker, clipboard, microscope)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "We analyze each of the six stickers in Image B: 1) Top-left: includes a beaker and molecular model—scientific props. 2) Top-right: includes a clipboard—considered a scientific prop in context. 3) Middle-left: no prop, just gesturing. 4) Middle-right: chalkboard with equations—this is a scientific prop. 5) Bottom-left: safety goggles—often used in labs, counts as a scientific prop. 6) Bottom-right: microscope—clearly a scientific prop. So, the stickers with scientific props are: top-left, top-right, middle-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right—five in total. Even if we exclude the chalkboard (as ambiguous), we still have four (beaker, clipboard, goggles, microscope). Therefore, at least four stickers include scientific props. The answer is yes.",
