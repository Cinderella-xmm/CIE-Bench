      "question": "Is the AXE logo still visible on the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the AXE logo is clearly visible on the front of the container. The logo is rendered in bold white letters with a red accent, consistent with the brand's typical design. Despite the dramatic visual effects added to the container—such as cracks and the cosmic nebula emerging from the top—the logo remains unobscured and legible. This suggests that the edit was designed to preserve brand recognition while enhancing the visual impact. Based on common branding practices, manufacturers ensure logos remain prominent for product identification, and this image adheres to that principle.",

      "question": "Does the container retain its cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The container in Image B maintains its overall cylindrical form, though it has been artistically altered with cracks and a dynamic visual effect. While the top rim appears slightly distorted due to the 'cracked' aesthetic and the protruding nebula-like substance, the base and body of the container still follow the original cylindrical silhouette. In real-world packaging, containers like this are typically cylindrical for structural stability and manufacturing efficiency. The edits in Image B exaggerate certain features (like cracks) but do not fundamentally change the container’s underlying shape, which remains recognizably cylindrical.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the fiery red and energetic pink hues are still present in Image B. The label retains its original design elements, including sharp red angular patterns and vibrant pink accents that suggest an explosive or dynamic theme. These colors are consistent with the 'Spiked Up Look' branding, which aims to convey energy and intensity. Additionally, the contents spilling out of the container feature a swirling galaxy with similar red and pink tones, reinforcing the color scheme. This continuity in color palette suggests a deliberate artistic choice to maintain brand identity while introducing fantastical elements.",

      "question": "Is the net weight text (\"NET WT 2.64 OZ (75g)\") still visible on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The net weight text 'NET WT 2.64 OZ (75g)' is still visible on the label in Image B. It appears in small white font beneath the word 'PUTTY', just as it does in the original packaging. Although the label has been enhanced with additional visual effects—such as glowing stars and a cosmic background—the text remains readable and positioned in the same location. Product labeling regulations require such information to be legible, so its preservation aligns with both legal standards and consumer expectations. The edit does not obscure this detail, indicating careful attention to maintaining essential product information.",

      "question": "Is the container depicted as mostly intact, with only a crack allowing the nebula to be seen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No, the container is not depicted as mostly intact. Instead, it shows multiple cracks spreading across its surface, particularly around the top and sides, suggesting significant structural damage. The nebula-like substance is not just peeking through a single crack but appears to be bursting out in a dramatic fashion, filling the opening and even overflowing. This artistic representation goes beyond a minor fissure and implies a more extensive rupture. In reality, a cracked container would compromise product integrity, but here the cracks serve a stylistic purpose to emphasize the 'explosive' nature of the product. Thus, the container is portrayed as heavily damaged rather than merely cracked.",
