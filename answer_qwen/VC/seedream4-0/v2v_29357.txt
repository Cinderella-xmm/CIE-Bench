    "Question": "Q1: Is the child’s hair curly and light brown in color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the child's hair is visible around the sides of the head and under the beanie. The hair appears to have a wavy or slightly curly texture, and its color is a light brown shade, consistent with natural human hair tones. This observation is supported by the way the hair curls at the ends and the lighting reflecting off it, which indicates a soft, natural texture rather than straight or artificially styled hair. Based on visual cues and common knowledge about hair types and colors, this matches the description of curly and light brown hair.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the child have a visible face with a slightly open mouth and downward gaze?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the child’s face is clearly visible. The mouth is slightly open, which could indicate concentration or effort, typical when balancing on a skateboard. The eyes are looking downward toward the skateboard, suggesting focus on maintaining balance. This posture is consistent with someone actively engaged in skateboarding. These facial features are natural and align with expected behavior during such an activity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the child’s arms fully extended to the sides with palms facing down?",
    "explanation": "The child’s arms in Image B are stretched out horizontally to the sides, which is a common balancing technique used while skateboarding. The palms are oriented downward, as seen from the angle of the hands and fingers. This positioning helps maintain stability and balance, especially on uneven surfaces like snow. The extension and orientation of the arms match the described posture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the skateboard have a black top surface, wooden edges, and orange wheels?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is clearly visible beneath the child. The top surface is black, likely made of grip tape, which is standard for skateboards. The edges of the board appear to be made of wood, showing a natural wood grain finish. The wheels are orange in color, which is a distinctive feature. These characteristics—black grip tape, wooden deck, and orange wheels—are consistent with typical skateboard designs and are visually confirmed in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are both of the child’s feet placed on the skateboard, one near each end, with the board centered under the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both of the child’s feet are positioned on the skateboard. One foot is near the front end, and the other is near the back, forming a balanced stance. The skateboard is directly under the child’s body, indicating that it is centered for optimal balance. This stance is typical for beginners or young riders who need to maintain control and stability, especially on slippery surfaces like snow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the child’s arms and legs visible with natural skin tone and no artificial coloring?",
    "explanation": "The child’s arms and legs are fully visible in Image B. The skin tone appears consistent with natural human pigmentation, without any signs of unnatural hues, filters, or digital enhancement. The lighting is even, and there are no indications of artificial coloring or editing. The skin texture and shading suggest realistic human skin, which aligns with normal photographic representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there green leafy plants visible behind the child, with one tall plant on the left and dense shrubs on the right?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of snow-covered vegetation. The plants are covered in frost or snow, and their original green color is not visible. There is no indication of green leafy plants; instead, the environment is wintry, with white-frosted branches and dry grasses. This contrasts sharply with the presence of green foliage. Therefore, the description of green leafy plants does not match the actual visual content of Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
