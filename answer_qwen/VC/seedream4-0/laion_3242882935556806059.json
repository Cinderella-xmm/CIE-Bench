      "question": "Are the individual flower petals shaped like elongated, recurved lily petals with six distinct segments per bloom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers appear to be stylized representations of lilies, made from translucent, faceted crystal-like material. Each 'petal' is elongated and curved outward in a manner consistent with the typical shape of lily petals. The blooms exhibit six distinct petal-like segments per flower, which aligns with the natural structure of lilies. Although these are not organic flowers but artistic interpretations, their form closely mimics the anatomical features of real lilies—specifically the recurved, elongated petals and hexameric floral symmetry (six parts). This design choice reflects both botanical accuracy and aesthetic enhancement through crystalline materials. Therefore, despite being artificial, the shape matches the described characteristics.",

      "question": "Is the bouquet arranged in a tightly packed, spherical cluster with multiple flowers overlapping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the arrangement of the crystal flowers forms a dense, rounded mass that resembles a sphere. The individual blooms are closely grouped together, with many overlapping one another, creating a full and voluminous appearance. This tight packing is characteristic of a formal bouquet style, where flowers are clustered to maximize visual impact. The symmetry and density suggest intentional design to create a unified, spherical shape. Comparing this to typical floral arrangements, such a compact, overlapping structure is common in decorative bouquets, especially when using artificial or sculptural elements like crystals. Thus, the bouquet does indeed form a tightly packed, spherical cluster.",

      "question": "Is there a transparent, cylindrical glass vase holding the bouquet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container holding the bouquet is clearly visible. It is made of clear glass, allowing the water and stems inside to be seen. The shape is cylindrical, with straight sides and a uniform diameter from top to bottom, consistent with a standard glass vase. The transparency enables visibility of the internal components, including the water level and the stems or rods extending upward. This type of vase is commonly used for floral displays due to its simplicity and clarity, which enhances the visual appeal of both the flowers and their supporting structure. Based on these visual cues and general knowledge of vase design, the object is accurately described as a transparent, cylindrical glass vase.",

      "question": "Is the vase positioned directly beneath the bouquet, with stems/rods extending upward from it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is located at the base of the bouquet, directly supporting it. From within the vase, multiple slender, rod-like structures extend vertically upward into the flower heads. These rods serve as the structural support for the crystal flowers, mimicking the role of natural stems. Their alignment and extension from the vase confirm that they originate from within the vessel and rise to hold the blooms above. This setup is typical for artificial floral arrangements, where metal or plastic rods are used instead of biological stems. The positioning ensures stability and proper display of the bouquet. Therefore, the vase is indeed placed directly beneath the bouquet, with rods extending upward from it.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there approximately ten to twelve flowers visible in the bouquet, including both open blooms and closed buds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the bouquet consists of numerous individual flower units. While some are fully open, displaying all six facets of their crystal petals, others appear more compact and less expanded, resembling closed buds. Counting the distinct floral forms—considering both open blooms and bud-like structures—reveals a total that falls within the range of ten to twelve. The density and layering make exact counting challenging, but based on visible separations between blooms and the overall volume, this estimate is reasonable. In comparison to natural lily bouquets, such a number is typical for a medium-sized arrangement. Given the artistic nature of the piece, the number of flowers is consistent with a curated, decorative display intended to mimic a realistic bouquet. Thus, the count of approximately ten to twelve flowers, including both open and closed forms, is accurate.",
