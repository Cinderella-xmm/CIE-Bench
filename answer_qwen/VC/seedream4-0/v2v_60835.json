      "question": "Are the cheetahs still depicted in their original seated and standing postures on the earthen mound?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs are positioned similarly to their original postures in Image A: one is seated in front, and the other stands behind. However, the nature of their bodies has changed significantly due to mechanical modifications. The seated cheetah maintains a crouched position with its front paws forward and hind legs tucked beneath, consistent with a seated posture. The rear cheetah remains upright, mirroring the standing posture seen in the original. Despite these mechanical enhancements—such as metallic limbs and gear-like structures—the overall body orientation and relative positioning reflect the original postures. This conclusion is drawn from analyzing limb placement, body angle, and spatial relationship between the two animals.",

      "question": "Is the earthen mound still present beneath the cheetahs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The earthen mound is indeed still present beneath the cheetahs in Image B. It appears visually similar to the one in Image A—brown, textured, and cracked, indicating dry soil. Its shape and size are consistent with the original, providing a stable platform for both cheetahs. While the surrounding environment has been altered with fantastical elements like a steampunk tower, the mound itself remains unchanged in form and function. This assessment is based on visual continuity of texture, color, and structural role in supporting the animals.",

      "question": "Do the cheetahs retain their black-ringed tails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the cheetahs in Image B retain their black-ringed tails. Both cheetahs display the characteristic black bands along the tail, which are clearly visible despite the mechanical modifications to their bodies. The tail patterns remain consistent with natural cheetah anatomy, even though the tails are partially integrated with mechanical components. This observation aligns with biological knowledge that cheetahs naturally have such tail markings, and the artist has preserved this trait in the design, blending it with the steampunk aesthetic.",

      "question": "Does the background still feature a savanna landscape with greenery and a horizon line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the background in Image B retains elements of a savanna landscape—such as open grasslands and distant hills—it has been dramatically altered. The original greenery and natural horizon line are replaced by a fantastical steampunk cityscape with towering clockwork structures and industrial architecture. Although the terrain resembles a savanna in some areas (dry grass, scattered trees), the dominant features are artificial and surreal. Therefore, while remnants of the savanna exist, the background no longer accurately represents a natural savanna landscape with greenery and a clear horizon line as seen in Image A. This conclusion combines visual analysis with an understanding of environmental context and artistic transformation.",

      "question": "Is the relative positioning of the cheetahs (one seated in front, the other standing behind) maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the relative positioning of the cheetahs is maintained in Image B. The seated cheetah is in the foreground, slightly angled toward the viewer, while the standing cheetah is positioned directly behind it, looking off to the side. This arrangement mirrors the composition in Image A, where the same spatial hierarchy exists. Despite the addition of mechanical parts and changes in appearance, the spatial relationship between the two animals remains consistent. This judgment is based on analyzing depth cues, overlap, and alignment of the animals' bodies within the frame.",
