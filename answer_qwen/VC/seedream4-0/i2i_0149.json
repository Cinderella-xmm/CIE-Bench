      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's face and body clearly display the characteristic tabby pattern, which includes dark stripes and swirls over a lighter base coat. This pattern is especially visible on the head, forehead, and back. The tabby markings are consistent with typical domestic cats of this breed type. The visual cues such as the distinct 'M' shape on the forehead and striped patterns along the sides of the body confirm the presence of a tabby pattern. Based on world knowledge, tabby patterns are common in domestic cats and are genetically determined, often appearing in various forms such as classic, mackerel, or spotted. In this image, the pattern appears to be a mackerel or ticked tabby variant, given the narrow stripes running along the body. Therefore, the cat retains its tabby pattern.",

      "question": "Are the cat's eyes still vivid green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes are clearly visible and exhibit a bright, vivid green hue with a slight yellowish tint around the edges. The irises are well-defined, and the pupils are constricted, suggesting that the lighting conditions are relatively bright. The coloration is consistent with what is commonly seen in domestic cats, particularly those with green eyes, which can range from light lime to deeper emerald tones. Given the clarity and saturation of the eye color in the image, it is reasonable to conclude that the eyes remain vividly green. No signs of discoloration or blurring suggest any alteration in eye color. Thus, based on both visual evidence and general knowledge about feline eye colors, the eyes retain their vivid green appearance.",

      "question": "Is the cat's belly and chest area still white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat’s chest and belly region are clearly visible and appear to be predominantly white. The fur in these areas lacks any significant patches of color other than white, which is consistent with the typical coloration of many domestic cats that have a white underbelly. The contrast between the white fur and the darker tabby markings on the back and head further emphasizes the whiteness of the chest and belly. There are no visible stains, discolorations, or changes in pigmentation that would suggest otherwise. Based on common feline coat patterns, many cats have white chests and bellies even when their backs are patterned. This feature is preserved in the image, indicating that the cat's belly and chest area remain white.",

      "question": "Is the cat still positioned on the wooden surface in a relaxed lying posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is lying down on a flat, smooth surface that exhibits wood grain patterns and warm tones, indicative of a wooden surface. The cat’s body is stretched out comfortably, with its front paws extended forward and its head resting slightly elevated. This posture is typical of a relaxed state, where the cat is not tense or alert but rather at ease. The positioning of the limbs and the lack of tension in the body suggest a calm, restful pose. Additionally, the lighting highlights the contours of the cat’s body in a way that reinforces the sense of repose. From a behavioral standpoint, cats often lie in such postures when they feel safe and comfortable. Therefore, based on both visual cues and animal behavior knowledge, the cat remains in a relaxed lying posture on the wooden surface.",

      "question": "Are the fur texture and lighting effects on the cat and the wooden surface preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur texture of the cat is highly detailed, with individual strands visible, especially around the whiskers, ears, and legs. The lighting creates soft shadows and highlights that accentuate the natural texture of the fur, giving it a realistic, three-dimensional appearance. Similarly, the wooden surface beneath the cat shows clear grain patterns and subtle reflections of light, indicating a polished finish. These lighting effects contribute to depth and realism in the image. The interplay of light and shadow across both the cat and the surface suggests careful control of illumination, likely from a directional light source. Comparing this to typical high-quality pet photography standards, the preservation of fine details in both fur and surface textures indicates that these elements have been maintained. There are no signs of pixelation, blurring, or artificial smoothing that would degrade texture quality. Therefore, both the fur texture and lighting effects appear to be preserved.",
