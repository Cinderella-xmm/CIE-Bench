    "Question": "Q1: Is the blouse depicted in deep purple with silver floral embroidery?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top-left magnet shows a stylized representation of a blouse. The blouse is indeed depicted in deep purple and features silver embellishments that resemble floral or ornamental embroidery. This matches traditional Indian bridal attire design elements, where rich colors like deep purple are often paired with intricate silver zari or threadwork. The visual cues in the magnet—such as the color and pattern—are consistent with the description provided in the question. While this is a cartoonish depiction, the details align closely with the real-life blouse shown in Image A, which also has a deep purple base and silver embroidery. Therefore, based on both visual analysis and cultural knowledge of Indian fashion, the answer is yes.",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the lehenga feature vertical silver paisley motifs and a red inner lining at the hem?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the second row, first column magnet depicts a full lehenga. It shows a skirt with vertical patterns resembling paisley motifs in silver, which is a common decorative element in traditional Indian lehengas. Additionally, the bottom edge of the lehenga appears to have a red trim or lining, consistent with the description of a red inner lining at the hem. These details align with the actual lehenga in Image A, which also features silver paisley-like embroidery and a red border along the hem. The cartoon representation maintains key design elements seen in the original, indicating that the description is accurate.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the dupatta red with a silver zari border and scattered star-like embroidery?",
    "explanation": "The third magnet in the second row (center) shows a figure wearing a red dupatta with a silver border. The border appears to be intricately detailed, resembling zari work, which is typical for ceremonial dupattas. Additionally, there are small white dots or sparkles scattered across the red fabric, which can be interpreted as star-like embroidery. This matches the dupatta in Image A, which is red with a silver zari border and subtle star-like embellishments. The cartoon version simplifies but preserves these key features, making the description accurate.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the jewelry pieces including a central maang tikka and dangling earrings with pearls present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, several magnets depict figures wearing jewelry. The central figure in the second row wears a prominent headpiece that resembles a maang tikka, positioned on the forehead, which is consistent with traditional Indian bridal jewelry. Additionally, the earrings on multiple figures are dangling and include pearl-like elements, matching the description. In Image A, the model wears a similar maang tikka and pearl-studded earrings. The cartoon versions simplify the designs but retain the essential elements, confirming the presence of these jewelry items.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are multiple silver bangles visible on the right wrist?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the two red circular magnets in the bottom row depict stacked silver bangles. These are clearly shown as multiple bands, consistent with traditional Indian bridal bangles. However, these are not attached to a hand or wrist in the image—they are standalone representations. In Image A, the model does wear multiple silver bangles on her right wrist. While the cartoon version abstracts the bangles into separate icons, it still reflects the presence of multiple silver bangles, even if not directly on a wrist. Given that the question asks whether they are 'visible' and not necessarily 'on a wrist,' and considering the symbolic representation, the answer is yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the background wall patterned with a damask-style floral design in golden-brown tones?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a plain, light-colored surface (likely a refrigerator door) with no visible background wall. The magnets are arranged on a smooth, neutral-toned surface without any pattern. In contrast, Image A features a background wall with a damask-style floral design in golden-brown tones, which is a common decorative choice in Indian homes or studios for traditional photo shoots. Since Image B lacks any such background detail, the answer must be no. The absence of a patterned background in Image B contradicts the description, even though the original image had such a backdrop.",
    "answer": "No"
