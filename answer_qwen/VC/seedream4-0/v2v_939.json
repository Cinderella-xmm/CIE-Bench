      "question": "Is the drainpipe releasing water onto the ground visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a gray metal drainpipe is clearly visible on the left side of the frame. Water is shown flowing out of the pipe's elbow joint and falling onto the ground below, creating a splash and puddle. This aligns with real-world physics where rainwater from gutters drains through downspouts during rainfall. The presence of water flow and its impact on the wet ground confirms that the drainpipe is actively releasing water. The visual cues such as the stream of water and the wet surface beneath it support this conclusion.",

      "question": "Are the orange wall and brown door present in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a wall painted in a warm orange tone, consistent with the color seen in typical residential buildings. To the right of the scene, there is a brown wooden door with paneling and a metallic handle, which matches common architectural elements. These visual details are consistent across both images, suggesting continuity in setting. Based on world knowledge, such combinations of wall color and door style are common in European-style homes. Therefore, the orange wall and brown door are indeed present.",

      "question": "Does the chibi character wear a green raincoat and green boots in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is stylized in a chibi (super-deformed) art style, commonly used in animation and digital illustrations. Despite the cartoonish appearance, the character is clearly dressed in a green hooded raincoat with visible pockets and matching green rubber boots. The colors and clothing style are consistent with typical rainy-day attire for children. The green raincoat includes a hood that covers the head, and the boots are tall, waterproof, and colored green—features that match the description. Thus, based on visual inspection and common sense about rainwear, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Is the chibi character positioned in front of the wall and drainpipe in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character stands on the cobblestone ground, facing slightly toward the viewer, with the orange wall and the gray drainpipe located directly behind them. The spatial arrangement places the character between the viewer and the building structure, indicating they are in front of the wall and drainpipe. This positioning is logical given the perspective and depth cues in the image, such as the relative size and overlap of objects. From a real-world standpoint, people typically stand in front of walls when near buildings, especially during rain. Therefore, the character’s position is correctly interpreted as being in front of the wall and drainpipe.",

      "question": "Is the cobblestone ground texture visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ground in Image B shows a pattern of irregularly shaped stones arranged in a grid-like fashion, characteristic of cobblestone pavement. The surface is wet, reflecting light and showing water puddles, which enhances the visibility of the stone texture. This type of pavement is common in urban or historic areas and is often depicted in illustrations to suggest authenticity or charm. The reflections and shadows further confirm the textured nature of the surface. Hence, based on visual evidence and real-world knowledge of pavement materials, the cobblestone texture is clearly visible.",
