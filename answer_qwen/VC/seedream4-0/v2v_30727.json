      "question": "Does the zebra retain its black and white stripe pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is clearly visible with distinct black and white stripes covering its body, including its torso, legs, and head. The pattern is consistent with natural zebra striping, which is characterized by bold, alternating black and white bands. There are no visual distortions or color alterations that would suggest the pattern has been changed. This observation aligns with biological knowledge of zebras, whose stripe patterns are a defining feature and remain consistent across individuals. Therefore, based on visual evidence and world knowledge, the zebra retains its natural stripe pattern.",

      "question": "Is the zebra's body structure, including its legs and torso, intact?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's body appears anatomically correct. Its four legs are properly proportioned and positioned in a natural walking stance. The torso is well-formed, with no visible deformities or unnatural distortions. The limbs connect smoothly to the body, and the overall silhouette matches the expected morphology of a zebra. While there is a human figure partially visible near the zebra’s hind legs, this does not affect the zebra’s structural integrity. Based on visual analysis and zoological knowledge, the zebra's body structure remains intact.",

      "question": "Is the watering hole still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a body of water is visible along the bottom right edge of the frame, consistent with a small watering hole. The surface reflects light and shows ripples, indicating it is liquid. The surrounding soil is darkened near the edge, suggesting moisture, which supports the presence of a water source. This matches typical characteristics of a watering hole in a dry savanna environment. Thus, based on visual cues and ecological context, the watering hole is still present.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, large rounded rocks are clearly visible in the background, arranged in a cluster behind the zebra. These rocks are consistent in texture and color with those seen in arid or semi-arid environments. The ground is covered in dry, sandy soil with sparse vegetation, matching the dry earth background seen in many African savannas. The lighting and shadows confirm the continuity of the terrain. Therefore, based on visual evidence and environmental context, the surrounding rocks and dry earth background are still visible.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's tail is long, slender, and ends in a tuft of hair, which is consistent with the natural anatomy of a zebra. The tail is extended downward and slightly curved, as would be expected when a zebra is walking. It appears to be in motion, possibly swishing, which is typical behavior for zebras. There is no sign of distortion, unnatural curvature, or digital manipulation. Based on zoological knowledge and visual inspection, the tail maintains its natural shape and position.",
