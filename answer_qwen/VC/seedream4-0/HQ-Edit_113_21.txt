    "Question": "Q4: Is the woman leaning on a wooden staff?",
    "explanation": "In the top-left panel of Image B, the woman is depicted holding a long, slender object in her right hand that appears to be a wooden staff. It extends vertically downward and is positioned under her arm, suggesting she is using it for support. This aligns with cultural practices where elderly individuals, especially in traditional societies, use walking sticks or staffs as symbols of wisdom and mobility aid.

    "Question": "Q5: Is there a hut with a thatched roof and mud walls present in the image?",
    "explanation": "The top-left panel of Image B shows the woman standing in front of a structure made of woven reeds or dried grasses, forming a wall that resembles a traditional hut. While the material does not appear to be mud (which would have a more solid, earthy texture), it is consistent with a thatched construction. The roof is clearly made of straw or similar natural materials, sloping downward in a typical thatched style. Although the wall texture differs slightly from mud, the overall structure matches the general appearance of a traditional African hut. However, due to the stylized nature of the artwork, the material interpretation may vary slightly.",

    "Question": "Q6: Is the figure clearly a human woman in a standing position?",
    "explanation": "All three panels in Image B depict figures that are unmistakably human. In the top-left and top-right panels, the woman is shown in full or partial profile, standing upright with distinct human features such as facial structure, limbs, and posture. The bottom panel shows a silhouette, but the shape clearly indicates a human form with a head, torso, arms, and legs, consistent with a standing woman. The presence of a staff further supports the interpretation of a standing individual. There is no ambiguity in identifying the figure as a human woman in a standing pose.",

    "Question": "Q7: Are the dominant colors in the woman’s attire warm tones such as orange, red, and yellow?",
    "explanation": "Across all panels in Image B, the woman’s clothing and accessories are dominated by warm hues. Her dress, shawl, headwrap, and beaded necklaces feature strong shades of orange, red, and yellow, with occasional accents of green and blue. These warm tones are central to the visual composition and are characteristic of traditional African textiles, which often emphasize bold, vibrant colors. Even in the stylized bottom panel, the silhouette is set against a background rich in warm and cool contrasts, but the original attire remains true to warm color dominance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
