      "question": "Is the circular orb-web with clearly defined radial and concentric threads still present and structurally intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the web is clearly visible as a large, symmetrical structure spanning between the branches. The radial threads extend from the center outward in a consistent pattern, and concentric circles are also discernible, forming a classic orb-web design. Despite the fantastical transformation of the spider into a jeweled, winged creature, the web itself remains geometrically coherent and structurally intact. There are no visible breaks or distortions in the thread pattern. This suggests that the web’s foundational architecture has been preserved even though the central occupant has been artistically altered. Based on visual cues, the web maintains its integrity as a functional orb-web.",

      "question": "Are the branches positioned in a natural arc around the web, supporting it from multiple directions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branches form a semi-circular arrangement around the web, with several points of contact anchoring the web's outer edges. These branches appear to be naturally curved and extend from different angles, providing structural support to the web. The positioning mimics how real orb-webs are often suspended between vegetation—using multiple anchor points for stability. The spatial distribution of the branches supports the web from various directions, contributing to its balanced suspension. This configuration is consistent with natural web-building behavior, where spiders use surrounding plant structures for support. Therefore, the branch placement appears both natural and functionally appropriate.",

      "question": "Do the leaves retain their oval shape, visible venation, and glossy surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the leaves maintain an oval shape similar to those seen in many shrubs or evergreen plants. Fine lines resembling leaf veins are visible across the surfaces, indicating attention to anatomical detail. Additionally, the surface of the leaves exhibits a subtle sheen, suggesting a glossy texture, which is typical of healthy foliage under diffused lighting. While the overall scene has a stylized quality due to the magical spider, the leaves themselves remain botanically plausible in form and texture. The rendering preserves realistic botanical features despite the fantasy context.",

      "question": "Are there small, clear water droplets visible on the surfaces of some leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon careful observation of the leaf surfaces, especially along the edges and tips, tiny translucent droplets can be seen clinging to the leaves. These droplets reflect light and have a spherical shape, consistent with dew or moisture condensation. Their presence adds to the realism of the scene, suggesting early morning conditions or high humidity. Although the artistic style enhances the fantasy elements, these droplets are rendered with enough clarity and physical plausibility to be identifiable as water. Thus, they are present and contribute to the environmental atmosphere.",

      "question": "Is the background a soft, uniform pale blue-gray sky without additional elements such as clouds or sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is indeed a smooth gradient of pale blue-gray, devoid of distinct clouds, sun, or other atmospheric features. It provides a neutral backdrop that emphasizes the foreground elements—the web, branches, and the fantastical spider. The lack of sharp contrasts or directional light sources like the sun suggests diffuse lighting conditions, possibly overcast skies. This uniformity helps focus attention on the central subject while maintaining a serene and ethereal mood. No additional celestial or meteorological elements are introduced, so the background remains simple and consistent with the description.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the web’s radial threads visibly connected to the branch ends at multiple points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the radial threads of the web extend outward from the center and terminate at the ends of the surrounding branches. Multiple connection points are visible where the threads attach to the twigs, ensuring the web’s stability. These anchor points are distributed evenly around the perimeter, which is typical for orb-webs built in nature. The threads appear taut and securely fastened, suggesting a functional attachment. Even though the spider has been transformed into a decorative, fairy-like creature, the web’s structural connections remain visually accurate and consistent with real-world arachnid engineering.",
