      "question": "Is the subject’s hair light blonde in color and visibly full and styled upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted as a stylized, cartoon-like character with exaggerated features. The hair is clearly light blonde in color, consistent with the original individual's known hair color. It is also visibly full and styled upward in a prominent, combed-back manner, which is characteristic of the individual's iconic hairstyle. This styling is emphasized in the cartoon rendering, where the hair is given a voluminous, almost sculpted appearance that rises above the head. The visual cues—such as the bright yellowish-blond hue and the upward sweep—are unmistakable and align with both real-world knowledge and the artistic exaggeration typical in animated portrayals.",

      "question": "Does the subject have a prominent forehead and wide jawline that define the facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's face is rendered in a cartoon style with exaggerated proportions. The forehead is indeed prominent, appearing broad and rounded, which is a common stylistic choice in caricatures to emphasize certain features. The jawline is also wide and defined, contributing to a strong, angular lower face. These features are amplified compared to natural proportions, but they reflect an intentional exaggeration based on recognizable traits of the individual. In contrast, while the real person has a distinct facial structure, the cartoon version uses these traits more dramatically for comedic or illustrative effect. Thus, the prominence of the forehead and jawline is visually clear in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the subject’s right hand raised with the palm facing outward and fingers spread in a waving motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's right hand is clearly raised, with the palm facing outward and fingers spread apart. This gesture is consistent with a waving motion, commonly used to greet or acknowledge an audience. The hand is positioned at approximately shoulder height, reinforcing the impression of a deliberate wave. The animation style enhances this action, making the gesture appear dynamic and expressive. Comparing this to Image A, the real person also raises their right hand in a similar waving motion, though less exaggerated. The cartoon version retains the core action but amplifies it for visual impact, confirming the accuracy of the description.",

      "question": "Is there a necktie visible under the suit jacket, positioned at the front of the shirt collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is wearing a colorful, patterned suit jacket over a white shirt. A necktie is clearly visible beneath the jacket, positioned at the front of the shirt collar. The tie is red with decorative patterns, matching the vibrant aesthetic of the outfit. While the tie is not identical in style to the one worn in Image A (which was blue), its presence and placement are consistent with formal attire. The cartoon rendering maintains the structural elements of formal wear, including the necktie, even if it is stylized. Therefore, the answer is affirmative based on the visual evidence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is wearing a suit jacket, but it is not dark in color—it is brightly colored with a multicolored, psychedelic pattern. This contrasts sharply with the dark formal suit seen in Image A. While the jacket is still structured like a suit and worn over a white shirt, its coloration and design are highly stylized and not 'dark' in the traditional sense. Therefore, although the garment resembles a suit jacket, it does not meet the criteria of being 'dark formal.' The answer must reflect the actual visual content of Image B, not assumptions based on Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's eyes are large and cartoonishly drawn, looking directly forward with a slight tilt toward the viewer’s left. This directionality is consistent with the gaze of the real person in Image A, who also looks slightly to the left from the viewer's perspective. However, in the cartoon version, the eyes are more exaggerated and simplified, yet the overall orientation remains the same. The alignment of the pupils and the angle of the eyes confirm that the gaze is forward and angled slightly to the left, maintaining the intended focus and expression.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is positioned slightly to the right of the center of the frame, standing on what appears to be a stage or platform. The posture suggests movement forward, as the body is angled toward the viewer and the arms are extended in a dynamic pose. This positioning mirrors the real-life scene in Image A, where the individual is walking forward through a crowd. The cartoon version emphasizes this forward motion through stance and gesture, reinforcing the impression of progression. The background elements, such as the crowd and balloons, further support the idea that the subject is moving into the scene.",
