      "question": "Is the bird positioned in a side-facing profile, facing left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is clearly shown in a side-facing profile. Its head is turned toward the left side of the frame, and its body is aligned horizontally along the branch. The orientation of its beak, eye, and feathers all indicate that it is facing left. This is consistent with typical avian anatomy and visual representation in art, where a side profile allows for clear visibility of features like the eye, beak, and wing structure. There is no indication of frontal or rear-facing posture. Therefore, based on the visual cues and common knowledge of animal depiction, the bird is indeed facing left.",

      "question": "Are the birdâ€™s feet visibly gripping the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's feet are clearly visible and appear to be gripping the branch. The claws are extended and wrapped around the branch, showing a natural perching behavior. The positioning of the toes and the slight curvature suggest active grip, which is typical for birds when perched. This detail is rendered with sufficient clarity to confirm that the feet are not merely resting but actively holding onto the branch. This observation aligns with biological knowledge of how birds maintain balance on branches.",

      "question": "Does the main branch extend diagonally from the lower-left to the upper-right of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main branch starts from the lower-left portion of the image and extends upward toward the upper-right corner. It follows a diagonal trajectory across the frame, forming an angle that is approximately 45 degrees. This directional flow is visually prominent and contributes to the composition's dynamic balance. The placement of the bird and blossoms along this branch further emphasizes its diagonal path. Based on spatial analysis of the image elements, the branch does indeed extend from the lower-left to the upper-right.",

      "question": "Are there multiple clusters of blossoms distributed along the side branches of the main twig?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side branches extending from the main twig feature several clusters of blossoms. These blossoms are grouped in small bunches along the smaller twigs, particularly on both the left and right sides of the main branch. Each cluster consists of multiple flower-like structures, some of which appear to be glowing or emitting light, suggesting a stylized or fantastical interpretation. The distribution is uneven but clearly present in multiple locations, confirming that there are indeed multiple clusters. This pattern is consistent with natural floral growth, though exaggerated here for artistic effect.",

      "question": "Are white snowflakes visible falling throughout the sky background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, numerous white snowflake shapes are scattered across the sky background. These snowflakes vary in size and opacity, creating the impression of falling snow. Some are detailed with six-pointed crystalline patterns, while others are more abstract or blurred, simulating motion. Their presence throughout the entire background suggests continuous snowfall. This visual element is consistent with winter scenes and reinforces the contrast between the fiery bird and the cold environment. The snowflakes are clearly visible and contribute to the overall atmosphere of the image.",

      "question": "Is the background a uniform pale blue sky without clouds or gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is predominantly a pale blue color, resembling a clear sky. However, upon closer inspection, there is a subtle gradient effect, with the blue being slightly lighter near the top and gradually deepening toward the bottom. Additionally, the presence of snowflakes adds texture to the background, but no distinct cloud formations are visible. While the sky appears mostly uniform, the gradient and snowflakes introduce minor variations. Therefore, although the background is primarily pale blue, it is not entirely uniform due to the gradient and snowflake distribution.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is positioned roughly in the center of the frame, balanced along the diagonal branch. The branch extends from the lower-left to the upper-right, and the bird sits approximately midway along this path. On both the left and right sides of the bird, there are side branches bearing blossoms. The left side has multiple clusters of glowing flowers, and the right side also features similar floral elements. This symmetrical distribution of blossoms around the central bird enhances the visual balance of the composition. Thus, the bird is centrally located, and blossoms are present on both sides of the branch.",
