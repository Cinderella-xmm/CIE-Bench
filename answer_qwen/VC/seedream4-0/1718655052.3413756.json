      "question": "Are the dog's large, round, black eyes clearly visible and positioned symmetrically on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is constructed from LEGO bricks, forming a stylized representation. The eyes are made of black circular pieces that are large and round, consistent with typical LEGO animal designs. They are placed symmetrically on either side of the face, aligned horizontally and vertically with respect to the centerline of the head. This symmetry is evident due to the modular nature of LEGO construction, which emphasizes balance and proportion. Based on visual inspection, the eyes are clearly visible and symmetrically positioned.",

      "question": "Is the dog's black nose clearly present and centered on the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nose in Image B is represented by a small black LEGO piece shaped like a rounded rectangle or oval, positioned at the center of the snout area. It is located directly between the two eyes and aligned with the vertical axis of the face, indicating central placement. Given the blocky, geometric design of LEGO models, the nose is simplified but still clearly defined and centered, as expected in such constructions for facial symmetry.",

      "question": "Is the dog's mouth open, revealing a pink tongue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouth is depicted using a small red LEGO piece placed below the nose, suggesting an open mouth. However, this red piece does not extend inward to represent a tongue; instead, it appears as a flat surface. There is no indication of depth or protrusion that would suggest a visible pink tongue. The representation is minimalistic and abstract, typical of LEGO models, where internal details like tongues are often omitted. Therefore, while the mouth appears open, a pink tongue is not visibly present.",

      "question": "Are both ears floppy and positioned symmetrically on either side of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ears in Image B are constructed from light-colored LEGO bricks and extend outward from the sides of the head. They appear to be slightly angled downward, giving them a floppy appearance. Both ears are identical in shape, size, and positioning relative to the head’s centerline, indicating symmetry. The use of uniform LEGO elements ensures balanced placement, consistent with the overall design of the model. Thus, the ears are both floppy and symmetrically placed.",

      "question": "Is there a dark collar with a visible silver-colored metal ring around the dog’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog wears a black band around its neck, which represents a collar. This band is made of black LEGO pieces and is clearly visible. However, there is no silver-colored metal ring present on the collar. Instead, the collar appears to be a solid band without any attached hardware. LEGO models typically avoid realistic metallic components unless specifically designed, and in this case, no such ring is included. Therefore, while the collar exists, the silver ring is absent.",

      "question": "Is the hat positioned on the dog’s head with two white pom-poms visible on either side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hat in Image B is a brown, textured LEGO structure resembling a winter cap with a wooden grain pattern. It sits securely on top of the dog’s head. At the top of the hat, there is a single white pom-pom made of stacked LEGO studs. However, there are no additional pom-poms visible on either side of the hat. The sides of the hat are smooth and lack any decorative elements like side pom-poms. Therefore, only one pom-pom is present, not two.",

      "question": "Is the scarf wrapped around the dog’s neck, forming a visible loop or knot at the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scarf in Image B is made of orange and brown LEGO pieces and wraps around the dog’s neck. It features a central section that extends forward, forming a distinct loop or knot-like structure. This loop is composed of layered bricks and has a decorative pattern, resembling a traditional scarf knot. The design is intentional and clearly visible, indicating that the scarf is tied in a way that creates a recognizable front knot. This aligns with common LEGO design practices for accessories.",

      "question": "Is the dog facing directly toward the camera with a slight upward tilt of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is positioned upright on a flat surface, with its face oriented straight ahead toward the viewer. The head is slightly tilted upward, as indicated by the angle of the eyes and the positioning of the snout relative to the base of the body. This upward tilt is subtle but noticeable, especially when comparing the alignment of the eyes and the horizon line. The pose is deliberate and frontal, typical of display models, ensuring the face is fully visible. Therefore, the dog is facing directly forward with a slight upward head tilt.",
