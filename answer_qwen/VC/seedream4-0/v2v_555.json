      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe contains miniature models of two globally recognized landmarks: the Colosseum and Big Ben. The Colosseum is depicted with its characteristic elliptical shape, multiple arches, and tiered structure, which are defining features of the ancient Roman amphitheater. Big Ben is represented with its iconic clock tower, pointed spire, and visible clock face, all of which are unmistakable elements of London’s Elizabeth Tower. These architectural details are clearly distinguishable even in miniature form, allowing viewers to immediately recognize both structures. Given their well-known silhouettes and structural traits, they remain highly recognizable as symbolic representations of Rome and London, respectively. This recognition is supported by common cultural knowledge about these landmarks.",

      "question": "Do the shapes and details of the Colosseum and Big Ben remain intact within the snow globe depiction?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B presents both the Colosseum and Big Ben in a scaled-down form. The Colosseum retains its layered arcades and overall oval shape, consistent with historical depictions. Similarly, Big Ben's tower includes the clock face, vertical columns, and pointed roof, preserving key architectural details. While some fine textures may be simplified due to the miniature scale, the essential structural forms and proportions are accurately maintained. This suggests that the model designers prioritized fidelity to the original buildings’ outlines and significant features. Thus, despite being reduced in size, the core shapes and identifiable details of both landmarks are preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a snow globe placed on a wooden surface. There are no visible white cups or saucers in this image. Instead, the scene has been transformed from the original latte art setup into a decorative snow globe containing miniature versions of the Colosseum and Big Ben. The absence of any coffee-related items indicates that the original elements (the cups and saucers) have been completely replaced by the new object. Therefore, based on visual evidence and logical inference, the white cups and saucers are not present in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe rests on a wooden surface that exhibits a warm brown tone and visible wood grain patterns. This surface matches the appearance of the wooden table seen in Image A. Although the context has changed from coffee cups to a snow globe, the table remains visually consistent in texture and color. The continuity of the background surface suggests it was retained during the edit. Therefore, the wooden table surface is indeed still visible in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the brown tones of the latte art preserved in the snow globe design?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the latte art features rich brown tones derived from the espresso and milk foam, with intricate designs resembling the Colosseum and Big Ben. In Image B, the snow globe contains miniature models of these structures made from materials such as resin or plastic, which appear in earthy brown hues similar to those in the original latte art. However, the brown tones in the snow globe are not from coffee but rather from the material used for the models. While the color palette is conceptually consistent—using browns to represent the historic stone of the monuments—the source of the color has changed. Nevertheless, the visual effect of brown tones representing the landmarks is preserved in spirit, even if not literally from latte art. Given that the question asks whether the brown tones are preserved, and considering the visual similarity in coloration, the answer is affirmative in terms of aesthetic continuity.",
