    "Question": "Q1: Is the angular, multi-tiered headdress with symmetrical side flaps present and unchanged in shape and position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central object is a large, futuristic digital billboard or display structure with glowing blue and pink neon patterns. There is no visible headdress or any facial feature resembling a head. The structure is geometric and technological in design, lacking any organic or anthropomorphic elements such as a headdress. Therefore, based on visual analysis, the angular, multi-tiered headdress with symmetrical side flaps is not present at all. This conclusion is drawn by comparing the current object to typical representations of headdresses—such as those seen in ancient Egyptian or sci-fi designs—and noting that none of these features exist here.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the eyes glowing amber in color and positioned symmetrically within the face?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not contain a face or any facial features. Instead, it shows a massive digital screen displaying abstract data and circuit-like patterns in blue and magenta hues. There are no eyes, let alone glowing amber ones. The absence of any human or humanoid features makes it impossible for eyes to be present. In contrast, if we were to reference Image A (which contains a robotic head with glowing amber eyes), such features would be evident. However, in Image B, the entire composition lacks any facial symmetry or ocular structures. Thus, the answer is clearly 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the stepped stone pedestal base present with distinct horizontal layers forming a pyramidal shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the structure is a modern, angular platform made of reflective metallic materials, illuminated with neon lights. It has sharp edges and a sleek, futuristic design, but it does not resemble a stepped stone pedestal. There are no visible horizontal layers forming a pyramidal shape as described. Instead, the base appears to be a single, solid block with some geometric angles. In contrast, Image A features a clear stepped stone pedestal with layered tiers that rise upward in a pyramidal fashion. This difference is significant, and based on visual cues alone, the stepped stone pedestal is absent in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the segmented mechanical joints visible along the neck, beneath a translucent casing?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains no neck or mechanical joint components. The structure shown is a large, boxy digital display with glowing lines and panels. There is no indication of a neck or any part resembling a mechanical articulation system. The lower portion of the structure is solid and non-articulated. In comparison, Image A displays a robotic figure with a visible neck featuring segmented joints under what appears to be a translucent casing. Since Image B lacks any such anatomy, the presence of segmented mechanical joints cannot be confirmed. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the head oriented directly forward, facing the viewer without rotation or tilt?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not contain a head. The central object is a large digital screen mounted on a platform, angled slightly toward the viewer but not resembling a head. Without a head or facial orientation, the concept of facing forward or being rotated is irrelevant. In Image A, the head is indeed oriented directly forward, centered in the frame, and facing the viewer. However, since Image B lacks this feature entirely, the question cannot apply. Hence, the correct answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the face symmetrically structured with aligned nose, lips, and jawline?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not contain a face. The structure is a high-tech digital display with no facial features such as a nose, lips, or jawline. Symmetry in facial features cannot be assessed because there are no such features present. In contrast, Image A presents a highly symmetrical robotic face with well-defined and balanced facial elements. Since Image B lacks any facial structure, it cannot possess symmetrical facial alignment. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the head positioned directly atop the stepped pedestal, supported by it without floating or being detached?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not have a head or a stepped pedestal. Instead, it has a large digital screen mounted on a modern, angular base. The screen is firmly attached to the base, but it is not a head nor is the base stepped or pyramidal. The structure appears stable and grounded, but it does not match the description of a head resting on a stepped pedestal. In Image A, the head is clearly placed on top of a stepped stone pedestal, which supports it fully. Since Image B lacks both the head and the specific pedestal type, the condition described in the question is not met. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
