    "Question": "Q1: Is the tabletop still circular in shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop appears to be circular in shape, as it has a round, gear-like edge with a symmetrical pattern radiating from the center. The design includes intricate mechanical elements such as cogs and ornamental engravings, but the overall outline maintains a consistent circular form. This is consistent with typical steampunk-inspired designs that preserve traditional shapes while adding elaborate details. Based on visual inspection, the tabletop retains its circular geometry despite the added complexity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does a single vertical column extend from the center of the tabletop to the base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a central vertical structure that connects the tabletop to the base. This column is cylindrical and positioned directly beneath the center of the tabletop. It is constructed from metal components, including brass and copper, and integrates pipes and gears into its design. Despite the complex mechanical appearance, the column remains singular and centrally aligned, fulfilling the function of supporting the tabletop above the base. This aligns with the structural logic of a table where load is transferred through a central post.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the base consist of five symmetrically arranged legs forming a star shape?",
    "explanation": "The base in Image B does not consist of five symmetrically arranged legs. Instead, it features four articulated, mechanical legs that resemble robotic limbs. These legs are connected to the central column via joints and pistons, and they are not evenly spaced or symmetrically aligned in a star formation. The base also includes a large circular platform embedded with gears and clockwork mechanisms, which serves as a foundation. Therefore, the leg arrangement deviates significantly from a five-pointed star shape.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are there small black rubber feet at the tip of each leg?",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the tips of the four mechanical legs appear to have dark, rounded components. However, these are not simple rubber feet; instead, they resemble conical metal caps or nozzles, possibly designed for stability or aesthetic effect. There is no visible evidence of soft, black rubber material typically associated with rubber feet. Given the steampunk style, the materials used are likely metallic or hard plastic rather than rubber. Thus, the presence of small black rubber feet cannot be confirmed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the height of the central column approximately equal to the diameter of the tabletop?",
    "explanation": "To assess this, we compare the vertical length of the central column to the horizontal span of the tabletop. In Image B, the central column is relatively tall and extends from the tabletop down to the base, which is elevated due to the mechanical legs. The tabletop's diameter appears to be similar in scale to the height of the column, though slightly larger. However, given the artistic and exaggerated proportions common in steampunk designs, the column's height seems roughly comparable to the tabletop's diameter. A precise measurement isn't possible, but visually, the two dimensions are nearly equal.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the main body of the table still made of a shiny, silver-colored metal?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the main body of the table is not made of shiny, silver-colored metal. Instead, it features a combination of brass, copper, and darker metals with patina finishes. The central column, legs, and base exhibit warm tones of bronze and copper, with some parts appearing oxidized or aged. While there are reflective surfaces, the dominant coloration is not silver but rather golden-brown and dark metallic hues characteristic of steampunk aesthetics. This contrasts sharply with the typical stainless steel or chrome finish seen in modern tables.",
    "answer": "No"
