    "Question": "Q1: Is the wall behind the objects still light blue?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wall behind the figures is visually consistent with a light blue hue. This can be determined by observing the color gradient and tone of the wall surface, which matches the typical appearance of a light blue painted wall commonly found in nurseries or children's rooms. The lighting in the room casts soft shadows, but the base color remains unchanged from what would be expected in such an environment. There are no visual cues indicating a change in wall color, such as patches, discoloration, or new paint. Based on common sense and the continuity of the scene (including the crib and carpet), it is reasonable to conclude that the wall color has not been altered.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the white crib with vertical bars and a curved headboard remain in the image?",
    "explanation": "The crib in Image B retains its original structure: it features vertical bars, a curved headboard with rounded finials at the top corners, and a light-colored wooden frame. These design elements are consistent with those seen in Image A, suggesting continuity in the setting. The crib is positioned in the same location relative to the wall and floor, reinforcing that it has not been removed or replaced. The presence of the mattress with a patterned cover further supports that this is the same crib. Therefore, based on visual consistency and structural details, the crib remains in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the crib mattress still patterned with yellow and gray cloud designs?",
    "explanation": "Observing the crib mattress in Image B, the fabric covering displays a repeating pattern of yellow and gray shapes that resemble clouds. This matches the description of the pattern in Image A. Despite the change in the foreground figures (from stuffed animals to knights), the mattress retains the same design, color scheme, and layout. The pattern is clearly visible through the crib bars and aligns with typical nursery-themed bedding. Given that the crib itself has not changed, and the mattress appears intact and undisturbed, it is logical to conclude that the patterned design remains unchanged.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the new figures (medieval knights) still positioned along the wall near the crib, maintaining their relative alignment?",
    "explanation": "The three medieval knight figures in Image B are seated in a row along the base of the wall, directly adjacent to the crib, just as the stuffed animals were in Image A. Their positioning mirrors the original alignment—left to right, evenly spaced, and facing forward. They maintain a similar distance from the wall and the crib, preserving the spatial relationship established in the original scene. Although the figures themselves are different (knights instead of plush toys), their placement follows the same compositional logic: centered in the foreground, aligned horizontally, and positioned parallel to the wall. This suggests intentional preservation of the scene’s layout despite the transformation of the subjects.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the floor still covered with a beige carpet?",
    "explanation": "The flooring in Image B shows a consistent texture and color throughout the visible area. It is a soft, low-pile carpet with a beige or light tan hue, matching the carpet seen in Image A. The carpet extends beneath both the figures and the crib, and there are no signs of tiles, wood, or other materials replacing it. Additionally, the way light reflects off the surface and the shadow patterns cast by the figures support the presence of a carpeted floor. Since no changes in material or color are evident, and the environment remains a nursery-like setting, it is reasonable to conclude that the beige carpet remains unchanged.",
    "answer": "Yes"
