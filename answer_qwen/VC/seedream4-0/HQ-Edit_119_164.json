      "question": "Are the flat-topped acacia trees visible in the background, maintaining their characteristic silhouette and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features several trees with flat, umbrella-like canopies, which are consistent with the typical appearance of flat-topped acacia trees (such as Acacia tortilis), commonly found in African savannas. These trees are spaced apart at intervals that resemble natural distribution patterns in such ecosystems. Their silhouettes are clearly defined against the warm sky, and they retain the iconic shape associated with this species. While the artistic style enhances the visual drama, the essential form and spacing remain recognizable and faithful to real-world expectations. Therefore, despite the fantastical elements on the elephant, the background vegetation remains consistent with natural representation.",

      "question": "Is the tall, golden-brown savanna grass present throughout the foreground and midground, matching the original texture and density?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foreground and midground of Image B display a field of tall, golden-brown grass, which is visually consistent with savanna vegetation. The grass appears dense and textured, with individual blades showing variation in height and direction, contributing to a realistic natural feel. Although the lighting and color saturation are enhanced due to the magical aesthetic of the image, the overall structure and density of the grass align with what one would expect in a typical African savanna landscape during sunset. There is no indication of unnatural thinning or absence of grass, and the continuity across the scene supports its presence throughout the lower half of the image.",

      "question": "Does the sky display a continuous gradient from warm orange near the horizon to deep red and purple at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B shows a smooth and dramatic transition of colors, starting with bright orange and yellow hues near the horizon, blending into deeper reds, and finally transitioning into rich purples and dark blues at the upper edge of the frame. This gradient is typical of a sunset or sunrise in arid regions like the African savanna, where atmospheric scattering produces such vivid color shifts. The gradient is continuous and well-distributed, without abrupt changes or inconsistencies, reinforcing the realism of the lighting conditions even within the stylized context of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the horizon line clearly visible and straight, dividing the sky from the savanna landscape at approximately one-third up the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horizon line is clearly defined and runs horizontally across the image, separating the sky from the land. It is positioned roughly one-third of the way up from the bottom, which is a common compositional choice in landscape photography and art to emphasize both sky and ground. The line is straight and uninterrupted by obstructions, allowing for a clean division between the celestial and terrestrial elements. This alignment supports a balanced and harmonious composition, consistent with standard visual principles used in nature scenes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting consistent with a low-angle sunset, producing warm highlights on the upper surfaces of the elephant and grass, and casting long shadows behind the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B strongly suggests a low-angle sunset. Warm, golden light illuminates the upper portions of the elephant’s body and the tops of the grass, while the undersides and areas behind the elephant are in shadow. This directional lighting creates depth and volume, typical of late afternoon or early evening sun. Additionally, the long shadows cast behind the elephant reinforce the idea of a sun near the horizon. Even though the elephant has supernatural elements (like glowing stars), the base lighting logic remains consistent with natural sunset illumination, enhancing the believability of the scene.",

      "question": "Is the elephant positioned centrally in the frame, facing directly toward the viewer with its body aligned vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in Image B is centered within the composition, occupying the middle of the frame both horizontally and vertically. Its head and trunk are oriented directly forward, facing the viewer, and its body appears upright and symmetrical. This central positioning emphasizes the elephant as the focal point of the image, drawing attention to its fantastical features. Despite the added cosmic textures and wings, the animal's posture and alignment remain consistent with a direct frontal view, maintaining balance and visual impact.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there no visible water bodies, rocky outcrops, or other animals in the background beyond the acacia trees and grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the background in Image B, there are no visible water bodies such as rivers or lakes, nor any rocky outcrops or hills. The terrain consists solely of open savanna grassland dotted with acacia trees. There are also no signs of other animals—such as birds, antelopes, or predators—in the distance. The focus remains entirely on the elephant and the surrounding flora, with the background kept minimal and uncluttered. This simplicity reinforces the mystical and isolated atmosphere of the scene, aligning with the intent of highlighting the transformed elephant.",

      "question": "Do the grass blades in the foreground show individual strands with slight variation in length and direction, contributing to a natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grass in the foreground of Image B exhibits detailed rendering, with individual blades discernible and varying in length, thickness, and orientation. Some blades lean slightly forward or backward, mimicking natural wind movement and growth patterns. This level of detail adds depth and realism to the texture, preventing it from appearing uniformly flat or artificial. The subtle variations enhance the sense of a living, dynamic environment, even within the stylized and magical context of the image.",
