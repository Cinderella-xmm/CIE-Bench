    "Question": "Q1: Is the black knit beanie present on the head of the figure in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is a stylized, cartoon-like character with exaggerated features typical of chibi or collectible figurines. The character wears a light brown or tan-colored hat, which resembles a fedora or explorer-style hat, not a black knit beanie. A black knit beanie would have a ribbed texture and a snug fit, which is inconsistent with the smooth, wide-brimmed appearance of the hat shown. Based on visual cues and common knowledge about clothing types, this is clearly not a beanie. Therefore, the black knit beanie is absent.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the backpack brown in color and positioned over both shoulders with visible straps?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is wearing a backpack that appears to be brown in color, consistent with leather or canvas material. The straps are visible and extend over both shoulders, as seen from the front view of the character. The backpack has a classic design with two shoulder straps, which are symmetrical and properly positioned. This aligns with typical backpack designs used in animated or stylized figures. There is no indication of asymmetry or missing straps, so both are visible and correctly placed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the eyes positioned in the same relative location on the face as in the original image, with a clear gaze direction toward the right?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure has large, round eyes typical of chibi-style characters, positioned high on the face. However, due to the stylization, the eye placement differs significantly from realistic human proportions. In contrast, Image A shows a real person with natural eye placement and a subtle gaze directed slightly to the right. In Image B, the eyes are centered and symmetrically placed, with no clear directional gazeâ€”instead, they appear to look directly forward. Therefore, the eye positioning and gaze direction differ substantially from the original image. The artistic style alters anatomical realism, making direct comparison invalid in terms of natural gaze.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the figure wear a dark-colored jacket with a visible front zipper and collar?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is wearing a jacket that is olive green in color, not dark (such as black or navy). It has a visible front closure, but it appears to be a buttoned or snap-fastened design rather than a zipper. Additionally, the collar is present but not prominent like in a bomber jacket. While the jacket does have a collar, the lack of a visible zipper and the lighter color mean it does not match the description of a dark-colored jacket with a front zipper. This contrasts with the black jacket in Image A, which clearly has a zipper and collar. The styling in Image B is more rustic and vintage, differing from the modern urban style of Image A.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the pants worn by the figure blue in color and consistent with the appearance of denim jeans?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is wearing gray pants, not blue. These pants resemble cargo-style trousers or khakis, with a muted tone and visible stitching details. They do not exhibit the characteristic texture, fading, or indigo hue associated with denim jeans. In contrast, Image A shows the person wearing blue jeans, which are visibly denim in texture and color. Thus, the pants in Image B are not blue nor do they resemble denim jeans. The difference in fabric type and color is evident through visual inspection and common knowledge about clothing materials.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the figure standing upright with one hand visible near the side of the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is standing upright inside an open suitcase. Both hands are visible, but they are positioned at the sides of the body, not in a relaxed or neutral stance. One hand is slightly forward, while the other is near the hip. However, since both hands are visible and the posture is upright, the description 'one hand visible near the side' is partially accurate but misleading because both hands are visible. Nevertheless, if we interpret 'one hand visible' as at least one being visible and near the side, then this condition is met. Given the context of a stylized figurine, full anatomical detail may not be emphasized, but the visibility of at least one hand near the side is confirmed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Are both shoulder straps of the backpack visible and positioned over the shoulders?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack has two straps, both of which are clearly visible and positioned over the shoulders of the figure. The straps are symmetrical and extend from the backpack to each shoulder, forming a typical backpack configuration. This is consistent with standard backpack design and matches the visual representation in the image. Unlike Image A, where only one strap might be visible depending on angle, Image B provides a frontal view showing both straps. Therefore, both straps are visible and correctly positioned.",
    "answer": "Yes"
