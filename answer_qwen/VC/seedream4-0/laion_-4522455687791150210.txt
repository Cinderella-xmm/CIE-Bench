    "Question": "Q1: Is the lime green body of the saree adorned with small golden diamond-shaped butis evenly distributed across the fabric?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the saree appears to be made of a marble-like material, mimicking the texture and appearance of a real saree. However, upon close inspection, the surface of the 'lime green' portion does not display any visible golden diamond-shaped butis (small decorative motifs). Instead, the entire figure is sculpted in a monochromatic stone texture, suggesting that the patterns seen in the original image have been replaced or omitted in this artistic rendering. The lack of color variation and intricate detailing indicates that the design elements like butis are absent. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the statue's surface is uniformly textured without the fine embroidery or woven patterns typical of such sarees.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the pallu feature a blue and gold striped pattern with repeating elephant motifs in gold zari?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pallu (the end part of the saree) is depicted as part of the marble sculpture. While the original image shows a detailed blue and gold striped pattern with elephant motifs, in this edited version, the pallu lacks distinct colors and patterns. The sculpture’s surface is smooth and consistent in tone, lacking the vibrant blue and gold stripes and the intricate elephant designs seen in traditional sarees. The absence of color differentiation and embossed patterns suggests that these decorative elements were not preserved in the transformation into a statue form. Therefore, the detailed design of the pallu from the original image is not present here.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the blouse royal blue with golden embroidered detailing along the neckline and sleeve edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blouse area of the statue is rendered in a blue hue, matching the original color scheme. However, due to the nature of the sculpture, the surface lacks the fine details such as embroidery or golden threadwork. The texture appears smooth and uniform, without the visible golden detailing along the neckline or sleeves that would be expected in an actual embroidered blouse. The material of the statue (marble) does not support the kind of intricate textile work seen in the original image. Thus, while the color is correct, the decorative elements are absent.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a necklace with red and green stones positioned around the neck?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue wears a necklace that is visible around the neck. The necklace appears to have a central red gemstone, resembling a ruby, which matches the description in the original image. However, there is no visible green stone present; instead, the necklace seems to consist of a single red stone flanked by gold elements. The absence of green stones contradicts the original description. Based on visual analysis, only the red stone is clearly discernible, and no green stones are evident in the design.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Are there earrings matching the necklace visible in both ears?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue has earrings attached to both ears. They appear to be gold in color and have a dangling design, consistent with traditional Indian jewelry. However, they do not seem to match the necklace in terms of design or gemstone inclusion—specifically, there is no visible red or green stone in the earrings. The necklace features a prominent red stone, but the earrings lack similar colored stones. While the earrings are present and gold, their design does not fully match the necklace, indicating a mismatch in detail compared to the original image.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a golden bangle present on the right wrist?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right wrist of the statue is adorned with a golden bangle. It is clearly visible and matches the style of traditional Indian jewelry. The bangle is circular and shiny, consistent with gold material. This element is accurately represented in the sculpture, preserving the detail from the original image. Despite the transformation into a statue, the bangle remains intact and identifiable.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a bindi visible on the center of the forehead?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue’s forehead is smooth and unadorned. There is no visible mark or dot at the center of the forehead that would indicate a bindi. In contrast, the original image likely includes a bindi, which is a common accessory in traditional Indian attire. The absence of any such marking on the statue suggests that this cultural detail was either omitted during the artistic rendering or not included in the sculpture’s design. Therefore, based on visual evidence, the bindi is not present.",
    "answer": "No"
