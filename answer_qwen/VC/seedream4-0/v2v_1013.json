      "question": "Does the sparrow retain its black bib under the chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow is depicted with a visible dark patch under its chin, which corresponds to the typical 'bib' seen in house sparrows. This feature is consistent with the natural appearance of the species and is clearly rendered in the image. The coloration appears darker than the surrounding feathers, matching the expected black or dark gray bib. Comparing this to Image A, where the same feature is present, confirms that the black bib has been preserved in the edited version. The artistic style of Image B does not obscure this detail; instead, it maintains anatomical accuracy in this region.",

      "question": "Does the blue tit retain its vibrant blue and yellow coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue tit displays vivid blue on its head, wings, and tail, along with bright yellow on its chest and belly. These colors are characteristic of the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) and are accurately represented. The digital rendering enhances the vibrancy without distorting the natural palette. When compared to Image A, the coloration remains consistent—both images show the same striking contrast between blue and yellow. The editing process has preserved these key visual traits, even though the background and setting have changed.",

      "question": "Are the birds still facing each other in their respective postures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both birds are oriented toward one another, with their heads turned slightly to face each other. The sparrow is positioned on the left, looking right, while the blue tit is on the right, looking left. This mutual orientation mirrors their positioning in Image A, where they also face each other on a branch. Despite the change in environment—from a natural branch to a desk—the relative posture and direction of gaze remain consistent. This suggests that the interaction between the birds was intentionally preserved during editing, maintaining the sense of engagement between them.",

      "question": "Do both birds retain their distinct black eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both birds have clearly defined black eyes. The sparrow's eye is round and dark, set within a lighter facial area, which is typical for the species. Similarly, the blue tit’s eye is also black and prominent, contrasting with its white cheeks and blue crown. These features are consistent with real-world bird anatomy and are accurately portrayed in the digital illustration. Compared to Image A, the eye color and shape remain unchanged, indicating that this detail was preserved during the edit. Even in the stylized representation of Image B, the eyes are not altered or obscured.",

      "question": "Do both birds retain their visible feet gripping the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both birds have their feet clearly visible and positioned as if gripping a surface. The sparrow’s orange feet are shown clutching the edge of the desk, with individual toes and claws detailed. The blue tit’s gray feet are similarly visible, with toes wrapped around the desk surface. This contrasts with Image A, where the birds are perched on a branch with natural grip mechanics. In Image B, the feet are adapted to the new surface (a desk), but the action of gripping is maintained. The depiction shows realistic foot structure and positioning, suggesting that the artist preserved the functional aspect of the birds’ stance despite the environmental change.",
