      "question": "Is the central flower beneath the butterfly a pink coneflower with a prominent spiky central cone and drooping pink petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central flower clearly displays characteristics of a coneflower (Echinacea), identifiable by its large, spiky central cone composed of densely packed florets. The petals are elongated, soft pink in color, and curve downward, which is typical of coneflowers. This visual evidence aligns with botanical knowledge of Echinacea species, particularly Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower. The presence of a prominent central cone and drooping petals confirms this identification.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned directly above the central cone of the flower, with its body aligned vertically over it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the butterfly is indeed positioned directly above the central cone of the flower. Its body is oriented vertically, with its head pointing upward and legs resting on the cone. The alignment is precise, suggesting intentional composition to emphasize symmetry and balance. This positioning is consistent with how butterflies might naturally land on flowers, though the artistic style here enhances the aesthetic rather than strict realism.",

      "question": "Are there tall golden grasses and additional pink coneflowers visible in the background behind the main flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features tall, golden-hued grasses that sway gently, creating depth and texture in the meadow setting. Additionally, several other pink coneflowers are visible at varying distances behind the central flower, reinforcing the natural field environment. These elements are consistent with a prairie or meadow ecosystem where coneflowers and grasses coexist. The repetition of similar floral structures supports the idea of a dense population of these plants.",

      "question": "Is the sky a pale blue with soft white clouds and a warm golden light illuminating the meadow from below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is depicted as a pale blue with scattered, soft white clouds, contributing to a serene and tranquil atmosphere. A warm golden light appears to emanate from the lower part of the image, casting a glow across the meadow and highlighting the flowers and grasses. This lighting effect suggests either sunrise or sunset, which is common in landscape art to create mood and depth. The directionality of the light—coming from below—enhances the ethereal quality of the scene.",

      "question": "Are there small clusters of purple wildflowers and pink spiky blooms visible among the grasses in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, small clusters of purple wildflowers can be seen interspersed among the golden grasses. These appear as delicate, low-growing blooms, adding variety to the flora. Additionally, pink spiky blooms, possibly representing another type of flowering plant like blazing star (Liatris), are visible in the background. These details enrich the biodiversity of the scene and are consistent with natural meadow ecosystems that host multiple plant species.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central cone of the flower have a spiky, bristly texture made of densely packed dark-tipped florets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central cone of the flower in Image B exhibits a highly detailed texture, with numerous small, tightly packed structures resembling florets. These florets have dark tips, giving the cone a bristly appearance. This matches the botanical structure of coneflowers, where the central disk is composed of many tiny flowers (disc florets) that mature into seeds. The visual detail supports the conclusion that the cone is both spiky and densely packed, consistent with real-world coneflower anatomy.",

      "question": "Do the petals of the central flower curve downward and have a smooth, elongated shape with a soft pink hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The petals of the central flower in Image B are clearly elongated and exhibit a gentle downward curve, which is characteristic of coneflower species. Their surface appears smooth, without serrations or jagged edges, and they are uniformly colored in a soft pink shade. This description aligns with typical representations of Echinacea purpurea, where the ray florets (petals) droop gracefully from the central cone. The consistency in color and form reinforces the accuracy of this depiction.",
