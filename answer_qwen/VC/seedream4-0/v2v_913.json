      "question": "Does the cake retain its two distinct layers of dark chocolate sponge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is depicted in a stylized, animated format. Despite the artistic exaggeration and anthropomorphism (the cake has arms and legs), the internal structure of the cake remains consistent with the original visual cues. The cross-section clearly shows two distinct layers of dark chocolate sponge separated by a layer of chocolate filling. This matches typical representations of layered chocolate cakes. Even though the character design adds elements like limbs and facial features, the structural integrity of the cake’s layers is preserved for clarity and recognition. Based on common sense and visual analysis, the two-layered structure is maintained.",

      "question": "Is the top of the cake covered in a glossy, reflective chocolate glaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top surface of the cake is rendered with a shiny, smooth texture that reflects light, indicating a glossy finish. This visual characteristic is consistent with chocolate glaze, which typically has a high sheen due to its sugar and fat content. The reflections and highlights on the glaze suggest a liquid or semi-liquid consistency, reinforcing the idea of a freshly applied chocolate topping. Even in the animated style, this feature is emphasized to convey richness and indulgence, aligning with real-world expectations of a glazed chocolate cake.",

      "question": "Are there three visible streams of chocolate glaze dripping down the front face of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the front face of the cake shows multiple streams of chocolate glaze flowing downward. While the number may vary slightly due to artistic interpretation, three distinct drips are clearly visible in both panels—especially in the bottom panel where the cake is animated and more detailed. These drips are consistent with how melted chocolate behaves when it overflows from the top of a cake. The animation enhances these details to emphasize the 'chocolatey power,' but they remain visually accurate to the expected appearance of a glazed cake.",

      "question": "Do the cake layers exhibit a dark brown, moist, and porous sponge texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cake layers in Image B are illustrated with a dark brown color and a textured surface that suggests porosity, typical of baked sponge cake. Although the image is stylized, the texture is designed to mimic the crumb structure of a moist chocolate sponge. In both panels, the inner layers show small holes and irregularities consistent with sponge cake. The artist uses shading and detail to imply moisture and softness, even if not photorealistic. Given that chocolate sponge cakes are known for their dense yet airy texture, this representation aligns with realistic expectations.",

      "question": "Is the cake placed on a white circular plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both panels of Image B, the cake is positioned on a plain white plate that is circular in shape. This is consistent across the two scenes: in the first, the girl sits beside the cake on the plate, and in the second, the animated cake stands on the same plate. The plate serves as a neutral background that contrasts with the dark cake, emphasizing its presence. The round shape and clean white color are standard for serving desserts, especially in bakery settings as depicted in the background. There is no visual evidence suggesting any deviation from this setup.",

      "question": "Does the cake maintain its triangular cross-sectional shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cake in Image B retains the classic triangular slice shape throughout both panels. Even when anthropomorphized and given limbs, the overall geometry of the cake remains a wedge-shaped piece with straight edges and a pointed tip, consistent with a slice cut from a round cake. The cross-section reveals two horizontal layers, confirming the triangular profile. This shape is essential for identifying a cake slice, and the artist preserves it despite adding cartoonish elements, ensuring visual coherence with real-world expectations.",
