    "Question": "Q1: Are there two separate, cushioned backrest sections positioned side by side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a fantastical creature made of clouds with antler-like structures and no discernible seating or sofa features. There are no visible backrest sections, let alone two separate cushioned ones. The structure is organic and cloud-like, lacking any defined segmentation resembling a sofa's backrest. Based on visual analysis, this image does not contain any elements that resemble a traditional sofa or its components. Therefore, it cannot have two separate cushioned backrest sections.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are there two armrests, one on each side of the sofa, aligned with the seat cushions?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a cloud-based creature with four legs and antlers, but no armrests or any part resembling furniture. The form is entirely organic and whimsical, composed of swirling clouds and smoke. There are no structural elements that could be interpreted as armrests. In contrast, Image A shows a sofa with clearly defined armrests on both sides. However, since Image B lacks any such features, the answer must reflect the absence of armrests in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the sofa have four legs, one at each corner of the base?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a cloud creature with four leg-like formations at the bottom, which resemble feet or paws made of cloud material. These are positioned at the base and appear to support the body, similar to how legs support a sofa. However, these are not wooden or structural legs like those in a real sofa; they are part of the creature’s anatomy. While there are four supports, they are not 'legs' in the conventional furniture sense. Nevertheless, if interpreting 'legs' broadly as supporting structures at each corner, the creature has four such supports. But since the question refers to a 'sofa,' and this is not a sofa, the presence of four legs in a sofa context does not apply. Thus, despite the visual similarity in number, the object is not a sofa, so the answer is no.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the sofa symmetrically arranged along a vertical centerline, with identical features on the left and right sides?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a cloud creature that appears roughly symmetrical along a vertical axis. The antlers are mirrored, the eyes are placed symmetrically, and the overall shape suggests bilateral symmetry. However, due to the natural, flowing nature of clouds and smoke, minor asymmetries exist—especially in the smoke trails and cloud swirls. While the general form is balanced, perfect symmetry is not achieved. In contrast, Image A (the original sofa) is highly symmetrical, with matching armrests, cushions, and frame design. But since Image B is not a sofa and exhibits only approximate symmetry, the strict definition of 'symmetrically arranged' for a sofa does not hold.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the seat cushions positioned directly beneath the backrest cushions, forming a continuous seating surface?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains no seat cushions or backrest cushions. It is a cloud creature with no seating elements. There is no indication of a continuous seating surface or any arrangement resembling a sofa. The structure is entirely organic and non-functional as furniture. In contrast, Image A clearly shows seat cushions directly beneath backrest cushions, forming a continuous surface. But since Image B lacks any such components, the answer must be no.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there small black circular fasteners visible on the wooden frame, particularly near the armrest joints?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not contain any wooden frame or armrest joints. It is a cloud-based creature with no visible wood or mechanical fasteners. The entire structure is composed of soft, cloud-like material. In contrast, Image A shows a wooden frame with small black circular fasteners near the armrest joints, likely screws or bolts. However, since Image B lacks any such elements, the answer is no.",
    "answer": "No"
