      "question": "Is the balance beam made of wood with visible wear and chipped paint?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balance beam appears to be rendered in a stylized, artistic manner rather than photorealistic. The surface of the beam has a textured appearance that resembles wood grain, but it is not clearly detailed enough to confirm actual wear or chipped paint. Instead, the texture seems to be part of the artistic design, possibly representing chalk dust or stylized markings. In contrast, Image A shows a more realistic depiction where the beam has visible white chalk marks and signs of use, including slight discoloration and wear. However, in Image B, the focus is on aesthetic elements like brush strokes and stars, which abstract the details. Therefore, while the beam may resemble wood, there are no definitive visual cues indicating chipped paint or significant wear.",

      "question": "Does the gymnast maintain a handstand with her body arched backward and legs lifted vertically above her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast is depicted in a highly stylized form, with her body bent into a backbend position. Her hands are placed on the beam, supporting her weight, and her legs are raised high above her head, forming an arch. This pose is consistent with a handstand variation involving a backbend, commonly seen in artistic gymnastics. Although the figure is simplified and silhouetted in parts, the posture clearly shows the body arched backward with legs extended upward. Comparing this to Image A, the same pose is present, but with greater anatomical detail. In both images, the gymnast is performing a handstand-like maneuver with a pronounced arch. Thus, the description aligns with the visual evidence in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the leotard divided into silver upper body and blue lower body with a gradient transition and sparkles along the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast's leotard features a distinct color division: the upper torso and arms are silver, while the lower body is dark blue. There is a clear gradient effect transitioning between these colors along the spine, particularly noticeable near the waist and back. Additionally, small sparkling or glitter-like textures are visible along the spine, enhancing the visual appeal. This matches the description provided. While Image A also shows a similar color scheme and sparkle detail, Image B emphasizes these elements through artistic rendering, such as brushstroke effects and light reflections. The gradient and sparkles are intentional design choices in both images, but they are more pronounced in Image B due to its illustrative style.",

      "question": "Is the gymnast’s hair styled in a tight bun secured with a blue hair tie?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast's hair is shown in a silhouette form, with a defined bun at the back of her head. However, due to the black silhouette treatment, no specific color or detail of the hair tie can be discerned. The absence of visible color or texture makes it impossible to confirm whether the hair tie is blue. In contrast, Image A clearly shows a light blue hair tie securing the bun. Since Image B uses abstraction and simplification, details like hair tie color are omitted. Therefore, based solely on Image B, we cannot verify the color of the hair tie.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balance beam has a textured surface with streaks and smudges that resemble chalk marks, especially near the area under the gymnast’s hands. These markings are consistent with the typical appearance of chalk residue left by gymnasts during routines. Although the image is stylized, the presence of these white streaks suggests chalk usage. In Image A, the chalk marks are more explicitly visible and realistic. However, even in the stylized version (Image B), the artistic interpretation includes elements resembling chalk, likely to convey authenticity. Thus, despite the abstraction, the visual cues support the presence of chalk marks.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast's face is depicted in profile, and the ear is partially visible. However, due to the silhouette treatment and lack of fine detail, no earring is clearly visible. The ear is rendered in solid black, without any indication of jewelry. In Image A, a small stud earring is indeed visible on the left ear, but this detail is absent in Image B because of the artistic simplification. Therefore, based on the visual information in Image B alone, there is no evidence of an earring.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast's head is angled to the side, showing a profile view. Her gaze appears to be directed downward, consistent with focusing on the beam during a balance maneuver. Although the face is rendered as a silhouette, the orientation of the head and the direction of the jawline suggest a downward look. This aligns with standard gymnastic technique, where athletes maintain focus on their point of contact for stability. In Image A, the same facial orientation is present, with the eyes clearly looking down. Even though Image B lacks detailed facial features, the overall posture supports the conclusion that the face is turned sideways and the gaze is downward.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast's hands are positioned on the top surface of the balance beam, with fingers spread and palms pressing down. This placement is consistent with a handstand posture, where the hands provide full support. The angle of the arms and the alignment of the body indicate that the hands are bearing the weight. Although the hands are stylized and lack fine anatomical detail, their positioning relative to the beam confirms they are flat and engaged in supporting the body. In Image A, the same hand placement is evident, reinforcing the accuracy of this observation. Therefore, despite the artistic style, the visual cues in Image B support the conclusion that the hands are flat and supporting the gymnast.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast's hands are depicted in a dark blue tone, matching the rest of the leotard, with no visible white grips. Gymnastic grips are typically worn to improve grip and prevent slipping, and they are often white or colored. However, in this stylized image, the hands are rendered without additional accessories, suggesting that grips are not present. In Image A, white grips are clearly visible on the hands, but they are omitted in Image B due to the artistic abstraction. Since the question pertains only to Image B, and no grips are shown, the answer must reflect the absence of this detail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a faint, blurred depiction of tiered seating, suggesting an audience. The lighting is soft and ambient, with no distinct overhead stadium lights visible. While the setting implies an indoor arena, the details are minimal and abstracted. The audience is suggested through subtle color gradients and shapes, but not clearly defined. In contrast, Image A shows a detailed background with visible stadium lights and a crowd. However, Image B uses artistic license, reducing background complexity. Thus, although there is a suggestion of an audience and lighting, the specifics like 'overhead stadium lights' are not clearly present in Image B.",
