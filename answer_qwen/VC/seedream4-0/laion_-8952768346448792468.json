      "question": "Does the edited image retain the platinum blonde hair with visible waves and braided sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject has long, flowing blonde hair that is styled with soft waves and includes braided sections near the crown of the head. The hair color is a light, silvery blonde consistent with 'platinum blonde,' and the texture shows distinct wave patterns and braiding details. These visual cues align with the description in the original image (Image A), where the same hairstyle was present. The artistic rendering in Image B maintains these features despite being stylized as a painting, preserving both the color and structure of the hair. Therefore, based on visual analysis and knowledge of how such hairstyles are typically represented in historical or dramatic art, the hair characteristics are accurately retained.",

      "question": "Are the facial features, including the jawline and eye shape, accurately preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's face is rendered with a high degree of detail. The jawline appears sharp and defined, consistent with the original subject’s facial structure. The eyes are almond-shaped, with a downward gaze, matching the expression and proportions seen in Image A. Despite the transition from a photograph to a painted style, the artist has preserved the essential facial landmarks—such as the bridge of the nose, cheekbones, and overall symmetry—indicating a faithful representation. This preservation is typical in portrait-style paintings where likeness is prioritized, especially when depicting well-known figures. Thus, based on visual comparison and understanding of portraiture techniques, the facial features are accurately preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject depicted in a standing position with a slightly bowed head and hands clasped in front of the waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is clearly standing upright, facing forward, with the head tilted slightly downward, suggesting a bowed posture. The hands are positioned together in front of the waist, clasped gently, which matches the pose seen in Image A. This stance conveys a sense of solemnity or contemplation, commonly used in formal portraits or dramatic scenes. The consistency in posture between the two images indicates that the edit has maintained this specific body language. Given that such poses are often deliberately composed for narrative or symbolic effect, their retention suggests intentional fidelity to the original scene.",

      "question": "Is a dagger present in the subject’s hands, held vertically with both hands clasping it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands are clasped in front of the waist, but there is no visible dagger. Instead, the hands appear to be resting naturally without any object between them. In contrast, Image A shows the subject holding a dagger vertically with both hands. The absence of the dagger in Image B is notable, as it represents a significant change in the composition. This omission may reflect an artistic choice to emphasize elegance or remove a symbolic element of power or threat. Based on visual evidence alone, the dagger is not present in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the subject positioned centrally between two parallel lines of figures extending into the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject stands at the center of the composition, flanked by two symmetrical lines of figures dressed in period attire. These figures extend into the background along a cobblestone courtyard, forming a clear corridor-like arrangement. This layout mirrors the spatial composition in Image A, where soldiers were arranged in parallel lines behind the subject. The use of perspective and symmetry in both images reinforces the central positioning of the subject. Even though the setting has changed from a sandy battlefield to a palace courtyard, the structural alignment remains consistent. Therefore, the subject is indeed positioned centrally between two parallel lines of figures.",
