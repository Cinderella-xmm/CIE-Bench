      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the multi-tiered, stepped gable structure of the church, with at least three distinct roof levels stacked vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure is no longer a wooden church but a tall, crystalline tower composed of ice-like facets and glowing runes. The architectural form has been transformed into a fantastical, vertical spire that rises through swirling clouds. While it does have multiple tiers or levels, these are not defined by traditional stepped gables or wooden roofing as seen in typical stave churches. Instead, the structure is made of sharp, geometric crystal formations stacked vertically. Therefore, the original multi-tiered, stepped gable design—characteristic of Norwegian stave churches—is not preserved. The visual cues suggest a complete transformation from a wooden ecclesiastical building to a magical, ethereal monument.",

      "question": "Are there visible carved wooden patterns along the eaves and gables of the church, even if overlaid with glowing runes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the material of the structure has changed entirely from wood to translucent, icy crystals. There are no visible wooden surfaces or carvings. Instead, the surface features glowing blue runes and spiral patterns embedded within the crystal, which resemble magical inscriptions rather than traditional Norse woodcarving. These runes are not superimposed on wood but appear to be intrinsic to the crystalline material itself. Since the original carved wooden patterns are absent due to the replacement of the material, they cannot be said to be present—even if obscured. The absence of any discernible wood grain or relief carving confirms this.",

      "question": "Is the cross-shaped finial still present at the very top of the central spire, even if partially obscured by glowing celestial orbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the spire in Image B features a bright, radiant orb emitting light, resembling a celestial body or magical energy source. This orb is positioned at the apex, but there is no visible cross-shaped finial beneath or behind it. In contrast, traditional stave churches feature a cross atop the spire. Here, the structure is purely fantastical, and the top is dominated by the glowing sphere and angular crystal points, with no trace of a cross. Even if obscured, the presence of a cross would require some structural indication of its shape, which is absent. Thus, the cross-shaped finial is not present.",

      "question": "Are there horn-like or antler-shaped projections extending from the corners of the roof sections, especially at the top tiers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the stave church displays characteristic horn-like or antler-shaped wooden projections at the corners of its gables, a hallmark of Viking-era architecture. However, in Image B, these features are completely absent. The structure is made of smooth, faceted crystal with no organic or animalistic extensions. Instead, the edges are sharp and geometric, lacking any curved or branching forms resembling horns or antlers. The transformation into a magical tower eliminates all such architectural embellishments. Therefore, the horn-like projections are not present.",

      "question": "Is there a stone-paved pathway leading directly from the foreground to the main entrance of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a winding stone path is indeed visible in the foreground, curving gently toward the base of the crystalline tower. It appears to originate from the bottom edge of the image and leads up to the foot of the structure. Although the 'entrance' is not clearly defined (as the tower lacks a door), the path continues directly toward the central base, suggesting access. The stones are arranged in a meandering pattern, consistent with a natural, hand-laid pathway. Given the continuity and direction of the path, it can be reasonably concluded that a stone-paved pathway leads toward the structure’s base.",

      "question": "Is there a clearly defined arched doorway located at the center of the front facade, accessible via a short flight of steps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure does not have a visible arched doorway. Instead, the base of the tower is surrounded by swirling clouds and mist, obscuring any potential entryway. No arches, doors, or steps are discernible. Unlike the original church, which had a clear central entrance with stairs, this magical edifice lacks any conventional architectural access points. The glowing runes and cloud formations dominate the lower portion, making it impossible to identify an arched doorway or steps. Therefore, the feature is absent.",

      "question": "Are there evergreen trees with snow on their branches and clusters of pink or purple flowering shrubs in the immediate foreground around the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground includes several coniferous trees with snow-covered branches, particularly on the left side and near the base of the tower. These trees resemble pine or fir and are consistent with a winter landscape. Additionally, patches of pink and purple flowering shrubs are visible around the base of the structure and along the path. These floral elements are present despite the snowy setting, indicating a blend of seasonal contrasts. The combination of snow-laden evergreens and blooming shrubs matches the description in the question.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a range of snow-capped mountains, similar to those in Image A, stretching across the horizon. Between the foreground structure and the mountains lies a calm, reflective body of water—likely a lake or river—that mirrors the sky and surrounding terrain. This geographical layout is consistent with the original scene, preserving the spatial relationship between the church (now transformed) and the natural landscape. The presence of both snow-covered peaks and an intervening water body confirms the accuracy of the description.",
