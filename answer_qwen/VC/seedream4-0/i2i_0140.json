      "question": "Does the quilt pattern retain its distinct pink, green, and white geometric and floral motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt patterns on both beds are rendered in a watercolor style, which softens the colors and edges. However, despite the artistic transformation, the core design elements—geometric shapes and floral motifs—are still recognizable. The dominant colors of pink, green, and white remain consistent with the original, even though they appear more blended and less sharply defined due to the watercolor effect. This suggests that while the visual texture has changed, the fundamental pattern and color scheme have been preserved. World knowledge about watercolor art indicates that such styles often diffuse colors but maintain underlying composition, supporting the conclusion that the motifs are still present.",

      "question": "Are the two beds still placed parallel, with the nightstand positioned centrally between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two beds are visually aligned side by side, maintaining their parallel orientation as seen in typical bedroom layouts. The nightstand is situated directly between them, centered in the space, consistent with standard furniture placement for symmetry and accessibility. Even though the image has a painterly effect, the spatial relationships are preserved: the beds are equidistant from the nightstand, and their alignment remains unchanged. This reflects common interior design principles where twin beds are placed symmetrically with a shared nightstand. No distortion in positioning is evident, so the arrangement remains intact.",

      "question": "Do the two framed wall art pieces remain above the respective beds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two framed artworks are visible on the wall, each positioned above one of the beds. Although the image has a watercolor aesthetic that slightly blurs the edges and details, the frames are clearly distinguishable and placed in the same relative positions as in the original. The artwork content, depicting figures in motion (possibly dancers), is faintly visible and matches the original. Based on world knowledge about room layout and decoration, it is standard to place artwork above beds for visual balance. Since both frames are present and correctly oriented above each bed, their placement has been retained.",

      "question": "Does the left bed retain the magenta decorative pillow and the right bed retain the teal decorative pillow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left bed features a decorative pillow with a magenta base and a circular pattern, while the right bed has a teal pillow with a similar design. These pillows are consistent with the original in both color and position. Although the watercolor effect softens the hues and adds a translucent quality, the distinction between the two colors remains clear enough to identify them as magenta and teal. Additionally, the placement of these accent pillows on the outer sides of each bed's arrangement aligns with typical decor practices. Therefore, despite the artistic rendering, the pillows are still present and identifiable.",

      "question": "Is there still a small white nightstand between the beds with a vase containing a pink flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small white nightstand is visible between the two beds. It maintains its central position and appears to have a vase with a pink flower on top. The watercolor style makes the details softer, but the shape of the nightstand and the presence of a vase with a single pink bloom are still discernible. This object is consistent with common bedroom furnishings, where a nightstand serves as a functional centerpiece between twin beds. The flower adds a decorative touch, reinforcing the idea of intentional styling. Given the continuity of form and function, the nightstand and its contents are preserved.",
