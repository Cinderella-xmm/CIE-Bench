      "question": "Are the two garage doors positioned side by side on the lower front portion of the cabin, directly beneath the large upper window section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two garage doors are clearly visible on the lower front portion of the cabin. They are placed adjacent to each other and appear to be directly beneath the upper window section, which is composed of multiple panes and framed with wooden beams. The layout matches a typical symmetrical design for a dual-car garage. The positioning is consistent with standard architectural practices where garage doors are centered under large upper windows or gable sections. This alignment suggests intentional design symmetry and functional use.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large, multi-pane window section with exposed wooden beams located directly above the two garage doors, spanning most of the front width of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper portion of the cabin features a large, multi-pane window structure that spans nearly the full width of the front façade. This window section includes exposed wooden beams forming a framework, resembling a traditional log cabin's gable end. The beams are arranged in a triangular pattern, supporting the roofline and providing structural integrity while also serving as an aesthetic feature. The presence of this window directly above the garage doors aligns with common architectural designs for log cabins, especially those incorporating both functionality and visual appeal.",

      "question": "Is there a small rectangular window cut into the log wall on the left side of the cabin, near the front corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the left side of the cabin, near the front corner, there is indeed a small rectangular opening in the log wall. It appears to be a window, though it is partially obscured by shadows and surrounding foliage. Its shape and placement are consistent with a small window typically found in log cabins for ventilation or light. The logs around it show natural curvature and texture, reinforcing its integration into the structure. Based on visual cues and architectural norms, this is identifiable as a window.",

      "question": "Is there a doorway located immediately to the right of the small rectangular window on the left side of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small rectangular window on the left side of the cabin is followed by a dark vertical opening just to its right. This opening has the proportions and depth typical of a doorway, and it appears to lead into the interior of the cabin. The space between the window and the doorway is narrow, suggesting they are closely positioned. Given the architectural style and layout, this configuration is plausible for access points in a log cabin. Therefore, based on visual evidence and common design patterns, a doorway is present immediately to the right of the window.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a continuous concrete foundation base running beneath the log walls of the cabin, visible along the lower perimeter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower portion of the cabin shows a solid, light-colored base that runs continuously along the bottom of the log walls. This base appears to be made of concrete or a similar material and provides a stable foundation. It is visible all around the perimeter of the structure, particularly noticeable at the front and sides. Such a foundation is common in log cabins to prevent moisture damage and ensure structural stability. The uniformity and color contrast with the logs support the conclusion that it is a continuous concrete foundation.",

      "question": "Is the cabin oriented such that its front façade is angled slightly toward the right side of the image, with the left side receding into the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin's front façade is not perfectly perpendicular to the viewer but instead appears to be angled slightly toward the right. This is evident from the perspective of the roofline and the relative positions of the left and right sides. The left side of the cabin seems to recede into the background, indicating a three-quarter view rather than a direct frontal shot. This angle gives depth to the image and emphasizes the cabin’s three-dimensional form. Such orientation is typical in photographic composition to enhance visual interest and spatial perception.",
