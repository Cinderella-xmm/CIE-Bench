      "question": "Is the U.S. $20 bill with its distinctive green color, \"20\" numeral, and architectural design visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual representation is a monochrome line drawing or blueprint-style rendering of the wallet and banknotes. While the shape and layout of the notes suggest the presence of a U.S. $20 bill—especially due to the recognizable outline of the architectural design (such as the White House) and the placement of the '20' numeral—the actual colors are not preserved. The image uses grayscale, so the distinctive green hue of the U.S. $20 bill is absent. However, the structural details like the numeral '20' and the architectural motif are still discernible in the line art. Based on world knowledge, the U.S. $20 bill features a green background with a prominent '20' and an image of the White House. In this stylized version, these elements are abstracted but still traceable. Therefore, while the visual cues are present in form, they lack color and full fidelity.",

      "question": "Is the Qatari Riyal note with its pink-orange hue, Arabic script, and serial number \"103 01\" present and recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a schematic or technical drawing style, where all elements are rendered in grayscale. The Qatari Riyal note, identifiable in Image A by its pink-orange tone and Arabic script, appears here only as a line-drawn outline. The specific hue is missing due to the monochromatic nature of the image. However, the general shape and positioning of the note suggest it is included. The serial number '103 01' may be faintly indicated in the line art, but without color or high contrast, it is not clearly legible. World knowledge confirms that Qatari Riyal notes often feature Arabic text and distinct serial numbers. In this edited version, the symbolic representation exists, but the full recognition of key identifying features such as color and readable script is compromised. Thus, while the note's presence is implied, its distinctiveness is reduced.",

      "question": "Is the Indian Rupee 50 note with the lion capital symbol and yellow-brown color clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Indian Rupee 50 note in Image A is characterized by a yellow-brown color and the emblem of the Lion Capital of Ashoka. In Image B, the same note is represented in a line-art format, lacking color. The outline of the note is present, and the position of the lion capital symbol can be inferred from the design patterns in the drawing. However, because the image is grayscale and lacks texture or color detail, the yellow-brown hue is absent, and the lion capital is only suggested by shape rather than being clearly defined. Based on world knowledge, the lion capital is a key identifier of Indian currency. In this stylized depiction, the symbolic representation is present but not clearly visible in terms of detail or color. Therefore, the note is present in form but not fully recognizable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the U.S. $1 bill is identifiable by the portrait of George Washington and the text 'ONE DOLLAR'. In Image B, the wallet contains multiple banknote outlines, and one of them matches the size and orientation of a U.S. $1 bill. However, due to the monochrome line drawing style, the portrait and textual details are not visible. The image shows only the silhouette and basic structure, not the fine details required to confirm the presence of George Washington or the 'ONE DOLLAR' text. World knowledge tells us that the $1 bill has a distinctive portrait and text layout, but in this edited version, those features are absent. Thus, while the space for the $1 bill is occupied, the critical identifying elements are not present.",

      "question": "Are all four banknotes (U.S. $20, Qatari Riyal, Indian Rupee 50, U.S. $1) present together in the same visual space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wallet contains several banknote outlines arranged in a fanned-out manner. Based on their relative sizes, shapes, and positions, it is reasonable to infer that four distinct notes are depicted—one matching each of the described currencies. The layout mirrors the arrangement in Image A, suggesting the inclusion of all four. Although the details are abstracted into line art, the spatial configuration indicates that all four notes occupy the same visual space within the wallet. World knowledge supports that a typical wallet holds multiple currencies, and the diagrammatic representation maintains this concept. Even though individual features are lost, the overall composition implies coexistence in the same frame.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a monochrome technical illustration, meaning all colors have been removed and replaced with grayscale lines and shading. The original dominant colors—green for the U.S. dollar bills, pink-orange for the Qatari Riyal, and yellow-brown for the Indian Rupee—are entirely absent. Instead, the image relies on outlines and structural details to convey information. This is consistent with schematic or blueprint representations, which prioritize form over color. World knowledge confirms that currency colors are key identifiers, but in this edited version, they are sacrificed for stylistic clarity. Therefore, the original colors are not preserved.",
