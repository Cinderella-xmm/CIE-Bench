    "Question": "Q1: Are there two female figures present in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, two distinct female figures are clearly visible. Both are depicted in traditional attire, standing side by side and facing forward. Their facial features, postures, and clothing are detailed and separate, confirming the presence of two individuals. The mosaic style does not obscure their forms; rather, it enhances the definition of each figure through tile patterns. Based on visual cues such as symmetry, positioning, and individualized features (e.g., different hand placements and slight variations in facial expression), it is evident that two female figures are present.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the two figures positioned symmetrically relative to the central axis of the image?",
    "explanation": "The composition of Image B shows both figures placed nearly equidistant from the vertical centerline of the image. Their postures, body orientations, and the alignment of their heads suggest a balanced arrangement. The background elements, such as the Taj Mahal and decorative motifs, are also mirrored or aligned along the central axis, reinforcing the symmetry. While minor differences exist in their facial expressions and hand positions, the overall layout maintains a symmetrical balance. This symmetry is common in religious or artistic mosaics to convey harmony and reverence, further supporting the conclusion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a large central dome visible at the end of the pathway?",
    "explanation": "Yes, a prominent dome structure is visible in the background, centered behind the two figures. This dome is consistent with the architectural style of the Taj Mahal, which features a large central dome flanked by smaller domes and minarets. In Image B, despite the mosaic rendering, the dome's shape, size, and position at the end of the pathway are clearly discernible. The use of golden tiles and geometric precision in the mosaic enhances the visibility of this central feature, making it unmistakable as a dominant architectural element.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there an arched stone entrance framing the view of the central structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is framed by an arched structure that appears to be part of a larger gateway or pavilion. This arch is constructed using mosaic tiles and has intricate detailing typical of Islamic architecture. It frames the view of the central dome (the Taj Mahal) and creates a sense of depth and perspective. While the arch is stylized due to the mosaic technique, its form and function as a framing device are clearly preserved. This aligns with real-world architectural designs where arched entrances often lead to significant structures like the Taj Mahal.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is there a straight water channel running from the foreground to the central structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although the ground is rendered in mosaic form, a linear pathway can be observed leading directly toward the central dome. This pathway is flanked by symmetrical landscaping and appears to represent a water channel, consistent with the actual layout of the Taj Mahal complex, where a reflecting pool runs from the main gate to the mausoleum. The mosaic interpretation uses color and pattern to suggest water—such as blue and reflective tiles—indicating the presence of a water feature. Given the known design of the Taj Mahal grounds, this visual cue strongly supports the inference that a straight water channel is depicted.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the sarees retain a dominant red and gold color scheme?",
    "explanation": "The sarees worn by both figures in Image B are composed primarily of red and gold mosaic tiles. The red forms the base fabric, while gold accents highlight the borders, floral patterns, and embroidery. This color combination is consistent with traditional Indian bridal or ceremonial attire and matches the original image’s aesthetic. Even though the mosaic style breaks down colors into small tiles, the dominance of red and gold remains clear. The choice of these colors is culturally significant, symbolizing prosperity and celebration in Indian traditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are gold jewelry pieces, including a forehead ornament (maang tikka) and earrings, visible on both figures?",
    "explanation": "Both figures in Image B display gold jewelry. The forehead ornament (maang tikka) is clearly visible on each woman, represented by a small, ornate piece centered on the forehead, crafted from gold-colored tiles. Additionally, dangling earrings are present on both figures, made from similar golden mosaic elements. These accessories are consistent with traditional Indian bridal wear and are rendered with sufficient detail in the mosaic to confirm their presence. The use of gold in jewelry reflects cultural norms and adds to the richness of the depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Do both figures have long, dark hair?",
    "explanation": "Yes, both figures in Image B have long, dark hair. The hair is depicted using dark-colored mosaic tiles that flow down past the shoulders, forming waves and curls. The texture and volume suggest length and fullness, typical of traditional representations of Indian women in art. The contrast between the dark hair and lighter skin tones, along with the way the hair drapes over the shoulders, confirms that both individuals possess long, dark hair. This aligns with both cultural norms and the visual consistency seen in the original image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
