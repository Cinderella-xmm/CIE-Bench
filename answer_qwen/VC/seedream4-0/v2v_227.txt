    "Question": "Q1: Is the motorcycle red in color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is clearly depicted with a bright red body. The color is consistent across all visible surfaces of the bike, including the fuel tank, fairings, and side panels. This visual cue, combined with common knowledge that red is a standard color for sport motorcycles in both real life and cartoon representations, supports the conclusion that the motorcycle is red. There are no indications of shading or lighting effects that would suggest a different base color.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the truck blue in color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is illustrated with a distinct blue color on its body, including the cab and bed. The blue is uniform and matches typical cartoon-style vehicle coloring. While some vehicles may have faded or rusted areas, the overall depiction here is clearly blue. This aligns with common representations of vintage trucks in stylized art, where colors are simplified and saturated for visual clarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the rider wearing a black helmet?",
    "explanation": "The rider in Image B is shown wearing a full-face helmet that is uniformly black. The helmet covers the entire head and has no visible markings, logos, or other colors. In cartoon illustrations, helmets are often simplified, but the solid black coloration is consistent and unambiguous. Based on this visual evidence and general understanding of motorcycle safety gear, it is clear the helmet is black.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the rider wearing a black leather jacket?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rider is dressed in a dark-colored jacket that appears to be made of leather due to its smooth texture and sheen, typical of cartoon depictions of leather. The jacket is black, covering the upper body and arms, which is consistent with standard motorcycle riding attire. While the image is stylized, the design and shading suggest a leather material rather than fabric or synthetic alternatives. Therefore, based on visual cues and common sense regarding motorcyclist clothing, the jacket is black and likely leather.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the motorcycle have a transparent windscreen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle features a small, upright windshield positioned in front of the rider. It is rendered in a translucent gray tone with light reflections, indicating transparency. This is consistent with how cartoon artists depict windshields—using a semi-transparent appearance to suggest glass or plastic. Real-world sport bikes commonly have such windshields to deflect wind, and this representation aligns with that expectation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the truck have round headlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck’s headlights are circular in shape, clearly depicted as two round bulbs set into the front grille. Although stylized, the round form is unmistakable. In real-life vehicles, especially older models like the one represented here (resembling a 1970s pickup), round headlights were common. The cartoon version preserves this characteristic, making it easy to identify them as round.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the rider leaning forward over the handlebars?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rider's posture shows their torso angled downward toward the handlebars, with arms extended and elbows slightly bent. This position is typical of aggressive riding stances seen on sport motorcycles, especially when accelerating or cornering. Even though the image is cartoonish, the pose clearly indicates forward lean, consistent with dynamic riding behavior. This contrasts with a relaxed upright posture, confirming the rider is leaning forward.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are the motorcycle and truck positioned side by side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the motorcycle and the truck are placed horizontally next to each other on the same level, with no significant overlap or separation. They are aligned along a shared axis, suggesting they are traveling parallel to one another. The background includes a red oval platform beneath both vehicles, reinforcing their coexistence in the same space. This arrangement visually confirms they are side by side, even though the scene is stylized and lacks motion blur or depth cues.",
    "answer": "Yes"
