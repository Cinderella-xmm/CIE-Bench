      "question": "Is the bust oriented in a side profile facing to the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bust is clearly shown in a side profile view. The face is turned to the right, with the left side of the head and shoulder visible from the viewer's perspective. This orientation is consistent with a traditional sculptural presentation where the subject faces to the right. Based on visual cues such as the positioning of the facial features, hair, and drapery, the bust is indeed facing right. This conclusion aligns with common artistic conventions for classical busts, which often depict figures in profile to emphasize facial features and symmetry.",

      "question": "Is there an inscribed plaque on the base with the word \"APOLLO\" visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the bust has a rectangular plaque affixed to it. The word 'APOLLO' is clearly inscribed on this plaque, along with smaller text beneath it that appears to be a model or manufacturer identifier (e.g., 'A-0478'). This is consistent with the labeling practices seen in decorative or collectible sculptures, where the name of the figure is displayed for identification. The presence of the word 'APOLLO' is unambiguous in the image and matches the label seen in Image A, confirming continuity in naming despite stylistic differences.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the neck, shoulders, and chest consistent with the original sculptural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bust maintains anatomical proportions typical of classical sculpture, particularly in the neck, shoulders, and chest area. The neck is slender and well-defined, connecting naturally to the head, while the shoulders are broad and balanced, reflecting idealized human anatomy. The chest shows subtle musculature and curvature consistent with classical representations of male figures like Apollo. Comparing to Image A, the underlying structure remains unchanged—though Image B adds mechanical elements (gears, tubing), these do not distort the fundamental proportions. Therefore, despite the steampunk modifications, the core sculptural proportions remain faithful to the original form.",

      "question": "Does the drapery extend from the left shoulder across the chest in a diagonal fold?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drapery is intricately designed with a flowing, layered appearance. It originates from the left shoulder and crosses diagonally over the chest toward the right side, forming a prominent fold. This diagonal arrangement is characteristic of classical drapery styles seen in ancient Greek and Roman sculptures, where fabric is draped to suggest movement and elegance. Even with added mechanical embellishments, the drapery’s path remains consistent with this classical motif. In comparison to Image A, the same diagonal flow is preserved, indicating that the design intent was maintained even after transformation into a steampunk aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the base a cylindrical pedestal with a flat top and rounded bottom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base is not a simple cylindrical pedestal. Instead, it is a more elaborate structure featuring a circular platform with gear-like detailing and rivets, supporting a central column that connects to the bust. The top of the base is flat, but the bottom is not rounded—it has a flared, decorative edge with mechanical motifs. Unlike the plain cylindrical base in Image A, this one incorporates steampunk elements such as gears and clockwork components. Thus, while it has a flat top, the overall shape deviates significantly from a standard cylindrical form with a rounded bottom.",

      "question": "Is there a small circular medallion or button-like ornament on the left shoulder of the drapery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drapery on the left shoulder features a distinct circular element that resembles a medallion or button. It is metallic and integrated into the fabric fold, appearing as a decorative fastening. This detail is consistent with both classical and steampunk design aesthetics—classical statues often include symbolic ornaments, and here it is stylized with mechanical flair. In contrast, Image A shows a similar but simpler round ornament on the same location, suggesting continuity in design language. However, in Image B, the ornament is more pronounced and detailed, possibly incorporating gear-like patterns, reinforcing its role as a functional-looking adornment.",
