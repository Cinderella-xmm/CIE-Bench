      "question": "Does the edited image show the octopus with exactly eight tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus is depicted in a stylized, illustrative manner typical of vintage travel posters. Observing the tentacles, we can count eight distinct appendages extending from the head. Each tentacle appears to be clearly defined and separate from the others, consistent with the biological anatomy of an octopus, which naturally has eight arms. The artistic style emphasizes clarity and symmetry, making it easy to verify that there are exactly eight tentacles. This aligns with real-world knowledge: octopuses have eight arms (tentacles), and this depiction adheres to that fact even within a stylized context.",

      "question": "Are there two distinct, large eyes visible on the octopus’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus's head features two prominent, round eyes positioned symmetrically on either side of its mantle. These eyes are clearly visible, well-defined, and colored with yellow irises and black pupils, standing out against the darker tones of the head. In real octopuses, eyes are large and located on the sides of the head, which matches this illustration. The artist has emphasized these features for visual impact, ensuring they are unmistakable. There is no ambiguity in their presence or positioning.",

      "question": "Are suction cups visible along the underside of at least some of the octopus’s tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the tentacles in Image B, small circular patterns are visible along the undersides of several arms. These are stylized representations of suction cups, which are characteristic of octopus anatomy. While not rendered with photorealistic detail, the repeated circular motifs are clearly intended to depict suction cups, especially given the anatomical accuracy expected in such a themed illustration. In real octopuses, each arm is lined with rows of suction cups used for movement and gripping. The artist has included these details to maintain biological plausibility within the cartoonish art style.",

      "question": "Is the octopus positioned on or adjacent to the beach, with part of its body in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus is shown emerging from the ocean onto a sandy beach. Its lower body and several tentacles extend into the shallow water near the shoreline, while other parts rest on the sand. The waves gently lap around its base, indicating partial submersion. This placement is consistent with the setting—a tropical beach scene—where the creature appears to be interacting with both land and sea. The composition suggests a natural transition between aquatic and terrestrial environments, reinforcing the idea that the octopus is partially in the water.",

      "question": "Is the octopus clearly the largest and most prominent figure in the image, facing directly toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The octopus dominates the central portion of Image B, occupying the majority of the vertical space and drawing immediate attention due to its size and color contrast against the sky and sea. It faces forward, with its head and eyes oriented directly toward the viewer, creating a sense of engagement. No other object or character rivals its scale or visual prominence. Even the text above it is designed to complement rather than compete with the octopus. This compositional choice emphasizes the creature as the focal point, consistent with the purpose of a promotional poster where the main subject must stand out.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground clearly shows a wide expanse of light-colored sand extending from the bottom edge of the image toward the waterline. The boundary between the sand and the ocean is marked by gentle waves and foam, indicating the shoreline. Tropical plants and flowers are scattered across the sand, enhancing the beach atmosphere. This detailed rendering of a beachfront confirms the presence of a visible sandy shore meeting the ocean, consistent with the 'Tentacle Shores' theme. The perspective and depth cues further support this interpretation.",
