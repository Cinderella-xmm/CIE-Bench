    "Question": "Q1: Is the subject wearing bright red lipstick?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s lips are clearly visible and coated in a vivid, saturated red color. This shade is consistent with what is commonly described as 'bright red lipstick.' The color stands out against her skin tone and is evenly applied, suggesting intentional styling.

    "Question": "Q2: Are the sunglasses black with a rectangular frame and reflective lenses?",
    "explanation": "The sunglasses in Image B have a distinct black frame with sharp, angular edges, characteristic of a rectangular shape. The lenses reflect light and surroundings, indicating they are reflective, which is typical for sunglasses designed for both function and style. These visual traits—black color, rectangular geometry, and mirror-like surface—are consistent with the description provided. This analysis is supported by general knowledge about sunglass design, where such frames are popular in fashion contexts.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the subject’s hair pulled back tightly, revealing her forehead and ears?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair appears neatly styled and gathered at the back of her head, forming a sleek, tight look. Her forehead is fully visible, and both ears are exposed without any hair covering them. This suggests that her hair is pulled back tightly, likely into a bun or ponytail. This hairstyle is common in fashion photography to emphasize facial features and accessories like sunglasses. The absence of loose strands further supports the conclusion that the hair is securely fastened.",

    "explanation": "In Image B, the neckline of the subject’s top is visible beneath the open collar of her maroon coat. The fabric appears soft and has a pale pink hue, consistent with a light pink turtleneck. The texture and fit suggest a close-fitting garment typical of turtlenecks.

The fabric below the coat appears to be a solid, dark gray color with a smooth texture, consistent with a skirt. The silhouette suggests a fitted style, typical of a skirt rather than pants. While only part of the garment is visible, the color and cut align with the description of a dark gray skirt. This conclusion is based on visual cues and standard clothing identification in fashion imagery.",

    "Question": "Q7: Is there a strong shadow cast on the right side of the subject’s face and body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to come from the left side of the frame, casting shadows on the right side of the subject’s face and body. The right cheek, jawline, and shoulder show defined dark areas, indicating a strong directional light source. This creates contrast between the illuminated and shaded regions, emphasizing depth and dimension. Such shadows are typical in outdoor or studio lighting setups with high-contrast illumination. The presence of these shadows is visually clear and consistent with the principles of light and shadow in photography.",
