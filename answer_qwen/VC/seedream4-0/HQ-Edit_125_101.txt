    "Question": "Q1: Is the dancer depicted in an arabesque leap with one leg extended behind and arms forming a diagonal line?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is shown inside a snow globe, captured mid-leap. The pose features one leg extended high behind the body, which is characteristic of an arabesque position in ballet. Additionally, the arms are positioned in a diagonal line—one raised above the head and the other extended to the side—creating a graceful, elongated silhouette typical of classical ballet. This alignment supports the identification of the pose as an arabesque leap. The visual cues such as the elevated leg and diagonal arm placement align with standard definitions of this ballet move.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the Eiffel Tower retain its characteristic iron lattice structure and three-tiered design with a spire at the top?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is depicted within the snow globe as a miniature model. Despite its small scale, it clearly shows the iconic iron lattice framework, the three distinct tiers, and a pointed spire at the top. These structural elements are consistent with the real-world design of the Eiffel Tower. The level of detail, including the arched base and vertical supports, confirms that the representation preserves the tower’s architectural characteristics, even in a stylized or decorative form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are both feet of the dancer wearing pointe shoes with visible ribbons and box-like structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is wearing ballet shoes that resemble pointe shoes, particularly on the foot that is lifted. However, upon closer inspection, only one foot (the supporting foot) appears to be in a pointe shoe with visible ribbons and a defined box-like toe structure. The other foot, though raised, does not clearly show the same detailed construction. In fact, the positioning and lighting suggest that the shoe may be more generalized or simplified due to the artistic rendering within the snow globe. Therefore, while one foot appears to have proper pointe shoe details, the other lacks clear evidence of ribbons and the full box structure.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the dancer’s head turned to face the Eiffel Tower, indicating forward gaze toward it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's head is tilted slightly upward and angled to the side, but her gaze is directed toward the left side of the frame, which corresponds to the direction of the Eiffel Tower within the snow globe. Given the composition, the dancer’s orientation and facial profile suggest she is looking toward the tower. This alignment, combined with the spatial arrangement of the figures, indicates a deliberate visual connection between the dancer and the landmark. Her head turn and eye direction support the interpretation that she is gazing forward toward the Eiffel Tower.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the dancer wearing a leotard that is predominantly turquoise in color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is wearing a bronze-colored outfit that matches the metallic finish of the entire figurine inside the snow globe. The material appears to be cast metal, likely bronze or brass, giving it a warm, golden-brown hue rather than turquoise. There is no indication of a turquoise leotard; instead, the color is consistent throughout the figure and reflects the artistic style of the collectible item. Therefore, based on the visual evidence, the dancer is not wearing a turquoise leotard.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the dancer positioned in the foreground, clearly in front of the Eiffel Tower?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is placed within the snow globe, standing on a snowy base that is in front of the miniature Eiffel Tower and other Parisian landmarks. From the viewer’s perspective, the dancer is physically closer to the camera than the Eiffel Tower, which is situated further back in the scene. This spatial arrangement places the dancer in the foreground relative to the tower, creating depth within the enclosed environment of the snow globe. Thus, despite being part of the same scene, the dancer is clearly positioned in front of the Eiffel Tower.",
    "answer": "Yes"
