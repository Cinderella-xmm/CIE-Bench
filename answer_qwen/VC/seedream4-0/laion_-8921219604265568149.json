      "question": "Is the clock face present on the upper section of the left bell tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left bell tower is visible and appears to have a small circular feature near its upper section. Upon close inspection, this feature resembles a clock face with discernible markings and hands, consistent with typical clock designs. This is supported by world knowledge that many historic churches in Latin America, such as the one depicted (likely the Cathedral of Cartagena), often include clocks on their bell towers for public timekeeping. The presence of a clock face is further reinforced by the architectural style and historical context of such buildings. Comparing this to Image A, the same clock face is clearly visible, confirming its presence in both images. Therefore, based on visual evidence and contextual understanding, the clock face is indeed present.",

      "question": "Are there two bells visible in the arches of the right bell tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right bell tower features two distinct arched openings. Within these arches, two bells are clearly visible—one in the upper arch and another in the lower arch. The design is consistent with traditional church bell towers where multiple bells are hung at different levels for chimes or calls to worship. This configuration is common in colonial-era cathedrals. In Image A, the same arrangement is observed, confirming the presence of two bells. Thus, the visual cues in both images support the conclusion that two bells are present in the right bell tower.",

      "question": "Is there a circular stained-glass window with a floral or star-like pattern centered above the main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, above the central entrance of the cathedral façade, there is a circular window with an intricate design. The pattern within the window appears to be symmetrical and radiating, resembling a floral or star-like motif—common in Baroque-style stained glass used in religious architecture. This is consistent with the architectural style of the building, which suggests a colonial Spanish influence. In Image A, the same window is visible and matches this description. Therefore, based on visual analysis and architectural knowledge, the circular stained-glass window with a decorative pattern is present.",

      "question": "Is there a cross positioned at the highest point of the central roofline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central peak of the cathedral's roofline is topped with a small cross. This is a standard feature in Christian church architecture, symbolizing faith and serving as a religious emblem. The cross is clearly visible against the sky, even though it is stylized and modest in size. In Image A, the same cross is present, confirming its existence. Given the religious function of the building and architectural norms, the presence of a cross at the apex is expected and confirmed by visual evidence.",

      "question": "Are there three doors on the façade: one large central door and two smaller side doors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral façade displays three distinct entrances: a large central doorway flanked by two smaller wooden doors on either side. This tripartite layout is typical of Baroque ecclesiastical architecture, where symmetry and hierarchy are emphasized. The central door is significantly wider and more prominent, suggesting it is the main entrance, while the side doors are narrower and likely secondary. In Image A, the same configuration is evident. Thus, based on both visual cues and architectural conventions, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Is the façade symmetrically divided by vertical columns and pilasters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral’s façade exhibits a clear symmetrical design. Vertical elements such as columns and pilasters are evenly spaced along the front, dividing the structure into balanced sections. These elements frame the central entrance and flank the windows and niches, creating a harmonious and formal appearance typical of Baroque architecture. The symmetry is mirrored on both sides of the central axis. In Image A, the same symmetry is present, reinforcing the conclusion. Therefore, the façade is indeed symmetrically divided by vertical architectural features.",

      "question": "Does the left bell tower have a pinkish dome with a cross on top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left bell tower has a dome-like structure at its summit. However, the color of the dome appears to be light beige or off-white, not pinkish. The top of the dome features a small cross, which is consistent with religious symbolism. While some historical churches may have colored domes, the visual evidence here does not support a pinkish hue. In Image A, the dome also appears to be light-colored without any noticeable pink tone. Therefore, despite the presence of a cross, the dome is not pinkish.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, to the right of the cathedral, a tall building is visible with multiple floors. It features several balconies, each equipped with ornate wrought-iron railings, characteristic of colonial urban architecture in regions like Cartagena, Colombia. The building’s façade includes windows and decorative elements consistent with historical residential or commercial structures. In Image A, the same building is present, confirming the details. Thus, based on visual observation and contextual knowledge of such architectural styles, the building described exists.",
