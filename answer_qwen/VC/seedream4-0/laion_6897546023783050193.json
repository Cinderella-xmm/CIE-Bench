      "question": "Are both arms extended horizontally to the sides, forming a symmetrical T-shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's arms are indeed extended outward, but they are not perfectly horizontal or symmetrically aligned. The right arm (from the viewer’s perspective) is slightly higher and more angled upward than the left, which appears more level. Additionally, the positioning of the arms does not form a perfect T-shape due to this asymmetry in elevation. In traditional depictions of Christ with outstretched arms, symmetry is often emphasized, but here the artistic style introduces variation. The posture is more dynamic and less rigidly symmetrical, especially when compared to the typical frontal, balanced pose seen in statues like Christ the Redeemer. Therefore, while both arms are extended, the overall shape is not a symmetrical T.",

      "question": "Is the head tilted upward and slightly toward the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure’s head is clearly tilted upward, indicating an expression of transcendence or spiritual elevation, common in religious art. However, the tilt is not toward the left side of the frame; instead, it is slightly toward the right. This can be determined by observing the alignment of the face relative to the shoulders and the direction of the gaze. The chin is raised, and the eyes are closed, suggesting a serene or meditative state. The orientation of the facial features—particularly the nose and mouth—shows that the head is turned subtly to the right, not the left. This contrasts with some Western sculptural traditions where such figures may face forward with minimal head tilt, but here the Japanese woodblock-style rendering emphasizes expressive gesture.",

      "question": "Does the figure have a beard and hair covered by a hooded garment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure does not have a visible beard. Instead, the face is smooth, with soft contours and no indication of facial hair. The hair is depicted as being covered by a hooded garment, consistent with traditional representations of religious figures in certain artistic styles. The hood drapes over the head and neck, blending into the robe. While this aligns with the idea of a hooded garment, the absence of a beard contradicts the typical depiction of Jesus Christ in Western Christian iconography. However, in this particular artwork, which appears inspired by Japanese ukiyo-e aesthetics, stylistic choices prioritize elegance and symbolism over literal realism. Thus, the figure lacks a beard despite the hooded attire.",

      "question": "Are both hands open with palms facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands are shown open, with fingers spread apart in a gesture of offering or blessing. The palms are clearly facing forward, which is consistent with many religious depictions of Christ or divine figures extending their hands in a welcoming or protective manner. This is reinforced by the way light and shadow are rendered on the hands—there is no indication of the back of the hand being visible, confirming the forward-facing palm orientation. The artistic style uses clean lines and clear outlines to emphasize the gesture, making the intention of the pose unmistakable. Even though the figure is stylized, the hand position remains faithful to symbolic representation.",

      "question": "Does the robe cover the entire body from shoulders to the base of the statue, with vertical folds running down the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe does extend from the shoulders down to the lower part of the figure, covering the full body. However, the folds are not strictly vertical; instead, they follow a flowing, undulating pattern influenced by the movement of the fabric and the dynamic posture of the figure. The robe has both vertical and diagonal elements, particularly in the sleeves and lower portion, where the fabric appears to ripple as if caught in wind. This is characteristic of Japanese woodblock prints, where motion and fluidity are emphasized through stylized lines. While there are vertical folds, they are not uniformly arranged across the front. Therefore, although the robe covers the body fully, the fold pattern is not purely vertical.",

      "question": "Is the statue shown in a frontal pose, viewed from a low angle looking upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is presented in a frontal pose, meaning the face and torso are oriented directly toward the viewer. However, the perspective is not from a low angle looking upward. Instead, the viewpoint is at eye level or slightly elevated, allowing for a full view of the figure against the sky and waves. There is no foreshortening or upward tilt that would suggest a low-angle shot. This differs significantly from Image A, which shows a statue from below, emphasizing its height and grandeur. In contrast, Image B uses a more balanced composition typical of traditional Japanese prints, where the subject is centered and proportionally scaled within the scene. Therefore, while the pose is frontal, the viewing angle is not low.",
