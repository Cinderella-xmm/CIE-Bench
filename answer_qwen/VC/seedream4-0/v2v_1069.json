      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object inside the snow globe is a small decorative fan with three blades, not four. The fan is stylized and cartoonish, with a cute face on the center hub. This is clearly different from the original ceiling fan in Image A, which has four metallic blades. Based on visual inspection, the number of blades has been reduced from four to three. Therefore, the original four blades are not retained.",

      "question": "Is the central hub structure of the ceiling fan still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central hub of the fan is present but significantly altered in design. It features a round, cartoon-like face with eyes and a smile, which is not part of the original ceiling fan’s design. While the functional role of the hub as the center point for the blades is preserved, its structure and appearance are transformed into a playful, decorative element. In contrast, Image A shows a traditional metallic hub with no facial features. Thus, while a hub exists, it is not the same in form or function as the original.",

      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the metallic texture and color scheme of the ceiling fan?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a fan made of plastic with a light blue and white color scheme, featuring soft, rounded edges and a non-metallic finish. The original ceiling fan in Image A has a brushed metallic texture and a silver-gray color scheme. The materials and finishes are entirely different—plastic vs. metal, pastel colors vs. industrial gray. Therefore, the metallic texture and color scheme are not preserved.",

      "question": "Are the blades arranged symmetrically around the central hub in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three blades of the fan are evenly spaced around the central hub, forming a balanced and symmetrical arrangement. Although there are fewer blades than in the original, their placement appears intentional and geometrically even, maintaining rotational symmetry. In Image A, the four blades are also symmetrically arranged. The symmetry principle is preserved in both images, though the number of blades differs. Thus, the edited image does maintain symmetry in blade arrangement.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the connection points between the blades and the central hub are not clearly visible. The design is simplified and stylized, with the blades appearing to be seamlessly attached to the hub without distinct mechanical joints or screws. In contrast, Image A shows visible connection points—small metallic rods and bolts connecting each blade to the hub. These details are absent in the edited image due to its cartoonish and minimalist aesthetic. Therefore, the connection points are not visible.",
