      "question": "Is the player depicted wearing a red shirt with black shorts in all frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player is shown across four distinct frames, each depicting a different stage of a tennis swing. In every frame, the character is consistently dressed in a red short-sleeved shirt and black shorts. The red shirt features a small dark logo on the chest area, and the black shorts have a white stripe along the side, which remains consistent throughout. This visual consistency suggests intentional design to maintain the player's appearance across the sequence. Based on common sense and visual analysis, clothing details are preserved across frames in illustrated sequences to ensure continuity and recognition. Therefore, the attire matches the description in all frames.",

      "question": "Does each frame show the player dynamically engaged with the tennis racket and ball, mimicking a natural hitting motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a comic-style sequence showing the progression of a tennis stroke. The first frame shows the player in a ready stance, holding the racket back. The second frame captures the forward swing as the racket moves toward the ball. The third frame shows the racket making contact with the ball, and the fourth frame depicts the follow-through motion. Each frame illustrates a logical step in a forehand stroke, demonstrating dynamic engagement between the player, racket, and ball. The body posture, arm extension, and racket trajectory align with real-world biomechanics of a tennis swing. Thus, the sequence effectively mimics a natural hitting motion.",

      "question": "Are the racket and ball consistently positioned to indicate a realistic hitting action in every frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the sequence, the positioning of the racket and ball evolves logically across the frames. In the first frame, the ball is not yet visible, indicating it has not reached the hitting zone. In the second frame, the racket is extended forward, suggesting the approach phase. In the third frame, the ball is shown near the racket strings, indicating contact. In the fourth frame, the ball appears slightly ahead of the racket, implying post-impact movement. This progression reflects realistic physics—specifically, the timing and spatial relationship between the racket and ball during a forehand shot. While slight artistic liberties may exist (e.g., exaggerated angles), the overall positioning supports a believable hitting action. Hence, the racket and ball are consistently placed to suggest realism.",

      "question": "Does the player retain his short dark hair in all frames of the sequence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Across all four frames in Image B, the player’s hairstyle is consistently depicted as short and dark. The hair is styled neatly, with a slightly tousled look typical of athletic movement, but the length and color remain unchanged. In animation or illustrated sequences, maintaining consistent physical traits like hairstyle helps preserve character identity. There is no variation in hair style, length, or color from one frame to the next, even during dynamic movements. Therefore, based on visual continuity and standard illustration practices, the player retains his short dark hair throughout.",

      "question": "Does the yellow tennis ball appear consistently across all frames, maintaining its bright color and position relevance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The yellow tennis ball is present in only two of the four frames: the third and fourth. In the third frame, it is positioned near the racket strings, indicating impact. In the fourth frame, it is shown moving away from the racket, consistent with post-contact dynamics. The ball maintains its bright yellow color in both appearances, which is standard for tennis balls. However, it does not appear in the first two frames, which is reasonable because the ball would not be visible before it enters the player’s hitting zone. Its absence in earlier frames does not violate realism—it simply reflects the timing of the action. Therefore, while the ball is not present in all frames, when it is, it maintains its color and relevant position. Thus, the statement 'consistently across all frames' is false due to its absence in the initial two frames.",
