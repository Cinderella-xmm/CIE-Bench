    "Question": "Q1: Does the clock tower retain its hexagonal shape?",
    "explanation": "To determine if the clock tower retains its hexagonal shape, I analyze the structural geometry of the tower in Image B. The tower has six visible sides with symmetrical angles and evenly spaced architectural elements such as windows, flags, and decorative moldings. This consistent repetition of six sides indicates a hexagonal cross-section. Even with the addition of snow on the roof and balcony, the underlying structure maintains this symmetry. In real-world architecture, hexagonal towers are common in clock towers and often feature repeating patterns that align with six-fold symmetry. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and architectural reasoning, the tower retains its hexagonal shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the clock face still present with Roman numerals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central part of the tower features a circular clock face. Upon close inspection, the numbers around the clock are clearly marked using Roman numerals (I through XII), which is a traditional design for clock faces. The presence of these numerals is consistent with historical and aesthetic conventions seen in many clock towers. There is no distortion or replacement of the numerals, and they remain legible despite the snowy conditions. Thus, the clock face with Roman numerals is still present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the tower still have a balcony with balusters below the clock face?",
    "explanation": "Observing the area directly beneath the clock face in Image B, there is a visible railing structure composed of vertical balusters connected by a horizontal top rail. This is characteristic of a balcony or viewing platform commonly found on clock towers. The balusters are evenly spaced and match the architectural style of the tower. Despite being partially covered in snow, the structure remains intact and identifiable. This feature is consistent with typical clock tower designs where a balcony provides access to the clock mechanism or serves as an ornamental element. Therefore, the balcony with balusters is still present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the tower retain its pointed roof structure?",
    "explanation": "The roof of the tower in Image B appears to be covered in snow, but the underlying shape is still discernible. The roof has a multi-tiered, conical form that tapers to a point at the top, which is consistent with a pointed roof structure. Snow accumulation does not alter the fundamental shape; it only adds a layer over the original design. In architectural terms, such roofs are often designed to shed water or snow efficiently, and their pointed nature is preserved even when covered. Thus, despite the snow, the tower retains its pointed roof structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the tower retain its green and yellow color scheme, excluding the flags?",
    "explanation": "The main body of the tower in Image B displays a combination of green and yellow colors. The walls and structural elements such as columns, arches, and trim are painted in alternating green and yellow hues, which matches the original color scheme observed in Image A. Although snow covers parts of the tower, the exposed sections clearly show the same green and yellow pattern. The flags have changed from green and yellow to icy blue, but the question specifies to exclude the flags. Therefore, the primary color scheme of the tower remains unchanged.",
    "answer": "Yes"
