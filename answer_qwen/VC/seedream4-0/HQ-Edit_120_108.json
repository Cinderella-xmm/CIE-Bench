      "question": "Is the book physically present and open on the wooden desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large, open book is clearly visible on the surface of the desk. The pages are spread wide, showing detailed illustrations that resemble mechanical diagrams or blueprints. The book's physical presence is confirmed by its realistic texture, shadowing beneath it, and interaction with the light from the lamp. Its placement on the desk is stable and central, indicating it is indeed physically present and open. This conclusion is supported by visual cues such as depth, lighting, and perspective, which align with real-world expectations of an open book resting on a flat surface.",

      "question": "Is the ornate brass desk lamp positioned on the left side of the desk, with its arm extended toward the book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brass desk lamp in Image B is located on the left side of the desk, consistent with typical desk lamp placement for right-handed users. Its articulated arm extends diagonally across the desk toward the center, where the open book lies. The lamp’s design includes multiple gears and mechanical details, reinforcing its steampunk aesthetic. The positioning allows the light to illuminate the book directly, which is a functional arrangement. Visual cues like shadows and the direction of the light beam confirm the arm is extended toward the book.",

      "question": "Is the desk made of wood with visible grain texture and located beneath all objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The desk in Image B appears to be made of wood, with a rich brown tone and visible grain patterns that suggest a natural material. The surface shows slight variations in color and texture, characteristic of aged wood. Additionally, all objects — the lamp, books, and open book — are placed directly on this surface, confirming that the desk supports them. The edges of the desk are also reinforced with leather-like trim and rivets, adding to its vintage appearance but not contradicting the wooden base. Thus, based on visual evidence and common knowledge about furniture construction, the desk is wooden and serves as the foundation for all items.",

      "question": "Are there two stacked books on the right side of the desk and one small closed book on the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the right side of the desk in Image B, there are two books stacked vertically. The top book has a dark blue cover, while the bottom one has a reddish-brown spine, both appearing aged and worn. On the left side, near the base of the lamp, there is a single small closed book with a light brown cover, lying flat. These observations match the description exactly. The relative positions and sizes of the books are consistent with typical desk arrangements, and their physical attributes (such as wear and binding) support their authenticity within the scene.",

      "question": "Does the lamp emit a focused beam of light that falls directly onto the open book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lamp in Image B emits a bright, conical beam of light that originates from its shade and illuminates the open book directly. The light creates a clear spotlight effect, casting a warm glow on the book's pages while leaving surrounding areas in relative shadow. This focused illumination suggests a directional light source, typical of desk lamps designed to provide targeted reading light. The angle and intensity of the beam align with the position of the lamp and the book, confirming that the light is directed precisely at the book.",

      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the scene warm browns, golds, and deep blues, consistent with a vintage leather-and-brass aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall color palette of Image B features warm browns in the wooden desk and book covers, golden hues in the brass lamp and its mechanical gears, and deep blues in the background wall and some book bindings. These colors collectively evoke a vintage, possibly steampunk-inspired atmosphere. The use of rich, earthy tones combined with metallic accents is characteristic of a classic leather-and-brass aesthetic often seen in antique or retro-styled interiors. The lighting enhances these colors, creating depth and warmth, further supporting the intended theme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall behind the desk in Image B appears to be dark in tone, leaning toward a deep teal or charcoal hue, rather than pure black. It has a slightly textured surface, possibly resembling fabric or painted plaster with subtle imperfections. Additionally, floral patterns are visible in the upper-right corner, suggesting wallpaper or decorative paint. While the exact shade may vary slightly due to lighting, the overall impression is consistent with a dark teal background. The texture adds depth and complements the vintage feel of the scene. Therefore, based on visual analysis and context, the wall can be described as dark teal with a textured surface.",
