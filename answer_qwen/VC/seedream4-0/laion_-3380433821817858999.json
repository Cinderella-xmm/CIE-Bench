      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown with a distinct hairstyle that is spiky and colored in a light blue shade. This visual detail is consistent across multiple panels of the image, particularly in Step 1 and Step 3, where the character's head is clearly visible. The light blue coloration is a known trait associated with Vegeta when he transforms into his Super Saiyan Blue form in the Dragon Ball series. Based on this visual evidence and world knowledge of the character design from the anime, it is clear that the character has light blue spiky hair.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is depicted wearing a full-body suit that is predominantly blue. Over the torso, there is a white armored chest plate with distinct yellow panels on the sides, which are characteristic of Vegeta’s battle armor in the Dragon Ball franchise. This design is consistent across all three steps shown in the image, especially visible in Step 1 and Step 3. The combination of blue bodysuit, white chest armor, and yellow side accents matches the iconic outfit worn by Vegeta during his Super Saiyan Blue transformations. Therefore, based on visual analysis and recognition of the character's attire from the series, the answer is affirmative.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s gloves and boots are clearly visible in multiple panels. The gloves are white and extend up to the forearms, while the boots are also white and cover the lower legs. Both the gloves and boots have yellow tips at the fingertips and toes, which is a signature design element of Vegeta’s gear in the Dragon Ball series. This detail is consistently present in Step 1 and Step 3, where the hands and feet are shown in profile or frontal view. The yellow tips are a distinctive feature that aligns with the character’s canonical appearance, confirming the accuracy of this description.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, particularly in Step 1 and Step 3, the character’s facial expression is clearly visible. The mouth is wide open, suggesting a shout or battle cry, which is typical of Vegeta during combat scenes. His eyes are narrowed and focused, conveying intensity and aggression. These features are consistent with Vegeta’s portrayal in the Dragon Ball series, especially during high-energy moments like power jumps or attacks. The facial expression aligns with the character’s known demeanor—competitive, fierce, and determined—making it evident that the character displays an aggressive stance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Step 1 shows the character in a dynamic mid-air pose, leaping forward with arms extended forward and legs bent backward, indicating motion and power. In Step 3, the character is depicted in a seated position on a stand, but still with knees tucked tightly and body angled as if in mid-air, reflecting the final stage of the jump technique. While not all poses show arms raised, the overall sequence emphasizes a powerful leap with limbs positioned for maximum propulsion. The term 'dynamic mid-air pose' is best captured in Step 1, where the character is fully airborne with limbs engaged in a forceful attack stance. Thus, the depiction aligns with the description of a dynamic mid-air movement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B exhibits multiple defining traits of Vegeta from the Dragon Ball series: light blue spiky hair (Super Saiyan Blue form), a blue bodysuit with a white chest plate and yellow side panels, white gloves and boots with yellow tips, and an aggressive facial expression. These features are iconic and uniquely associated with Vegeta, especially in his transformed states. Additionally, the instructional nature of the image, titled 'Master the Power Jump,' references a move commonly associated with Vegeta’s fighting style. The visual consistency across all panels and alignment with established character design confirm that the character is unmistakably Vegeta.",
