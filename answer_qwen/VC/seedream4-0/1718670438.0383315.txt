    "Question": "Q1: Does the robot retain its dome-shaped head with three evenly spaced circular porthole eyes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's head is clearly visible under a glass dome. The head maintains a distinct dome shape consistent with steampunk design aesthetics. Three circular portholes are positioned on the front of the head—two on the sides and one in the center—arranged symmetrically. These portholes resemble eyes and are evenly spaced, matching the description. This configuration aligns with common visual motifs in steampunk robotics where mechanical 'eyes' are used to anthropomorphize machines. The spacing and placement are symmetrical and balanced, supporting the conclusion that they are evenly distributed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the transparent chest panel still present, clearly displaying the internal gear system?",
    "explanation": "The chest area of the robot in Image B features a rectangular, transparent panel that allows visibility into the internal mechanics. Through this panel, multiple interlocking gears, cogs, and mechanical components are clearly visible, forming a complex internal system typical of steampunk designs. The transparency of the panel is maintained, and it appears intact without any obstructions. This detail is consistent with the aesthetic of showcasing inner workings as a hallmark of steampunk engineering. Therefore, the presence and clarity of the transparent chest panel are confirmed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do both arms retain their segmented, piston-style joint construction?",
    "explanation": "Observing the arms in Image B, both exhibit a multi-segmented structure with cylindrical joints that resemble pistons or hydraulic actuators. Each arm has distinct segments connected by articulated joints, giving them a mechanical, industrial appearance. The design includes visible piping and riveted connections, reinforcing the piston-like functionality. The symmetry between the left and right arms confirms that both follow the same construction pattern. This style is characteristic of steampunk machinery, where exposed mechanical elements simulate movement and power transmission.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are both feet equipped with exactly five claw-like toes each?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot’s feet are visible beneath the glass dome. Each foot has a cluster of protruding, claw-like structures resembling toes. Upon close inspection, both feet display five such appendages—four arranged radially around a central one—giving them a pentagonal footprint. The claws appear metallic and slightly worn, consistent with the overall aged aesthetic. The symmetry between the two feet suggests intentional design. Counting confirms five toes per foot, matching the described feature.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there five distinct spires and antennae on top of the robot’s head, including one central and four lateral ones?",
    "explanation": "At the top of the robot’s dome-shaped head in Image B, several vertical protrusions are visible. There is one central spire directly above the head, flanked by two pairs of smaller spires—one on each side—totaling five. These structures resemble antennae or steam vents, common in steampunk designs for either functional or decorative purposes. Their arrangement (one central, two on each side) supports the description of five distinct elements. The visual clarity allows for accurate counting and identification.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are multiple interlocking gears of different sizes visible through the transparent chest panel?",
    "explanation": "Through the transparent chest panel in Image B, a detailed internal mechanism is visible. Multiple gears of varying sizes can be seen—some large and central, others smaller and surrounding them—interlocked in a way that suggests mechanical motion. These gears are intricately designed with teeth and shafts, consistent with clockwork or steam-powered systems. The complexity and variety in size indicate a functional gear train, which is a defining element of steampunk engineering. The visibility is unobstructed, confirming their presence.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the robot maintain its original oxidized bronze and copper color scheme with visible wear and aging effects?",
    "explanation": "The robot in Image B exhibits a rich palette dominated by shades of bronze and copper, with darkened areas suggesting oxidation and patina. Surface textures include scratches, dents, and rust-like discoloration, especially around joints and edges, indicating artificial aging. These effects are consistent with the steampunk genre’s emphasis on vintage industrial aesthetics. The lighting enhances the metallic sheen while highlighting imperfections, reinforcing the impression of age and use. This matches the expected visual characteristics of an oxidized, weathered metal construct.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are the rivets and mechanical fasteners visible along the joints and edges of the robot’s body?",
    "explanation": "Throughout the robot’s body in Image B, particularly at joint connections such as shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees, small circular or elongated fasteners are clearly visible. These appear to be rivets or bolts, commonly used in mechanical construction to secure plates and segments. They are strategically placed along seams and structural boundaries, contributing to the industrial look. The level of detail in the rendering allows these elements to be discernible, even from a distance. Their presence is consistent with real-world mechanical assembly practices and reinforces the authenticity of the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
