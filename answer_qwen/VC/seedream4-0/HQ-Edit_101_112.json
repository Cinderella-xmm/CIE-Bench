      "question": "Is the elderly woman seated with her hands folded together in her lap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly woman is depicted sitting on a wooden bench. Her hands are clearly visible and positioned together in her lap, resting gently with fingers interlaced or overlapping. This posture is consistent with traditional depictions of seated individuals in Japanese art, where calmness and composure are emphasized. The hands are not clenched or raised but are held in a relaxed, folded manner, which aligns with the cultural context of respectful stillness. Therefore, based on visual evidence and cultural norms represented in such artwork, it is clear that her hands are folded together in her lap.",

      "question": "Is there a woven basket located on the bench to the right of the seated woman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a woven basket is clearly visible on the bench. It is positioned to the right side of the woman from the viewer's perspective (her left). The basket has a natural brown color and a traditional wicker design, typical of Japanese craftsmanship. Its placement next to the woman suggests it may be part of her belongings, possibly used for carrying items during a stroll in the garden. There is no ambiguity in its presence or location, as it is distinctly drawn and placed on the bench.",

      "question": "Is the woman sitting on a wooden bench positioned on a paved path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden bench is situated directly on what appears to be a flat, stone-paved surface. The ground beneath the bench is uniform in texture and color, consistent with a paved path commonly found in traditional Japanese gardens. The edges of the paving stones are visible, and the surface extends beyond the bench, suggesting it is part of a walkway. This is typical of garden settings where benches are placed along paths for rest and contemplation. Therefore, the bench is indeed positioned on a paved path.",

      "question": "Are the woman's feet wearing dark blue slip-on shoes over white socks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s footwear consists of traditional Japanese sandals known as zori, which are black with white straps and appear to be worn over white socks. These are not slip-on shoes but rather open-toed sandals. While the socks are white, the shoes are not dark blue; they are black. Slip-on shoes would typically cover the entire foot without straps, which is not the case here. Thus, the description of 'dark blue slip-on shoes' does not match the visual details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, numerous pink cherry blossom petals are scattered across the ground in front of and around the base of the bench. These petals are characteristic of springtime in Japan, especially during cherry blossom season. Their presence enhances the seasonal atmosphere and complements the surrounding cherry trees. The distribution of petals is dense enough to be clearly noticeable, confirming their visibility.",

      "question": "Is there a calm water canal running behind the bench, bordered by stone walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a narrow water canal is visible directly behind the bench. The water appears still and reflective, indicating calmness. On both sides of the canal, there are stone retaining walls made of stacked rocks, which are typical in traditional Japanese garden designs to manage waterways. The canal extends into the background, leading toward the bridge. This layout is consistent with formal garden aesthetics and confirms the presence of a canal bordered by stone walls.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a distinct arched wooden bridge spans the canal in the background. The bridge has a classic Japanese design, featuring a gentle curve and railings along its sides. It connects the two banks of the canal and is positioned centrally in the composition, serving as a focal point. This type of bridge is common in traditional Japanese gardens and adds to the serene, picturesque quality of the scene.",

      "question": "Are cherry blossom branches extending over the top of the image, partially framing the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, cherry blossom branches are visible at the top of the frame, extending from both sides and arching over the scene. These branches are adorned with pink blossoms and contribute to a natural framing effect, drawing the viewer’s eye inward. The positioning of the branches above the woman and the bench creates a canopy-like structure, reinforcing the theme of spring and nature. This is a common compositional technique in Japanese art to emphasize harmony with nature.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s head is oriented straight ahead, with her gaze directed forward toward the viewer. Her facial features are centered in the composition, and there is no indication of a tilt or turn to either side. Her eyes are open and appear to be focused straight ahead, consistent with a frontal pose often used in portraiture to convey dignity and presence. This direct orientation supports the interpretation that she is facing forward.",
