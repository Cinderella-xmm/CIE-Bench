      "question": "Is the bear's body shaped with a distinct hump over the shoulders and a broad, muscular back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear is depicted in a classroom setting on the left side, wearing glasses and a vest, resembling an anthropomorphic character. While this bear is stylized and cartoonish, it still retains some anatomical features of a real bear. However, due to its anthropomorphic design—standing upright like a human—the natural hump over the shoulders typical of grizzly or brown bears is not clearly visible. The bear’s back appears broad but lacks the pronounced shoulder hump seen in wild bears. This is likely due to artistic simplification for character design. In contrast, Image A shows a realistic bear in a natural environment, where the hump over the shoulders is clearly defined, consistent with biological accuracy. Thus, in Image B, the bear does not exhibit a distinct hump as seen in real-life bears.",

      "question": "Does the salmon have a clearly defined forked tail fin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right panel shows a salmon leaping out of the water. The tail fin is visible and appears to be divided into two lobes, which is characteristic of a forked tail fin commonly found in salmon species such as Chinook or sockeye. The visual detail supports this structure, with clear separation between the upper and lower lobes of the tail. This aligns with biological knowledge of salmon anatomy, where the forked tail aids in swift swimming through water. No comparison to Image A is necessary here since the focus is on the salmon in Image B, and the tail shape is clearly depicted.",

      "question": "Is the bear’s fur rendered with visible texture and layered shading, showing wetness and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bear in Image B is an anthropomorphic character standing in a classroom. Its fur is rendered with a soft, cartoon-like style, lacking the fine details such as individual strands, layered shading, or signs of wetness that would suggest realism. There is no indication of moisture or depth in the fur texture; instead, it has a smooth, uniform appearance typical of animated characters. In contrast, Image A shows a highly detailed, photorealistic bear with fur that exhibits texture, layering, and wetness from splashing water. Therefore, the fur in Image B does not display the same level of detail or realism.",

      "question": "Is the salmon colored with a blue-green back and a silvery-white belly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the salmon shown leaping from the water has a dorsal side that appears bluish-green, transitioning to a lighter, silvery-white underside. This coloration is consistent with the natural pigmentation of adult Pacific salmon, which typically have dark backs and light bellies to provide camouflage in their aquatic environment. The visual cues in the image support this pattern, and the coloring aligns with biological expectations. No comparison to Image A is needed here, as the salmon in Image B is clearly depicted with this color gradient.",

      "question": "Are there visible water splashes or ripples around the bear’s lower legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear is standing upright in a classroom environment, not in water. There are no visible water splashes or ripples around its legs, as it is not interacting with any body of water. This contrasts sharply with Image A, where the bear is in a river, and water splashes are clearly visible around its legs. Since the bear in Image B is not in a watery setting, there can be no water effects present. The absence of such elements is expected given the context of the scene.",

      "question": "Does the bear have a long, broad snout with visible nostrils and a rounded muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bear in Image B is anthropomorphic and wears glasses, with facial features modified to resemble a human-like expression. While it has a snout, it is shorter and more rounded than that of a real bear, and the nostrils are not distinctly visible. The muzzle appears stylized and simplified, lacking the broad, elongated snout typical of grizzly bears. In contrast, Image A shows a realistic bear with a prominent, long snout, visible nostrils, and a well-defined muzzle. The anthropomorphic design in Image B prioritizes expressive features over anatomical accuracy, resulting in a less realistic snout.",

      "question": "Is the salmon positioned horizontally in the bear’s mouth, with its head protruding forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear is not holding a salmon in its mouth. Instead, the salmon is shown leaping out of the water in a separate panel. There is no depiction of the salmon being held by the bear. Therefore, the positioning described in the question—horizontal placement with the head protruding forward—is not applicable to this image. In Image A, however, the bear is indeed holding a salmon horizontally in its mouth, with the fish’s head pointing forward. But since Image B does not show this interaction, the answer must reflect the absence of such a scene.",
