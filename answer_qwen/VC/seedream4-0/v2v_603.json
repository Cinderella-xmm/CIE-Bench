      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skier on the left is clearly wearing a red hooded jacket, while the skier on the right is wearing a blue jacket. This is consistent with typical color coding in visual storytelling where contrasting colors are used to differentiate characters. The red jacket has a hood that covers the head, and the blue jacket is a standard winter coat style. Based on visual cues and common sense about clothing representation in stylized images, we can confidently identify the jacket colors. Comparing with Image A, both skiers also wear red and blue jackets respectively, so this detail is preserved in the edit. The transformation from realistic to cartoon style does not alter the color assignment.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both skiers are equipped with skis attached to their boots and ski poles held in their hands. The skis are positioned beneath their feet, extending outward in a typical cross-country skiing stance. The poles are planted into the snow, indicating active use. These elements are essential for skiing and are accurately represented even in the stylized format. In Image A, the original realistic version shows the same equipment configuration—skis and poles are present and properly used. The edit maintains these functional details, suggesting an intentional preservation of skiing authenticity despite the change in art style.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both skiers have black backpacks strapped to their backs. The backpacks are proportionally sized relative to the characters' bodies and appear to be securely fastened, which is typical for outdoor activities like skiing. The material appears to be matte black, consistent with durable outdoor gear. In Image A, the original photo shows similar black backpacks worn by both individuals. The transition to a cartoon style in Image B retains this detail, indicating that the backpacks were important elements in the original composition and thus preserved in the edit. This consistency suggests that the backpacks are part of the core narrative or aesthetic.",

      "question": "** Is the background still a snowy forest with snow-covered trees and a foggy atmosphere?\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features tall evergreen trees covered in snow, consistent with a winter forest environment. The ground is blanketed in snow, and there is a soft, diffused light suggesting fog or mist, creating depth and a sense of atmospheric perspective. This matches the visual characteristics of a snowy forest setting. Comparing with Image A, the original image also depicts a snow-covered forest with foggy conditions, reinforcing that the scene's environmental context has been preserved. The edit maintains the key elements of the landscape—trees, snow, and fog—though rendered in a more stylized manner. Therefore, the background remains fundamentally unchanged in terms of setting and mood.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two skiers are standing close to each other, aligned horizontally, and both are facing forward toward the center of the image, looking into the forest. Their body orientation and gaze direction indicate they are moving ahead together. The positioning suggests companionship and shared purpose. In Image A, the original photo shows the same spatial arrangement—the skiers are side by side and facing forward into the foggy forest path. The edit preserves this compositional choice, maintaining the sense of journey and unity between the two figures. Thus, despite the stylistic shift, the relative positioning and direction remain consistent.",
