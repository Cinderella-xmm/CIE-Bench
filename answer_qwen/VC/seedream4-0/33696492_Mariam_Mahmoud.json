      "question": "Are there exactly three chairs positioned in a row, facing the bookshelf wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three chairs visible in the foreground, arranged in a row and oriented toward the bookshelf wall on the left. These chairs have a natural, rustic design with woven backs and wooden frames. They are evenly spaced and clearly aligned along the same axis, facing the bookshelf. The visual evidence supports that there are exactly three such chairs. This conclusion is based on direct observation of the seating arrangement and their alignment relative to the bookshelf.",

      "question": "Are there two hanging pendant lights located above the seating area, one closer to the center and one toward the right edge of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no traditional pendant lights as seen in typical indoor lighting. Instead, the scene features glowing mushrooms suspended from the tree branches above the seating area. There are multiple mushroom-like lights, but they are not arranged as standard pendant lights. One cluster appears near the center-left above the chairs, while another is further to the right. However, these are not 'pendant lights' in the conventional sense—they are fantastical, bioluminescent mushrooms. Therefore, despite their placement, they do not match the description of two standard hanging pendant lights.",

      "question": "Does the floor display a pattern of parallel diagonal shadows cast by sunlight entering from the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor in Image B shows distinct diagonal shadow patterns created by sunlight filtering through what appears to be foliage or slats in the overhead structure. These shadows run diagonally across the floor from the upper right to the lower left, indicating that light is entering from the right side. The regularity and direction of the shadows suggest a consistent light source, likely sunlight passing through gaps in the tree canopy or slatted roof. This matches the description of parallel diagonal shadows caused by sunlight from the right.",

      "question": "Is there a full-height wall of wooden shelves running along the left side of the room, divided into multiple evenly spaced rectangular compartments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a tall wooden bookshelf along the left side of the room. It extends from floor to ceiling and is composed of multiple rectangular compartments filled with books. The shelving units are uniformly sized and evenly spaced, forming a continuous wall of storage. This matches the description of a full-height shelf wall with regularly spaced compartments. The visual structure aligns with common architectural design for bookshelves in libraries or reading rooms.",

      "question": "Is the floor composed of light-colored wooden planks laid horizontally, extending from foreground to background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor in Image B consists of light-colored wooden planks that run horizontally across the image. These planks extend from the foreground to the background, creating a consistent surface beneath the chairs and moss-covered stones. The alignment and color of the planks are uniform, suggesting a deliberate construction style. The horizontal orientation is clear from the perspective and spacing of the boards. This matches the description provided.",

      "question": "Are there small decorative objects placed within some of the shelf cubbies, including a white vase and a blue box with text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shelf cubbies contain various items, including books, but upon close inspection, there is no visible white vase or blue box with text. The shelves are mostly filled with books, and some small objects like mushrooms or stones are present, but none resemble a white vase or a labeled blue box. This contrasts with typical decorative elements found in such settings. Therefore, the specific objects mentioned are not present in the image.",

      "question": "Is the dominant color palette throughout the room composed of warm golden-brown hues across walls, ceiling, furniture, and flooring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a rich, earthy color scheme dominated by greens, browns, and yellows. While the wooden elements (floor, shelves, chairs) are warm brown tones, the overall palette includes significant green from moss, leaves, and tree bark. The lighting adds golden highlights, especially on the floor and furniture, but the presence of vibrant green elements—especially the glowing mushrooms and moss-covered rocks—means the palette is not exclusively warm golden-brown. Thus, although warm tones are prominent, the dominance of green makes the palette more diverse than described.",
