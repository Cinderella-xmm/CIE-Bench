      "question": "Does the image retain the brown and white pattern characteristic of a giraffe on the nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B are painted with a pattern that mimics the natural coloration of a giraffe, featuring irregular brown patches separated by lighter, cream-colored lines. This pattern is consistent with the typical reticulated or spotted coat of a giraffe, which is a key visual identifier. The use of this pattern on the dolls is intentional and stylistically accurate to represent giraffes, even though they are stylized and cartoonish. Based on visual cues and world knowledge about giraffe markings, the pattern is clearly inspired by real giraffe skin patterns.",

      "question": "Are the ossicones visible on the heads of the nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Ossicones are the horn-like structures found on the heads of giraffes. In Image B, each nesting doll has two small, rounded protrusions on top of their heads, resembling ossicones. These are stylized but recognizable as such, given their placement and shape. While not anatomically precise, they are clearly meant to represent the ossicones of a giraffe, aligning with common artistic interpretations of giraffes in cartoon or toy forms. Thus, based on visual representation and understanding of giraffe anatomy, these features are present and identifiable.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls have elongated necks resembling those of giraffes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are designed with short, rounded necks that do not extend vertically like those of actual giraffes. Giraffes are known for their exceptionally long necks, which are a defining feature. However, the dolls are stylized and simplified, prioritizing cuteness and compactness over anatomical accuracy. Their necks are proportionally short compared to their bodies, which is inconsistent with real giraffe proportions. Therefore, while they may suggest a giraffe-like appearance overall, they do not have elongated necks as seen in real giraffes.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls arranged in descending sizes on the wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are five nesting dolls placed in a row on a wooden table. They are positioned from left to right in decreasing order of size, with the largest doll on the far left and the smallest on the far right. This arrangement is typical for matryoshka (nesting) dolls, where each smaller doll fits inside the larger one. The visual progression of size reduction is clear and consistent, indicating a deliberate descending order. This is supported by both visual observation and general knowledge about how nesting dolls are traditionally displayed.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls have long legs resembling those of a giraffe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B are stylized and cartoonish, with legs depicted as short, stubby, and simplified shapes at the bottom of each doll. Real giraffes have very long, slender legs that are proportionally large compared to their bodies. The legs on these dolls are not elongated and do not resemble the long limbs of a giraffe. Instead, they are drawn in a cute, exaggerated style typical of children's toys. Therefore, despite being giraffe-themed, the dolls do not have long legs as seen in real giraffes.",
