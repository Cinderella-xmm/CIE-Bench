      "question": "Does the edited image retain the butterfly’s four-winged structure with two large upper wings and two smaller lower wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly clearly displays a four-winged structure. There are two large upper wings that extend outward and upward from the body, and two smaller lower wings positioned beneath them. This configuration is typical of many butterfly species and decorative representations thereof. The visual cues—such as the distinct separation between the upper and lower wing pairs and their relative sizes—confirm this structure. Based on common knowledge of butterfly anatomy and ornamental designs, this arrangement aligns with the expected morphology.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly depicted with symmetrical wings on both sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the left and right wings appear to be mirror images of each other in terms of shape, size, and decorative elements. Both upper wings have identical gold embroidery patterns and blue floral motifs, and both lower wings follow the same design symmetry. The placement of the fur trim along the edges is also consistent across both sides. This bilateral symmetry is characteristic of real butterflies and commonly replicated in artistic renditions. Therefore, the wings are symmetrical.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a visible central body connecting the wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central body of the butterfly is clearly visible. It is a dark blue, plush, elongated structure located between the upper and lower wings, serving as the main connector. This body is consistent with typical butterfly anatomy and decorative representations where the thorax connects the wings. The presence of this central element ensures structural integrity in the design and matches biological realism.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a loop or attachment point at the top of the butterfly’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the butterfly’s head in Image B, there is a small, gold-colored metallic loop. This loop appears to be designed for hanging or attaching the ornament to another object, such as a tree branch or display stand. Such loops are common in decorative ornaments and jewelry pieces, allowing for suspension. Its position and form strongly suggest it functions as an attachment point.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned with wings fully spread in a flat, horizontal orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B is displayed with its wings fully extended outward, lying flat against the surface (a satin pillow). The wings are not folded or angled upward; instead, they are arranged horizontally, creating a symmetrical, two-dimensional appearance. This positioning allows for full visibility of the wing details and is typical for display purposes. The flat orientation enhances the aesthetic presentation of the ornament.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the wings proportionally larger than the body, matching the original scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are significantly larger than the central body, which is consistent with natural butterfly proportions. The wings span a much greater area compared to the compact body, reflecting the typical scaling seen in real butterflies and ornamental designs. This proportional relationship emphasizes the wings as the dominant feature, which is both biologically accurate and artistically intentional.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the upper wings have a pointed tip and curved outer edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The upper wings in Image B exhibit a distinct pointed tip at their apex, tapering to a sharp end. Additionally, the outer edges of these wings follow a smooth, curved contour, resembling the natural shape of butterfly forewings. This combination of a pointed tip and curved margin is characteristic of many butterfly species and is faithfully represented here in the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the lower wings visibly smaller and more rounded than the upper wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower wings in Image B are indeed smaller in size compared to the upper wings. They also have a more rounded, less pointed shape, with softer curves along the edges. This contrasts with the sharper, more elongated form of the upper wings. In both real butterflies and stylized representations, the hindwings (lower wings) are typically smaller and more rounded than the forewings (upper wings), making this a realistic and accurate depiction.",
