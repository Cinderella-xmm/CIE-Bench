    "Question": "Q1: Are the armchairs upholstered in brown fabric with light wooden legs?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the armchairs are clearly visible and feature a consistent brown upholstery that appears to be made of a soft, possibly velvet-like fabric. The legs of the armchairs are slender and light in color, matching the appearance of light-toned wood. This is consistent with common furniture design where mid-century modern or contemporary armchairs often use contrasting materials such as rich fabric for comfort and light wood for structure and aesthetic balance. Based on visual cues and typical material pairings in interior design, it is reasonable to conclude that the armchairs are upholstered in brown fabric with light wooden legs.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the armchairs placed symmetrically on either side of the central display area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the two armchairs are positioned equidistant from the centerline of the wall, directly flanking a centrally mounted display screen. The symmetry is evident in their identical orientation, distance from the wall, and alignment relative to the screen. This balanced arrangement is typical in interior design to create a harmonious and inviting space, especially when facing a focal point like a TV or digital display. The positioning suggests intentional symmetry for aesthetic appeal and functional balance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the wall behind the armchairs a plain white surface?",
    "explanation": "The wall in Image B appears uniformly colored without any patterns, textures, or decorations. It is a neutral, off-white or light gray tone, which is commonly used in minimalist or modern interiors to provide a clean backdrop. While not pure white, it is close enough to be considered a plain white surface in general terms. There are no visible imperfections, art, or other elements besides the mounted display, supporting the conclusion that the wall is a plain surface. In interior design contexts, such walls are often referred to as 'plain' even if they have slight color variations from true white.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the floor have a glossy polished wood texture?",
    "explanation": "The floor in Image B displays a warm-toned wood pattern with visible grain lines, suggesting a hardwood surface. However, there is no significant reflection or sheen that would indicate a glossy finish. Instead, the surface appears matte or semi-matte, absorbing rather than reflecting light. Glossy floors typically show clear reflections of objects or lighting, which is absent here. Therefore, while the floor has a wood texture, it lacks the high shine characteristic of a polished, glossy finish.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there soft shadows cast beneath the armchairs on the floor?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, subtle darkening is visible under the armchairs, particularly along the outer edges and near the legs. These areas are slightly darker than the surrounding floor, indicating the presence of shadows caused by ambient lighting. The shadows are diffuse and not sharply defined, suggesting soft, indirect lightingâ€”common in indoor settings. Such soft shadows are typical in well-lit rooms with overhead or ambient light sources, reinforcing the realism of the scene. Hence, soft shadows are indeed present beneath the armchairs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
