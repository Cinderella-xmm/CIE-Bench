      "question": "Does the cat retain its upright ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted as a stylized, cartoonish head mounted on top of a cereal box. The ears are clearly visible and positioned upright, consistent with the typical representation of alertness in cartoon cats. This is a deliberate design choice to make the character appear attentive and engaging. While the ears are not anatomically realistic, they are indeed upright, matching the description in the question. In contrast, Image A shows a real cat with naturally upright ears, but that comparison is only relevant if analyzing transformation. Here, focusing solely on Image B, the ears are upright by design.",

      "question": "Are the cat's large expressive eyes preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat’s eyes are oversized and cartoonish, with large pupils and bright highlights, giving them an exaggeratedly expressive appearance. This is a common stylistic choice in animated or toy-like representations to convey emotion and appeal. While the eyes are not realistic, they are undeniably large and expressive, fulfilling the intent of the question. In Image A, the cat has natural-sized, realistic eyes with clear reflections, but again, the focus here is on Image B. The artistic exaggeration in Image B enhances expressiveness, so the answer reflects the preservation of this trait in a stylized form.",

      "question": "Is the cat's sleek fur texture retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is rendered as a smooth, glossy plastic-like figure with no visible fur texture. Instead of individual hairs or a soft coat, the surface appears uniform and polished, typical of a manufactured product like a toy or mascot. This contrasts sharply with Image A, where the real cat displays fine, detailed fur texture that conveys a natural, sleek appearance. Therefore, while the overall shape and color may resemble a cat, the actual fur texture is not retained in Image B. The material and rendering style prioritize stylization over realism.",

      "question": "Does the cat maintain its upward gaze and posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat’s head is tilted slightly upward, and the eyes are directed upwards, suggesting an upward gaze. The posture is fixed and static, as it is part of a product design (a cereal box topper), but the orientation aligns with an upward-looking expression. This is consistent with the general pose seen in Image A, where the real cat also looks upward. However, in Image B, the posture is more stylized and rigid due to being a 3D model. Despite the difference in medium, the upward gaze is preserved in both images. Thus, based on visual cues in Image B alone, the upward gaze is maintained.",

      "question": "Are the cat's whiskers still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat has clearly defined whiskers drawn on its face, extending from the sides of the nose. These are simplified and stylized, but they are present and visible. Unlike the real cat in Image A, where whiskers are natural and delicate, those in Image B are part of the graphic design. Nevertheless, the presence of whiskers is intentional and clearly depicted. Therefore, despite being cartoonish, the whiskers are still visible in the edited image.",
