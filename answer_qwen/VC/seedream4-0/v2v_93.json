      "question": "Does the thermometer retain its circular shape and metallic rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central gauge maintains a circular shape, consistent with typical analog thermometers. The rim surrounding the dial appears metallic in texture and reflective quality, suggesting it is made of metal or a metallic-like material. This design choice aligns with standard industrial or precision instruments where durability and aesthetic clarity are important. While the overall gauge is embedded within a square frame (which may be part of a larger display), the thermometer itself retains its circular form and metallic border. This conclusion is supported by visual cues such as the curvature of the dial and the shiny, silver-colored edge that reflects light similarly to metal. Thus, despite being framed differently than in a standalone version, the core circular structure and metallic rim are preserved.",

      "question": "Are the temperature scale markings (-2°C to 200°C) clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The temperature scale on the thermometer in Image B displays numerical values ranging from -2°C to 200°C, marked at regular intervals. These markings are black, bold, and legible against the white background of the dial. Smaller tick marks between the numbers indicate intermediate values, which are also visible and evenly spaced. The contrast between the dark markings and the light face enhances readability. Additionally, the presence of dual '°C' symbols near the bottom suggests a focus on clarity and unit identification. Based on these visual features and common design principles for precision instruments, the scale markings are indeed clearly visible. There is no blurring, distortion, or obstruction that would hinder interpretation.",

      "question": "Is the needle present and positioned correctly relative to the temperature scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The needle in Image B is clearly present and extends from the center pivot point of the gauge. It has a transparent, glass-like appearance with a red liquid column inside, resembling a traditional mercury thermometer mechanism. The needle points toward the lower left portion of the dial, near the -2°C mark. Given that the scale starts at -2°C and increases clockwise up to 200°C, this position is consistent with a low-temperature reading. The alignment of the needle with the scale markings appears accurate—there is no indication of misalignment or distortion. Furthermore, the needle's placement corresponds logically with the expected behavior of a thermometer indicating ambient or cold conditions. Therefore, the needle is both present and correctly positioned relative to the scale.",

      "question": "Is the text \"TEMPERATURE\" still visible in the center of the thermometer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'TEMPERATURE' is prominently displayed in uppercase letters across the center of the dial, just above the pivot point of the needle. Its font is bold and clear, ensuring high visibility against the white background. This placement is consistent with standard labeling practices for thermometers, where the purpose of the instrument is explicitly stated. The text remains unobscured by any graphical elements or shadows, confirming its visibility. Although the addition of other elements like the banner and accuracy label might suggest a stylized design, they do not interfere with the legibility of 'TEMPERATURE'. Thus, based on direct observation and design conventions, the text is fully visible.",

      "question": "Does the thermometer retain a white face for clear visibility of the markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face of the thermometer in Image B is predominantly white, providing a high-contrast background for the black numerical markings, tick lines, and text. This color choice is intentional in instrument design to enhance readability and reduce eye strain. Despite the addition of decorative elements such as a blue frame and a ribbon banner, the central dial area remains uniformly white. There are no gradients, discolorations, or overlays that obscure the face. The lighting in the image further emphasizes the brightness and clarity of the white surface. This design adheres to best practices in measurement device interfaces, where a clean, neutral background ensures accurate interpretation of data. Hence, the white face is preserved and contributes effectively to the visibility of all markings.",
