      "question": "Does the image retain the natural skin tones and creases of the human hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand is clearly visible with natural skin tones that appear consistent with typical human skin—light beige with subtle variations in shading due to lighting. The creases on the palm and fingers are well-defined and anatomically accurate, showing natural lines such as the thenar eminence and palmar flexion creases. These features suggest that the hand's texture and appearance have been preserved realistically, despite the addition of the ornate bird design. There is no sign of artificial smoothing or distortion of the skin’s natural topography. Therefore, based on visual cues and common knowledge about human anatomy and photographic realism, the skin tones and creases are retained.",

      "question": "Is the bird still positioned on the center of the palm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B is centrally located within the palm, positioned along the longitudinal axis of the hand, similar to where a small object might naturally rest. Its placement aligns with the center of the palm, avoiding proximity to the edges or fingers. This central positioning is consistent with how an object would be held in the hand for display. Comparing this to Image A, the original tattooed bird was also centered in the palm, suggesting intentional symmetry in composition. In Image B, the artistic enhancement does not shift the bird's location; it remains in the same relative position, maintaining the original spatial arrangement. Thus, the bird is still positioned at the center of the palm.",

      "question": "Is the background still plain and neutral?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is uniformly light gray or off-white, without any distinct patterns, textures, or objects. It appears flat and evenly lit, which suggests a neutral backdrop commonly used in product photography or close-up shots to avoid distractions. This matches the background in Image A, which also features a plain, unobtrusive setting. Since both images share this characteristic, it indicates that the editing process did not introduce a complex or colorful background. The consistency supports the conclusion that the background remains plain and neutral.",

      "question": "Does the bird retain its general swallow-like shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the bird in Image B is highly stylized and ornamental, its overall silhouette retains key features of a swallow: a streamlined body, pointed wings angled upward, and a forked tail. These elements are characteristic of the swallow shape seen in Image A, where the tattoo depicts a simplified but recognizable swallow. Despite the transformation into a golden, filigree design with peacock-like feather details, the general outline and posture remain consistent with a flying swallow. The head, wings, and tail are proportionally aligned to maintain the bird’s dynamic flight pose. Therefore, even though the style has changed dramatically, the general swallow-like shape is preserved.",

      "question": "Are the fingers of the hand still slightly spread apart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fingers of the hand are slightly spread apart, particularly noticeable between the index and middle fingers, and the ring and pinky fingers. This slight separation creates space around the palm, allowing the bird to be fully visible and centered. This positioning is consistent with the hand's pose in Image A, where the fingers are similarly relaxed and gently splayed. Such a pose is typical when displaying something in the palm, as it provides stability and visibility. The editing process has not altered the hand’s natural gesture, so the fingers remain slightly spread apart.",
