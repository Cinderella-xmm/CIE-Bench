      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is clearly depicted wearing a light-colored, wide-brimmed hat that resembles a straw hat commonly associated with sunny, Mediterranean climates. The hat's shape and texture are consistent with traditional straw hats used for sun protection. This visual cue, combined with common knowledge about such hats being worn in warm, outdoor environments like those seen in Italian towns (which the background suggests), supports the conclusion that it is indeed a wide-brimmed straw hat.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The man in Image B has a prominent facial hair growth that includes both a full beard and mustache. Both are white, indicating age, and are well-defined and neatly trimmed. This matches the typical appearance of an elderly man in a relaxed, possibly Mediterranean setting. The style and color are consistent with common portrayals of older men in such artistic depictions, reinforcing the accuracy of this observation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scooter in Image B features a single, round headlight located centrally on the front panel. Its shape is distinctly circular, which is characteristic of classic scooters such as the Vespa. This design element is consistent with vintage scooter models and is visually clear in the image. The presence of a circular headlight aligns with real-world scooter designs from mid-20th century Italy, supporting the identification.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Below the circular headlight on the scooter in Image B, there is a visible metal grille with a grid-like structure. It appears to be made of chrome or polished metal, matching the aesthetic of vintage scooters. This grille is positioned directly beneath the headlight and serves both functional and decorative purposes, typical of classic scooter designs. The visual details confirm its presence and material.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the front of the scooter in Image B, there is a metal rack attached just above the front wheel. It is constructed of thin metal bars forming a rectangular grid, designed to carry items. This type of rack is commonly found on utility scooters and is consistent with the Vespa-style design shown. The placement and structure match known configurations of such racks, confirming its presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scooter in Image B clearly has two wheels — one at the front and one at the rear. Both wheels feature visible tires with defined tread patterns. Additionally, the hub area shows a distinct spoke pattern, especially noticeable on the front wheel. These details are consistent with real scooter construction, where spoked wheels are common in vintage models. The clarity of these elements in the image confirms their presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is seated on the scooter with his right leg resting on the footrest and his left leg slightly bent, not fully extended. His posture is relaxed but not symmetrically stretched forward. While the right leg is extended, the left leg is more tucked in, suggesting he is not fully extending both legs forward. Therefore, the description 'both legs extended forward' does not accurately reflect the pose.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ground in Image B shows a textured surface composed of stones laid in a pattern. Upon close inspection, the stones are irregular in shape and size, and they are arranged in a diagonal, interlocking layout that is characteristic of a herringbone pattern. This type of paving is common in historic European cities, particularly in Italy, which aligns with the architectural style of the buildings in the background. The visual evidence supports the presence of a herringbone cobblestone pavement.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the background of Image B, several buildings feature arched doorways. One such archway is clearly visible on the right side of the scene, and it is flanked by windows with green shutters. These shutters are consistent in color and style with those commonly found in Mediterranean architecture. The combination of an arched entrance and green window shutters confirms the presence of this architectural detail.",
