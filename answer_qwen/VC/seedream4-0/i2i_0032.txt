    "Question": "Q1: Is the skater depicted balancing on a grind rail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is no longer visible. Instead, the image has been edited to feature cartoon food items such as a banana, cookie, egg, cheese, and rice, which are superimposed over the original scene. The presence of these animated characters obscures the skater and the skateboarding action entirely. Based on visual cues, there is no indication of a skater or a grind rail in the foreground. The original context of skateboarding is replaced by a whimsical overlay, so it cannot be confirmed that the skater is balancing on a grind rail. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the skateboard retain the pink wheels?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is partially visible beneath the cartoon characters, but it is heavily obscured. However, based on the portion of the skateboard that can be seen, especially near the front, the wheels appear to still have a pink coloration. This suggests that the pink wheels from the original image have not been altered in this edit. While the cartoon overlay dominates, the underlying image retains key details like wheel color. Thus, the skateboard does retain the pink wheels.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the chain-link fence visible in the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the addition of cartoon food stickers, the background elements such as the chain-link fence are still visible behind the overlays. The fence's grid pattern and metallic structure can be seen through the gaps between the cartoon characters. This indicates that the fence remains present in the background, even though it is partially covered. The editing process did not remove the fence, only added elements over it. Therefore, the chain-link fence is still visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the white pants and green belt present on the skater?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is completely replaced by cartoon food items. There is no visible human figure or clothing in the image. The original skater’s attire—white pants and green belt—is no longer present because the entire figure has been obscured by the edited content. The cartoon characters cover the area where the skater was located, making it impossible to see any part of the clothing. Hence, the white pants and green belt are not present in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the dark blue evening sky still visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sky in the upper portion of the image remains a dark blue color, consistent with the original image. Although cartoon characters are placed over the sky, they do not fully obscure it. The dark blue hue is still clearly visible in the areas not covered by the stickers. This indicates that the sky has not been altered in terms of color or lighting. Therefore, the dark blue evening sky is still visible in the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
