        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bee collectible is clearly visible inside the display box. The body of the bee features alternating yellow and black stripes, which are characteristic of a typical honeybee design. This pattern is consistent with common representations of bees in decorative items. The visual cues—such as the distinct color blocks and their arrangement—confirm that the yellow and black striped pattern is preserved. There is no indication of deviation from this pattern in the image.",

      "question": "Are the wings of the bee collectible depicted as translucent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the bee collectible in Image B, the wings appear to have a shimmering, iridescent quality with embedded sparkles or glitter-like elements, giving them a reflective and somewhat translucent appearance. Translucency is suggested by the way light seems to pass through the wings, creating a glowing effect, especially under the warm lighting inside the box. This visual effect is often used in collectibles to simulate translucency, even if it's not fully transparent. Based on these visual cues and common artistic techniques in jewelry and collectibles, the wings are depicted as translucent.",

      "question": "Does the flower collectible have yellow petals and a green stem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flower collectible is positioned next to the bee within the display box. The petals are uniformly yellow, matching the color scheme of the bee, and the stem is clearly green, extending downward from the flower head. This combination of yellow petals and a green stem aligns with typical floral designs in collectibles and matches the aesthetic of nature-inspired themes. The colors are vivid and well-defined, confirming the presence of both yellow petals and a green stem.",

      "question": "Are the bee and flower collectibles positioned side by side within the display box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two collectibles—the bee and the flower—are placed horizontally next to each other inside the open display box. The bee is on the left, and the flower is on the right, both resting on the same surface within the box. Their alignment and proximity suggest a deliberate side-by-side arrangement, commonly used in product displays to highlight pairing or thematic connection. This positioning is consistent with standard presentation practices for collectible sets.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lid of the display box in Image B clearly shows the text 'ETERNITY BLOSSOM' printed in an elegant font, centered on the top surface. The text is surrounded by decorative floral motifs and stars, reinforcing its branding purpose. This inscription matches the label seen on the card in Image A, indicating consistency in branding across packaging. The visibility and clarity of the text confirm that it is indeed present on the lid.",
