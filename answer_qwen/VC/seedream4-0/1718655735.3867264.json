      "question": "Does the edited image retain the angular, filigree-patterned metallic mask covering the upper face, including the prominent crest and eye-covering section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fairy is clearly wearing a detailed mask that covers the upper portion of her face. The mask features sharp, angular contours and intricate filigree patterns consistent with ornate metalwork. A prominent crest extends upward from the center of the mask, and the eye area is fully covered by the design, matching the structure seen in typical fantasy or steampunk-inspired masks. This aligns with both visual cues and common design elements in fantasy art where such masks symbolize mystique or transformation. Comparing to Image A, the mask’s form, including the crest and eye coverage, remains unchanged in shape and placement, confirming continuity in design. Thus, the mask is retained in its original form.",

      "question": "Are the butterfly wings retained with their original veined structure and mottled brown-orange coloration, even if rendered with a metallic or shimmering surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings are visible behind the fairy, displaying a clear network of veins that mimic natural wing anatomy. However, the coloration has shifted significantly—instead of the mottled brown-orange tones seen in Image A, the wings now have a silvery, metallic sheen with hints of iridescence. While the structural veins remain intact, the coloration is no longer brown-orange but rather reflective and luminous. This suggests an artistic enhancement or reinterpretation of the original wing design, possibly to match the enclosed, glass-case aesthetic. Therefore, while the veined structure is preserved, the original coloration is not.",

      "question": "Is the thin wire or cord extending from the base of the left wing still present and connected to the wing structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, a thin, dark line can be observed extending downward from the lower edge of the left wing. This appears to be a wire or cord, similar to those used in mechanical or articulated models to simulate movement or support. It is attached to the wing's base and trails off toward the bottom of the glass dome. In Image A, such a wire was also visible, suggesting it was part of the original design. Its presence in Image B confirms continuity in this detail, likely serving a functional or aesthetic purpose in the model’s construction. Therefore, the wire remains present and connected.",

      "question": "Does the outfit retain the halter-neck silhouette with lace-like embroidery along the torso and arms, including the high waist and fitted form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fairy’s attire maintains a halter-neck design, with the top of the dress wrapping around the neck and shoulders without sleeves. The torso is adorned with intricate lace-like embroidery that follows the contours of the body, consistent with the ornate style seen in Image A. The waistline is high and defined, contributing to a fitted silhouette that flares into a layered skirt. These elements are preserved, indicating that the overall design and structure of the outfit have been maintained despite the change in context (now enclosed in a glass dome). The craftsmanship and attention to detail in the embroidery suggest intentional retention of the original aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the fairy depicted in a side profile pose, with her head slightly turned toward the viewer and her gaze directed forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fairy is positioned in a side profile, facing right, with her body angled slightly toward the viewer. Her head is turned forward enough to reveal one eye and part of her facial features, though the mask obscures much of her expression. The direction of her gaze appears to be forward, as suggested by the alignment of her head and the positioning of her eyes beneath the mask. This pose mirrors the stance in Image A, where the same orientation was present. The consistency in posture indicates that the pose has been preserved in the edited version, maintaining the character’s elegant and contemplative demeanor.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fairy’s ears are partially visible beneath the mask, and delicate, elongated earrings can be seen hanging down from them. These earrings appear to consist of small beads or metallic elements arranged in a chain-like fashion, consistent with the style seen in Image A. Despite the change in lighting and background, the earrings remain clearly visible, especially on the right ear. Their presence adds to the ornamental detail of the character’s appearance and supports the idea that accessories were intentionally preserved in the edit.",

      "question": "Are the subject’s eyes closed and her lips painted red, matching the original appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fairy’s eyes are obscured by the mask, so their open or closed state cannot be determined directly. However, in Image A, the eyes were visibly closed, and the lips were painted a vivid red. In Image B, the red lip color is still apparent, matching the original. Since the mask covers the eyes entirely, it is impossible to confirm whether they are closed based solely on Image B. Yet, given that the pose and expression are consistent with the original, it is reasonable to infer that the eyes remain closed. However, the question specifically asks about visibility and matching appearance. Since the eyes are hidden, we cannot verify their state. But the lips are clearly red and match the original. Therefore, only part of the condition is verifiable.",
