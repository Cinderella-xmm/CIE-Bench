    "Question": "Q1: Is there a snowboard visible beneath the snowboarder’s feet?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboard is clearly visible beneath the snowboarder's feet. It is depicted in a stylized, paper-cut art form with a dark blue base and red text that reads 'SHIGRAN'. The board extends horizontally under her boots, consistent with how a snowboard would appear when being ridden. The visual cues—such as the positioning of the boots on the board and the board's distinct shape—are unmistakable indicators of its presence. This conclusion aligns with real-world knowledge: a snowboard is essential for snowboarding and must be directly under the rider’s feet.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the snowboarder’s boots visibly attached to the snowboard?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder’s boots are shown positioned on the snowboard, and their placement suggests attachment via bindings, which are standard in snowboarding equipment. Although the bindings themselves are not explicitly detailed due to the artistic style (paper-cut), the boots are securely placed on the board in a way that matches typical snowboarding posture. In real-world snowboarding, boots are fastened to the board using bindings, and the image reflects this functional arrangement. The visual alignment and the absence of any gap or floating boot confirm that they are attached.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is a backpack visible on the snowboarder’s back with shoulder straps?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a backpack is clearly visible on the snowboarder’s back. It is rendered in dark blue and has two distinct shoulder straps extending over her shoulders, consistent with the design of a typical hiking or ski backpack. The backpack appears to be secured with buckles and straps, which are common features in outdoor gear. This observation is supported by world knowledge: skiers and snowboarders often carry backpacks for essentials like water, gloves, or extra layers, and these packs are typically worn with shoulder straps for stability and balance during movement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the snowboarder wear an orange-red ski suit with white diagonal stripes on the legs and torso?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder is wearing a vibrant orange-red ski suit. White diagonal stripes are clearly visible along both legs and across the torso, running from the shoulder area down toward the waist. These stripes are stylistic elements commonly found in skiwear for visibility and aesthetic appeal. The color scheme and stripe pattern match the description exactly. The paper-cut art style enhances the geometric clarity of the stripes, making them easy to identify. Based on real-world ski apparel design, such patterns are common in performance outerwear.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the snowboarder’s face visible with long brown hair flowing behind her?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder’s face is fully visible. She has long hair that flows backward, suggesting motion, and it appears to be a mix of dark brown and reddish tones, possibly due to lighting or artistic interpretation. Her facial features are clearly defined, including eyes, nose, and mouth, which are consistent with a human figure in motion. The hair is depicted as dynamic, swept back by wind, which is typical in action scenes involving speed. This aligns with world knowledge: snowboarders often have their hair blowing in the wind while descending slopes, and artists use this effect to convey movement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are snow-covered pine trees and distant mountains visible in the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background features stylized snow-covered pine trees and distant mountain ranges. The trees are represented in layered, angular forms typical of paper art, but their conical shapes and snow-laden branches are unmistakably those of pine trees. The mountains in the distance are also depicted in a similar layered fashion, with sharp peaks and snow caps. These elements are consistent with alpine environments where snowboarding occurs. The artistic style simplifies natural forms but retains recognizable features based on real-world geography and winter landscapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the snowboarder in a forward-leaning, crouched posture indicative of descending motion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder is positioned in a forward-leaning, crouched stance. Her knees are bent, her body is angled slightly forward, and her arms are positioned for balance—hallmarks of a snowboarder in motion, particularly during descent. This posture is biomechanically appropriate for maintaining control and stability at speed. The artistic rendering captures this dynamic pose effectively, even within the constraints of paper-cut design. Real-world snowboarding involves such postures to manage momentum and terrain, so this depiction is consistent with actual behavior.",
    "answer": "Yes"
