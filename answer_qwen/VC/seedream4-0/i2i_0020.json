      "question": "Is the train represented in a red-and-gray color block scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is depicted using a stylized, flat design aesthetic. The body of the train features a prominent red horizontal stripe running along its side, which is consistent with the red color seen on real-world trains like those operated by SBB (Swiss Federal Railways). The rest of the train's body is primarily gray or dark blue, with white accents on the roof and windows. This combination of red and gray (or dark blue) forms a distinct color block scheme. Based on visual cues and common design practices in simplified illustrations, this representation aligns with a red-and-gray color block scheme, even if some elements are abstracted.",

      "question": "Is the sign circular with the text \"STOP\" clearly displayed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sign in Image B is not circular; it is an octagon, which is the standard shape for stop signs in many countries, including Switzerland. The red octagonal shape contains the word 'STOP' in bold, white capital letters, which is clearly legible. While the overall sign is mounted on a blue rectangular background, the stop symbol itself follows the conventional design. Therefore, although the text 'STOP' is clearly displayed, the shape is not circular but octagonal. Thus, the answer must reflect that the sign is not circular.",

      "question": "Is the train positioned parallel to the tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is aligned horizontally along the track lines, which are drawn as straight, parallel lines extending into the distance. The trainâ€™s body runs along the same axis as the tracks, indicating that it is positioned parallel to them. This alignment is consistent with how trains are typically depicted in both realistic and stylized representations when stationary or moving along rails. The perspective suggests a side view where the train maintains a consistent orientation relative to the tracks. Therefore, based on visual geometry and common sense about railway layout, the train is indeed parallel to the tracks.",

      "question": "Are there green mountain outlines in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features simplified, geometric shapes representing mountains. These shapes are rendered in shades of green and light blue, forming layered peaks that suggest a mountainous landscape. The use of green is typical for depicting natural terrain in illustrative designs, especially when referencing alpine regions such as those found in Switzerland. Although stylized, the visual cues clearly indicate green mountain outlines in the background. This matches common artistic conventions used in cartography and transportation-themed illustrations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railway tracks are represented by a series of parallel lines beneath the train. These lines are stylized and lack detailed textures such as wooden sleepers or gravel ballast, which are present in real-world tracks. Instead, they consist of clean, straight lines in alternating colors (gray and red), suggesting a simplified or abstract representation. This style is typical in graphic illustrations where realism is sacrificed for clarity and visual appeal. Therefore, the presence of simplified track lines is evident and consistent with the overall minimalist design of the image.",
