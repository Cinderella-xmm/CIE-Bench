      "question": "Does the edited image depict exactly eight arms extending from the central head mass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus sculpture is clearly visible with multiple arms extending from a central head mass. By counting each arm individually, we can observe that there are eight distinct arms present. This aligns with biological knowledge of octopuses, which naturally have eight arms. The arms appear to be symmetrically arranged around the head, and their number matches the expected anatomy of an octopus. Therefore, based on visual inspection and biological understanding, the sculpture accurately represents the correct number of arms.",

      "question": "Is there a distinct, rounded central head mass from which all arms originate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sculpture of an octopus with a clearly defined, rounded central head mass. This head mass is elevated above the base and serves as the origin point for all eight arms. The shape is consistent with the typical morphology of an octopus, where the mantle (head) is bulbous and houses the internal organs. The arms extend outward and downward from this central structure, indicating a clear anatomical separation between the head and limbs. This feature is both visually evident and biologically accurate.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arms exhibit a flowing, undulating arrangement that mirrors the wave patterns of the original ocean scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a ceramic octopus sculpture placed on a sandy surface, not in water. While the arms do have a curved, undulating form that gives them a sense of movement, they are rigid and static due to being made of ceramic. There is no actual ocean or wave pattern present in the image; instead, the background is plain sand. Therefore, although the arms are artistically shaped with curves, they do not mirror any wave patterns because there is no ocean scene to reference. Unlike Image A, which shows an octopus in a dynamic ocean environment with waves, Image B lacks such context. Thus, the arms’ arrangement does not mirror wave patterns.",

      "question": "Are there visible surface textures on the sculptures that mimic the original skin's ridges and suction cup patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture’s surface features a detailed texture composed of overlapping scales or diamond-like patterns along the arms and head. These textures resemble fish scales rather than the natural skin ridges and suction cups found on real octopuses. Real octopus skin has a soft, slightly bumpy texture with suction cups lining the undersides of the arms. However, the sculpture uses a stylized, artistic interpretation with a glossy blue glaze and scale-like design, which is more decorative than anatomically accurate. Therefore, while there are visible textures, they do not accurately mimic the original skin’s ridges and suction cup patterns.",

      "question": "Does the sculpture maintain the same general silhouette and proportional relationship between the head and arms as the original octopus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture has a large, rounded head and long, extended arms, which generally reflect the silhouette of an octopus. The proportion between the head and arms appears balanced and similar to that seen in Image A, where the octopus also has a prominent head and elongated arms. Although the material and texture differ—Image A shows a fleshy, organic appearance while Image B is a ceramic sculpture—the overall shape and relative size of the head and arms remain consistent. The arms are not disproportionately long or short compared to the head, preserving the general anatomical proportions. Thus, despite differences in medium and detail, the sculpture maintains the same general silhouette and proportional relationship.",
