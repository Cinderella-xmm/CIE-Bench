    "Question": "Q1: Is the large tree trunk with textured bark positioned on the left side of the image, partially obscuring the rear wheel of the bicycle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the large tree trunk is clearly visible on the left side of the frame. It has a detailed, textured bark consistent with a mature tree. The bicycle is leaning against this tree, and its rear wheel is indeed partially hidden behind the trunk, as the tree extends vertically and blocks part of the wheel from view. This positioning is typical in scenes where a bike is parked beside a tree for support. Based on visual cues, the tree's placement and size confirm that it is on the left and overlaps with the rear wheel.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the bicycle make direct contact with the tree trunk, leaning against it on its left side?",
    "explanation": "The bicycle in Image B is shown leaning to its right, with its left side pressed against the tree trunk. The frame appears to be in physical contact with the tree, which is a common way bicycles are propped up when parked. The angle of the bike and the proximity of the frame to the trunk suggest stable contact, supporting the idea that it is leaning against the tree. This aligns with real-world behavior of how bikes are typically supported when stationary.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a continuous road stretching from the foreground into the background, aligned horizontally across the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a paved road is visible running diagonally from the lower right toward the center background. It curves gently and does not stretch horizontally across the entire image. Instead, it follows a natural arc, suggesting a rural or scenic route. While the road extends into the distance, it is not aligned horizontally but rather at an angle. Therefore, it is not a straight horizontal road spanning the full width of the image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there exactly three motorcyclists riding in a straight line along the road in the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background features three small, stylized figures riding bicycles, not motorcycles. These characters are cartoonish in design and are riding standard children’s bikes. There are no motorcyclists present; instead, they are all on pedal-powered bicycles. The vehicles are arranged in a loose line, but they are not motorbikes. Thus, the description of 'motorcyclists' is incorrect based on visual evidence.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the bicycle located on the left side of the image, with the road and motorcyclists positioned to the right and extending into the distance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle is indeed positioned on the left side of the frame, leaning against the tree. To the right of the bicycle, the road curves outward and extends into the background, where three children are riding bicycles. Although the road and riders are on the right, they do extend into the distance, creating depth. However, the key point is that the bicycle is on the left, and the activity (road and riders) is on the right, which matches the description. The term 'motorcyclists' is inaccurate here, but the spatial layout described in the question — bicycle on the left, road and riders on the right — is correct.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the rear wheel of the bicycle partially obscured by the tree trunk?",
    "explanation": "Yes, the rear wheel of the bicycle is partially hidden behind the tree trunk. The tree is positioned directly behind the back portion of the bike, and the wheel is cut off by the trunk’s edge in the image. This is visually evident as only part of the wheel is visible, with the rest blocked by the tree. This is consistent with how objects are obscured when placed close to larger structures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a round headlight mounted on the front fork of the bicycle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle has a small, round object mounted on the front fork near the handlebars. It resembles a headlight in shape and placement, though it appears more decorative than functional due to the stylized, cartoon-like design of the bike. However, it is clearly a round component attached to the front fork, consistent with a headlight’s position. Even if stylized, the visual cue supports the presence of such a feature.",
    "answer": "Yes"
