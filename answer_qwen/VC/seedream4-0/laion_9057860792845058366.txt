    "Question": "Q1: Are the two orange horn-like protrusions on the top of the robot's head present and unchanged in shape and position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's head features two prominent orange horn-like protrusions extending upward from the sides of the head. These are clearly visible and symmetrically placed, consistent with typical mechanical design aesthetics seen in mecha models. Their shape appears angular and geometric, matching the overall style of the robot. Comparing this to Image A, both images show identical positioning and form of these horns—no deformation or repositioning is evident. The visual cues confirm that the horns are present and have not been altered in shape or placement. This consistency supports the conclusion that they remain unchanged.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the large red rectangular plate on the robot's chest intact, maintaining its original size, shape, and placement?",
    "explanation": "The chest area of the robot in Image B displays a prominent red rectangular plate centered on the torso. Its dimensions and angular geometry match those seen in Image A. There is no visible distortion, resizing, or repositioning; it remains aligned with the central axis of the body. Additionally, the surrounding gray armor panels maintain their relative spacing, reinforcing that the red plate has not been modified. From a design standpoint, such plates are often used as structural or aesthetic focal points, and their preservation here suggests intentional fidelity to the original model. Thus, based on visual analysis and comparison with Image A, the plate remains intact.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the red knee pads present on both legs, positioned at the joint area and matching the original shape and color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both legs of the robot feature distinct red components located at the knee joints. These elements are trapezoidal in shape, consistent with the angular design language of the robot. They are positioned precisely where knee articulation would occur, matching the placement observed in Image A. The color is vivid red, matching the other red accents across the body (such as the chest and shoulders), indicating continuity in color scheme. No signs of omission, replacement, or alteration are visible. Therefore, the knee pads are present, correctly positioned, and retain their original shape and color.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the hands of the robot fully black, with a claw-like or articulated finger design, and positioned as in the original?",
    "explanation": "The hands in Image B are entirely black and exhibit a segmented, claw-like structure with defined fingers, consistent with mechanical robotic hands. The articulation and shape suggest flexibility and grip capability, common in mecha designs. The left hand is slightly raised, while the right is lowered, mirroring the pose in Image A. Both hands maintain the same orientation and position relative to the arms. The black coloring is uniform without any added textures or color changes. Based on visual inspection and comparison to Image A, there is no deviation in design or placement. Hence, the hands are fully black, claw-like, and positioned as originally intended.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the robot’s feet maintain their angular, blocky shape with black toe segments and red accent plates near the ankles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot’s feet display a distinctly angular and blocky design, characteristic of mecha aesthetics. The toes are dark-colored, appearing black, and are segmented in a way that suggests durability and mechanical function. Near the ankle region, red accent plates are visible, matching the color scheme and placement seen in Image A. These red elements are triangular or trapezoidal and align with the joint areas. The overall foot structure remains consistent in shape, color distribution, and proportion. Therefore, the feet preserve their original design features.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the robot in the same dynamic standing pose, with the left arm slightly raised and the body angled toward the viewer?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the robot in a dynamic stance where the left arm is elevated slightly above the waist level, while the right arm hangs lower. The torso is angled forward, giving a sense of movement and readiness. This posture closely matches the one in Image A, where the same limb positioning and body angle are evident. The leg stance—left leg slightly bent, right leg extended—also corresponds. Despite the darker background and added digital overlays in Image B, the physical pose of the robot remains unchanged. Thus, the robot maintains the same dynamic pose as in the original.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the primary colors of the robot—white, gray, red, and orange—preserved in their original distribution and intensity?",
    "explanation": "The color palette in Image B includes white for the main body, gray for structural elements like joints and armor plating, red for key accent areas (chest, knees, ankles), and orange for the head horns. These colors are distributed consistently with Image A. The intensity of each color appears accurate: the red is vibrant but not oversaturated, the orange is bright yet realistic, and the whites and grays are clean and balanced. While Image B introduces glowing blue UI elements and a dark background, these do not affect the robot’s own coloration. The original color distribution and intensity are preserved despite the enhanced lighting and visual effects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
