      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted in a yoga pose where her left leg is bent and lifted high, extending backward. Her hands are positioned to grasp her foot, forming a loop above her head. This posture is consistent with advanced yoga poses such as Natarajasana (Dancer’s Pose), where the raised leg is typically held behind the body by the hand. The visual cues show that both hands are engaged in holding the foot of the raised leg, which is extended behind her torso. Based on this observation and common knowledge of yoga anatomy and alignment, it can be concluded that the left leg is indeed raised and held behind her back with both hands.",

      "question": "Is the sun located directly behind the subject’s torso, forming a halo-like glow around her silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows a large, bright circular object resembling the sun positioned behind the subject. However, the sun is not directly aligned with the center of her torso but appears slightly offset to the upper right side of the frame. While there is a warm glow illuminating the scene, the halo effect around the subject's silhouette is minimal due to the positioning of the sun. In contrast, in Image A, the sun is centrally placed behind the subject, creating a strong backlighting effect and a clear halo around her figure. In Image B, the lighting is softer and less dramatic, lacking the intense silhouette glow seen in Image A. Therefore, the sun is not directly behind the subject’s torso in a way that creates a pronounced halo effect.",

      "question": "Is the beach surface visibly wet, showing reflections of the sun and ocean waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beach surface beneath the subject appears smooth and reflective, indicating moisture from receding tides. There are visible light patterns and subtle reflections that suggest the presence of water on the sand. These reflections resemble the shimmering effect of sunlight bouncing off wet surfaces, commonly observed during low tide or after wave activity. Additionally, the texture of the sand is darker near the waterline, further supporting the idea of wetness. This aligns with real-world observations of beaches at sunrise or sunset when the shoreline is often damp and reflective. Although the reflection is not as vivid as in Image A, the visual cues still indicate that the surface is wet and reflective.",

      "question": "Are there two distinct rocky landforms visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a coastal landscape with a body of water and distant landmasses. On the left side of the frame, there is a prominent rocky outcrop extending into the sea. On the right side, another rock formation is visible, though it appears smaller and less defined than the one on the left. Both formations are separated by open water and contribute to the scenic composition. This matches the typical layout of coastal environments where islands or headlands flank a beach. Comparing this to Image A, the same two landforms are present, but they are more detailed and integrated into the natural lighting. In Image B, while the details are simplified, the presence of two distinct rocky landforms on either side of the frame is still evident.",

      "question": "Is the subject standing barefoot on the sand, with the sole of her right foot flat against the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is shown standing on one leg, with her right foot planted firmly on the sand. The sole of the right foot is fully in contact with the ground, and the toes are slightly spread, suggesting balance and stability. The depiction of the foot is consistent with being barefoot, as no footwear is visible. The position of the foot is anatomically accurate for a balancing pose like Natarajasana. In comparison to Image A, the same posture is maintained, and the foot remains flat on the ground. However, in Image B, the rendering is slightly stylized, but the essential detail of the flat sole is preserved. Therefore, based on visual evidence and anatomical reasoning, the subject is standing barefoot with the sole of her right foot flat against the ground.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject has dark hair that is gathered and secured at the back of her head. The shape and tightness of the hairstyle suggest a bun, which is a common style for physical activities like yoga to keep hair out of the face. The bun appears compact and neatly arranged, without loose strands. This is consistent with both practicality and aesthetic considerations in fitness imagery. In Image A, the same hairstyle is present, confirming the consistency between the two images. Thus, based on visual analysis and common practices in athletic wear, the subject’s hair is tied into a neat bun.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s head is clearly tilted back, and her gaze is directed upward toward the sky. The angle of her neck and the position of her chin indicate an upward tilt, which is typical in yoga poses that emphasize openness and extension. This posture is also consistent with the overall flow of the pose, where the spine is arched and the body is reaching upward. In Image A, the same head position is observed, reinforcing the accuracy of this description. The upward tilt enhances the sense of grace and connection with the environment, especially given the setting sun in the background. Therefore, the subject’s head is indeed tilted upward with her face angled toward the sky.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean is depicted with gentle ripples and small waves approaching the shore. However, there are no clear signs of waves actively breaking or forming whitecaps along the immediate shoreline in front of the subject. The water appears calm and reflective, suggesting a tranquil moment rather than active wave motion. In contrast, Image A shows more dynamic wave action, including white foam and visible breakers. In Image B, the waves are stylized and simplified, likely to maintain visual harmony within the book page format. Therefore, while the ocean is present, there are no distinct breaking waves visible in front of the subject.",
