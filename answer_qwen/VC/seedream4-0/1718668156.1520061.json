      "question": "Is the amber-colored liquid visible in the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the short glass on the left contains a liquid that appears to have an amber hue, consistent with beverages like iced tea or cola. Despite the pixelated and stylized rendering of the image, the coloration of the liquid inside the glass is clearly distinguishable as amber. The visual cues such as light refraction through the glass and the shading suggest a translucent liquid with this color. This conclusion is supported by common knowledge about how liquids appear in glasses under lighting conditions similar to those depicted (sunset-like ambient light). The pixelation does not obscure the color enough to negate its visibility.",

      "question": "Is a yellow straw inserted into the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a yellow object resembling a straw is clearly visible extending from the top of the short glass into the liquid. The shape and position are consistent with a drinking straw, and its bright yellow color stands out against the darker tones of the drink and the background. Even though the image has a pixelated, digital art style, the form and placement of the object match the typical appearance of a straw in a beverage. This aligns with common sense and real-world expectations of how straws are used in drinks.",

      "question": "Are ice cubes visible within the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple white, blocky shapes are present within the short glass, floating in the amber liquid. These shapes are consistent in appearance with ice cubes, especially given their irregular forms and reflective qualities. Although the image is rendered in a pixelated, retro-futuristic style, the objects inside the glass still resemble ice cubes based on their size, shape, and placement relative to the liquid level. This interpretation is supported by general knowledge of how ice is typically served in cold drinks.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall glass on the right appears to be entirely composed of ice-like structures, with no visible liquid beneath. The entire volume of the glass is filled with what looks like stacked, crystalline blocks that resemble ice, and there is no indication of a liquid layer at the bottom. The visual design suggests a full ice fill, possibly for aesthetic or thematic purposes (e.g., futuristic or cyberpunk styling). Based on the visual information and the absence of any liquid surface, it is reasonable to conclude that the glass is completely filled with ice.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the iconic structure of the Sydney Opera House is clearly visible in the background, with its distinctive sail-like shells outlined in neon blue and pink lights. The geometric shapes and arrangement of the shells are unmistakably those of the Opera House, even though they are stylized with a pixelated, glowing effect. This artistic rendering preserves the recognizable silhouette and architectural features of the building, confirming that the sail-like shells are indeed visible.",

      "question": "Is there a stone ledge beneath the two glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two glasses are placed on a flat, textured surface that resembles a stone or concrete ledge. The material has a rough, earthy tone and casts shadows consistent with a solid, outdoor platform. While the image is stylized with digital effects, the surface supports the weight of the glasses and shows realistic depth and texture, which aligns with the appearance of a stone ledge. This conclusion is supported by the context of the scene—drinks placed outdoors near a waterfront—which commonly involves such ledges.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two glasses are clearly positioned next to each other on the same ledge. The shorter glass containing the amber liquid is located on the left side of the frame, while the taller, ice-filled glass is on the right. Their relative positions are consistent across both images, and the spatial arrangement is unambiguous. This positioning is maintained despite the stylistic changes in Image B, such as pixelation and neon lighting, which do not alter the fundamental layout of the objects. Therefore, the description matches the visual evidence.",
