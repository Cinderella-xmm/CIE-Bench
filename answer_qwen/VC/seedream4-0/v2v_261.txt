    "Question": "Q1: Is the surfboard depicted with an elongated oval shape and a central stringer running along its length?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surfboard is visible inside a snow globe. The board has a clearly defined elongated oval shape, typical of standard surfboards. A central line, resembling a stringer (a structural element often found in surfboards), runs along the length of the board. This feature is common in surfboard design for added strength and performance. The visual cues in the image—such as the symmetrical shape and the central ridge—align with real-world surfboard anatomy. Although the scale is smaller due to the snow globe context, the proportions and features are consistent with a realistic representation of a surfboard.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a small white wax block being held by the right hand and applied to the surface of the surfboard?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure inside the snow globe is holding a small object in its right hand, which is positioned over the surfboard. The object appears to be white and block-shaped, consistent with the appearance of surf wax. Given that surfers typically use wax to grip the board, and this action is part of pre-surfing preparation, it is reasonable to infer that this object is surf wax. The context of the scene—a surfer preparing their board—supports this interpretation. The size and shape of the object match typical surf wax blocks used in real life.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the right hand positioned so that the fingers are gripping the wax block and making direct contact with the surfboard’s surface?",
    "explanation": "Observing the figure's right hand in Image B, the fingers are curled around the white block, indicating a gripping motion. The block is touching the surface of the surfboard, suggesting active application of wax. This positioning is consistent with how surfers apply wax—using a firm grip to rub the wax into the board. While the scale is small due to the snow globe, the hand posture and contact point align with real-world behavior. There is no indication of a gap between the wax and the board, supporting the conclusion that direct contact is occurring.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the left hand placed flat on the surfboard, parallel to the board’s surface, providing support?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure’s left hand is resting on the surfboard. The palm appears to be flat against the surface, and the hand is oriented parallel to the board, which is consistent with a stabilizing or supportive gesture during wax application. In real-life surfing preparation, surfers often use one hand to steady the board while applying wax with the other. The position of the left hand in the image supports this functional role. Despite the stylized nature of the figure, the hand placement is anatomically plausible and functionally appropriate.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the surfboard’s surface show a granular, textured pattern consistent with wax application?",
    "explanation": "The surface of the surfboard in Image B appears slightly rough and uneven, with a speckled texture. This texture is consistent with the granular appearance of wax that has been applied to a surfboard. Real surfboards develop such textures when wax is rubbed into the deck, creating a non-slip surface. The lighting within the snow globe enhances the visibility of these small irregularities, reinforcing the impression of waxed texture. While the resolution is limited, the visual cues strongly suggest that the surface has been treated with wax.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the figure positioned in a crouched, forward-leaning posture with knees bent and upper body angled over the surfboard?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is seated on the sand inside the snow globe with its knees bent and body leaning forward over the surfboard. The posture reflects a crouched stance, with the torso angled downward toward the board, which is typical when applying wax. This position allows for better control and precision during waxing. The figure’s limbs and body alignment support this interpretation, even though the character is stylized. The pose is consistent with the physical demands of waxing a surfboard, where balance and reach are important.",
    "answer": "Yes"
