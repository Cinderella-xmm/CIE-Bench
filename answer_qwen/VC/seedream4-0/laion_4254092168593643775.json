      "question": "Is the number \"7\" clearly visible on both the front fender and side panel of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is partially obscured by a large black can labeled 'RaceFuel,' which dominates the foreground. The visible portion of the motorcycle shows part of the front fender and side panel, but the number '7' is not clearly visible on either section due to the obstruction and angle. The number might be present in the original image (Image A), but in this edited version, it is largely hidden behind the can. Based on visual analysis, the number '7' is not clearly visible on both areas in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the track outline labeled \"5/5\" present in the upper-right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper-right corner features a small track outline with the label '5/5.' This element appears to be a digital overlay or graphic element placed on the image. It is consistent with the style seen in racing games or promotional materials where lap progress is indicated. The presence of this label suggests that the image is designed to convey a sense of race progression. The track outline is clearly visible and positioned in the upper-right corner, matching the description.",

      "question": "Does the dust trail originate directly from the rear wheel of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dust trail appears to be swirling dramatically around the motorcycle, particularly near the rear wheel area. However, due to the artistic rendering and the presence of the large can in the foreground, the exact origin point of the dust trail is ambiguous. In realistic scenarios, a dust trail from a dirt bike typically originates from the rear wheel as it accelerates or turns. While the trail seems to emanate from near the rear wheel, the stylized nature of the image makes it difficult to confirm precise causality. Nonetheless, based on typical physics and visual cues in motocross imagery, it is reasonable to infer that the dust trail originates from the rear wheel, even if not perfectly clear.",

      "question": "Is the rider depicted in a forward-leaning posture with hands gripping the handlebars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rider is mostly obscured by the 'RaceFuel' can, which covers much of the rider’s body. Only a partial silhouette of the rider is visible, showing a figure leaning forward on the motorcycle. The posture appears consistent with a forward-leaning position typical during high-speed riding. Although the hands are not clearly visible due to the can's placement, the overall body language suggests that the rider is gripping the handlebars. Given the context of motocross racing, such a posture is standard for maintaining balance and control at speed. Therefore, despite limited visibility, the rider's posture aligns with the described behavior.",

      "question": "Is the front wheel circular with a blue rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front wheel of the motorcycle is partially visible beneath the 'RaceFuel' can. Despite the obstruction, the wheel appears circular, which is expected for any standard motorcycle. The rim has a distinct blue coloration, which matches the design elements seen in the original image (Image A). Blue rims are common in motocross bikes for aesthetic and brand identification purposes. The visible portion of the wheel confirms its circular shape and blue rim, consistent with the description.",

      "question": "Is the rider positioned in the foreground with the desert landscape behind them and the track outline in the upper-right corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rider is not fully visible in the foreground due to the large 'RaceFuel' can that dominates the central portion of the image. The can obscures most of the rider, making it unclear whether the rider is truly in the foreground. However, the background clearly depicts a desert landscape with sand dunes and a racetrack marked by red-and-white curbs. The track outline labeled '5/5' is indeed located in the upper-right corner, as noted earlier. While the rider is not prominently positioned in the foreground due to the can, the composition still includes the desert landscape and track outline as described. Thus, the spatial arrangement of the background elements matches the description, but the rider’s position is compromised by the can.",
