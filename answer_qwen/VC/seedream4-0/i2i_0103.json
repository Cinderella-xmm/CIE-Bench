      "question": "Is the central positioning and rectangular shape of the light blue sofa retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light blue sofa is still centrally positioned in the frame, maintaining its rectangular shape. The visual cues show that the sofa's structure, including its two seat cushions and backrest pillows, remains consistent with a standard rectangular form. The sofa appears to be placed symmetrically between the plant on the left and the lamp on the right, indicating central alignment. Although the entire image has been stylized with a painterly effect reminiscent of Van Gogh’s brushwork, the underlying spatial arrangement and proportions of the sofa are preserved. This suggests that despite the artistic transformation, the core structural elements—positioning and shape—are retained.",

      "question": "Is the framed landscape painting above the sofa still present in its original rectangular proportions and central alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The framed landscape painting above the sofa is still present in Image B. It maintains its rectangular proportions and appears to be centered above the sofa, just as in the original image. The painting's content—featuring an orange sky, mountains, and a river—is recognizable, albeit rendered in a swirling, expressive style similar to Van Gogh’s technique. Despite this stylistic change, the frame's outline remains intact, and the painting is aligned vertically with the center of the sofa. This indicates that while the artistic rendering has changed, the object’s position and basic shape have not been altered.",

      "question": "Are the large green leaves of the plant on the left side of the sofa preserved in terms of shape and location?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plant on the left side of the sofa retains its general shape and location in Image B. The large green leaves are still visible, extending upward and outward from the pot, positioned to the left of the sofa. Although the leaves are now depicted with thick, textured brushstrokes typical of impressionistic art, their overall silhouette and placement relative to the sofa remain consistent with the original. The plant is still in a blue pot and occupies the same spatial area, suggesting that its shape and location have been preserved even under the artistic transformation.",

      "question": "Is the blue-based lamp with the white shade positioned on the table to the right of the sofa preserved in terms of shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lamp on the right side of the sofa is still present and positioned on the small wooden table. Its basic shape—a blue base with a white lampshade—is preserved, though stylized with swirling brushstrokes. The lamp remains on the same side of the room, at the same height and distance from the sofa, indicating that its position has not changed. The wooden table beneath it also maintains its shape and location. While the details are exaggerated by the artistic filter, the overall configuration and spatial relationship between the lamp and the sofa remain consistent with the original setup.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The light-colored rug beneath the sofa is still visible in Image B. It appears as a textured, light-toned area directly in front of the sofa, stretching horizontally across the floor. Although the rug’s edges are softened and blended into the surrounding floor due to the painterly style, its presence and approximate size are consistent with the original image. The rug serves as a grounding element in the composition, and its placement under the sofa remains unchanged. Therefore, despite the artistic treatment, the rug is retained in both location and function.",
