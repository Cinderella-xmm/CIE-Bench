    "Question": "Q1: Is the girl depicted in a posture that suggests she is interacting with the skateboard?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is shown standing on a skateboard with both feet placed on it, and her body is slightly bent forward, indicating balance and engagement with the board. Her arms are positioned for stability, which is typical when someone is learning to skate or maintaining balance. This posture strongly suggests active interaction with the skateboard. The visual cues—such as foot placement, body angle, and arm positioning—are consistent with someone actively using a skateboard. Based on common knowledge of skateboarding, this stance reflects an intentional interaction with the board.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the man depicted in a posture that suggests he is interacting with the skateboard?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man is standing close to the skateboard, with one foot placed on it and his body leaning forward. His posture indicates he is either about to step onto the board or is balancing on it. The position of his legs and the orientation of his body suggest active engagement with the skateboard. In real-world skateboarding contexts, such a stance implies interaction, whether for riding or demonstrating control. Therefore, based on the visual cues and general understanding of skateboarding behavior, the man's posture suggests interaction with the skateboard.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the girl and the man positioned next to each other, leaning against the railing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the girl and the man are positioned near the railing, but only the girl is leaning against it with her hands resting on the rail. The man is standing upright and appears to be focused on the skateboard, not leaning on the railing. While they are close to each other, their physical interactions with the railing differ. The girl is clearly leaning, but the man is not. Thus, although they are adjacent, they are not both leaning against the railing.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are both skateboards visible in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, two skateboards are present: one under the girl’s feet and another under the man’s foot. Both boards are clearly depicted with distinct colors (orange and red) and wheels. They are fully visible and positioned in the foreground, making them easily identifiable. There is no obstruction or occlusion that hides either skateboard. Therefore, based on visual inspection, both skateboards are visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the general shape and placement of the tent preserved in the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tent in the background retains its triangular peak and blue-and-white color scheme, similar to what is seen in real-life tents at outdoor events. Its placement behind the railing and relative to the figures remains consistent with typical spatial arrangements in such scenes. Although the style is simplified and stylized due to the illustration format, the overall shape and position of the tent are preserved compared to real-world expectations. The key structural features—such as the apex and side panels—are recognizable, confirming that the general shape and placement are maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
