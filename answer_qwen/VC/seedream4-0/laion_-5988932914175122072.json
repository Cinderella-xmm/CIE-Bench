      "question": "Is the circular gold-tone MK logo charm present and clearly visible on the model’s attire or accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model is wearing a sleek black dress with a prominent gold-tone circular charm featuring the 'MK' logo attached to the waist area. This charm is clearly visible and matches the iconic branding element commonly found on Michael Kors products. The placement and design of the charm are consistent with the brand's signature aesthetic, where such logos are often used as decorative hardware. Based on visual inspection, the charm is present and clearly displayed on the outfit.",

      "question": "Is the \"MICHAEL KORS\" brand name visible in gold uppercase letters near the upper right area of the model’s attire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no visible text reading 'MICHAEL KORS' in gold uppercase letters on the model’s dress or any accessory. The dress features a minimalist design with only the circular MK logo charm and gold jewelry. In contrast, Image A shows the 'MICHAEL KORS' brand name in gold lettering on the upper front of the bag. Since this specific textual branding is absent from the model’s attire in Image B, it cannot be confirmed as present.",

      "question": "Does the model’s dress feature a black pebbled texture resembling the original bag’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model’s dress in Image B appears to be made of a smooth, glossy black material that resembles leather or patent fabric. It has a reflective sheen and lacks the textured, pebbled surface seen on the bag in Image A. The bag in Image A clearly exhibits a pebbled leather finish, which is characteristic of many Michael Kors handbags. In contrast, the dress in Image B has a sleek, polished look, indicating a different material and texture. Therefore, the dress does not replicate the pebbled texture of the original bag.",

      "question": "Are gold-tone hardware elements (such as buckles, zippers, or clasps) visibly incorporated into the model’s accessories or outfit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model is adorned with multiple gold-tone accessories, including a chunky chain necklace, earrings, bracelets, and a large circular MK logo charm at the waist. These items are clearly gold-toned and serve as prominent hardware elements. While the dress itself does not show visible zippers or buckles, the accessories include metallic components typical of luxury fashion branding. The use of gold-tone metal in jewelry and charms aligns with Michael Kors’ signature style, where such elements are frequently integrated into both clothing and accessories.",

      "question": "Is a zippered pocket with a gold-tone pull visible on the side of the model’s dress or outfit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A careful examination of Image B reveals no visible zippered pocket or zipper pull on the model’s dress. The dress has a smooth silhouette without any external zippers or functional pockets. In contrast, Image A shows a zippered pocket on the side of the bag with a gold-tone zipper pull, which is a distinctive feature of the handbag design. Since there is no such detail on the model’s attire, the presence of a zippered pocket with a gold-tone pull cannot be confirmed.",

      "question": "Are the curved handle shapes reflected in the model’s arm or posture alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model in Image B is walking down the runway with arms positioned naturally—one hand on her hip and the other relaxed by her side. Her posture does not mimic the curved shape of the bag handles seen in Image A. The handles of the bag in Image A are distinctly curved and arched, but there is no indication that the model’s arms or body position are designed to reflect this shape. The alignment of her limbs is more about fashion modeling poise than replicating the form of a handbag handle. Therefore, the curved handle shapes are not mirrored in her posture.",
