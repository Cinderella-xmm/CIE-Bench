      "question": "Is the child depicted with curly brown hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child's hair is clearly visible and exhibits a wavy, curly texture. The color is a warm shade of brown, consistent with typical depictions of curly brown hair in illustrative art. This conclusion is drawn from direct visual observation of the hair's texture and coloration, which aligns with common representations of such features in children’s illustrations. There are no visual cues suggesting otherwise, such as straightness or different coloring.",

      "question": "Is the child’s right hand visibly holding a cluster of balloons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child’s right hand is raised and grasping the strings of a large cluster of colorful balloons. The hand is positioned at the base of the balloon strings, indicating active holding. The positioning and tension in the strings suggest that the child is supporting the weight of the balloons. This is consistent with typical depictions of children holding balloons in illustrations.",

      "question": "Is there a single red balloon floating away on a string toward the upper right of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a single red balloon is visible in the upper right portion of the image, detached from the main cluster. It is connected by a thin string that loops downward, indicating it has floated away. The balloon appears to be drifting upward, consistent with helium-filled balloons escaping. This matches the description of a single red balloon floating away.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child is wearing a bright yellow raincoat. Two front pockets are clearly visible on either side of the coat, each with a flap. Additionally, three dark-colored buttons are visible down the front center of the coat. These details match the description of a yellow raincoat with two front pockets and black buttons. The style is consistent with classic children’s raincoats depicted in illustrations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child’s feet are clad in blue boots that have a reflective, glossy surface, indicative of rubber material. The boots are tall, reaching up to mid-calf, and their shine suggests they are made of a waterproof material like rubber. This is consistent with the appearance of shiny blue rubber boots commonly worn in rainy conditions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child is positioned in a field where tall, golden stalks with pointed tips are visible all around. These stalks resemble mature wheat, and their height exceeds the child’s waist, indicating a dense field. The color is golden-yellow, typical of ripe wheat. This visual evidence supports the conclusion that the child is standing in a field of tall golden wheat stalks.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child’s head is clearly tilted upward, and the eyes are directed toward the single red balloon floating in the upper right. The facial expression includes an open mouth and raised cheeks, indicating a joyful smile. This posture and expression suggest delight and attention toward the floating balloon, consistent with the described scenario.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky occupies the upper portion of the image and is predominantly light blue with scattered white, fluffy clouds. The cloud formations are soft and dispersed, typical of a clear day. This visual information confirms that the background consists of a blue sky with white clouds, matching the description.",

      "question": "Are pink leggings visible beneath the yellow raincoat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the yellow raincoat, the child is wearing red leggings. The color is clearly reddish-pink, and the leggings are visible from the knee down to the top of the boots. While the term 'pink' may be interpreted broadly, the leggings appear more accurately as red or magenta rather than light pink. However, given the context and possible artistic interpretation, the color could be considered within a pink-red spectrum. Therefore, based on the visual cue, the leggings are not distinctly pink but rather a deeper red tone. Hence, the answer should reflect this nuance.",
