      "question": "Is the girl’s long dark hair with bangs present and extending past her shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl has long, dark hair that is styled straight and extends well past her shoulders. The hair features a distinct fringe or bangs across the forehead, which are clearly visible. This style is consistent with typical depictions of long hair in both realistic and stylized art forms. The visual cues—such as the length and direction of the hair strands—confirm that it reaches below the shoulder line. Additionally, the layered appearance of the hair suggests depth and volume, reinforcing the impression of length. Based on these observations, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Does the blouse have visible lace trim along the cuffs and collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blouse worn by the girl features intricate detailing at the cuffs and collar. These areas display delicate, cut-out patterns characteristic of lacework, particularly resembling traditional lace designs such as doily or filigree patterns. The edges of the sleeves and neckline show layered, perforated textures that mimic lace, even though the medium appears to be paper-based. Given that the artwork is rendered in a paper-cut style, the 'lace' is represented through geometric precision rather than fabric texture, but the visual intent aligns with lace trim. Thus, the presence of lace-like trim is evident.",

      "question": "Is the girl wearing a black pleated skirt that extends below the waistline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is wearing a black skirt that is clearly pleated, with vertical folds running from the waist down. The skirt extends below the waistline and reaches approximately mid-thigh, consistent with a standard school-style or formal dress design. The pleats are evenly spaced and structured, indicating a deliberate fashion choice. The material appears stiff, which enhances the pleated effect, typical of formal or semi-formal attire. Therefore, based on visual evidence, the skirt meets the description.",

      "question": "Is the violin positioned under the girl’s chin with her left hand on the neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin is held in a classical playing position: it rests under the girl's chin, supported by her jaw and shoulder. Her left hand is placed on the neck of the violin, near the tuning pegs, which is the correct placement for finger positioning during play. The right hand holds the bow, although not fully visible, its orientation suggests active use. This posture aligns with standard violin technique. The depiction is anatomically accurate within the stylized context of the artwork.",

      "question": "Is there an arched window behind the girl emitting soft, diffused light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a flat, textured beige surface with no indication of a window or any architectural feature like an arch. Instead, the lighting appears uniform and ambient, without directional shadows or highlights that would suggest natural light from a window. In contrast, Image A shows a clear arched window with soft light emanating from it, creating a glow around the girl. However, in Image B, this element is absent—replaced by a plain backdrop with musical notes. Therefore, the arched window is not present in Image B.",

      "question": "Is there a golden candlestick with a bundle of reeds or quills on a wooden table to the right of the girl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, to the right of the girl, there is a small wooden table or stand upon which sits a golden candlestick. On top of the candlestick is a bundle of thin, pointed objects that resemble reeds or quills, arranged upright. This object matches the description given in the question. The materials appear stylized—consistent with the paper-art aesthetic—but the form and arrangement are clearly identifiable as a candlestick with quills. This detail is preserved from Image A, adapted into the same artistic style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl’s head is tilted slightly downward, and her gaze is directed toward the violin, suggesting concentration. Her facial features—especially the closed mouth and gently lowered eyelids—convey a serene and attentive demeanor. Although the style is stylized and lacks fine facial details, the overall composition implies focus and emotional stillness. This expression is consistent with someone deeply engaged in playing music. Hence, the description of a calm and focused expression is accurate.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blouse features detailed, geometric cut-outs along the cuffs and collar that resemble lace patterns. These patterns include symmetrical, interlocking shapes and openwork designs typical of lace, albeit rendered in a two-dimensional, paper-cut style. While not actual textile lace, the visual representation strongly mimics lace through intricate layering and negative space. The design is consistent across both the collar and sleeve cuffs, confirming their presence. Therefore, the lace-like patterns are clearly visible.",
