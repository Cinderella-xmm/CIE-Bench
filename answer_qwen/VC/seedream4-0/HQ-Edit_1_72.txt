    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the original subject’s facial features, including the shape of the nose, lips, eyes, and skin tone?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's facial features are clearly visible and consistent with those in the original image. The nose is broad and well-defined, the lips are full and proportionate, the eyes are almond-shaped with a direct gaze, and the skin tone remains dark and uniform. These features are rendered with high fidelity, suggesting that the editing process preserved the core identity of the subject. While the artistic style has shifted to a more painterly or textured aesthetic, the proportions and characteristics of the face have not been altered significantly. This indicates that the edit focused on stylistic transformation rather than morphological change.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the central V-neck pattern with diamond motifs clearly visible on the Dashiki in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "The central V-neck design of the Dashiki in Image B is prominently displayed and retains its intricate geometric structure. The diamond motifs are clearly visible within the vertical band of the neckline, though they appear slightly stylized due to the painting-like texture applied to the image. Despite the artistic filter, the pattern remains distinct and recognizable as part of traditional African textile design. The use of gold accents enhances the visibility of these motifs, reinforcing their presence even under the altered visual treatment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the tassels at the bottom hem of the Dashiki still present and positioned at the same location as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tassels at the bottom hem of the Dashiki are indeed present. They are located at the lower edge of the garment, symmetrically aligned on both sides, just as in the original image. Although the texture of the image gives them a slightly less defined appearance due to the painted effect, their position and number remain consistent with the original. This suggests that while the overall style was modified, specific details like the tassels were preserved for authenticity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the hands positioned in front of the body, clasped together at waist level, as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "The hands in Image B are positioned directly in front of the subject’s body, with fingers interlocked and palms touching, forming a clasped gesture at approximately waist level. This posture matches exactly the hand placement seen in the original image. The pose conveys a sense of calmness and dignity, which is maintained through the edit. Even with the stylized rendering, the spatial relationship between the hands and torso remains unchanged, indicating careful preservation of the subject’s stance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there tall, golden-colored grass in the foreground surrounding the subject’s lower body?",
    "explanation": "Yes, in Image B, the foreground features tall grass that is predominantly golden in color, consistent with the savanna landscape depicted in the original image. The grass blades are stylized but still clearly represent the same type of vegetation—tall, dry, and swaying gently. The texture of the grass appears more pronounced due to the painterly effect, but its height, color, and positioning around the subject’s lower body remain faithful to the original composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there acacia trees with flat-topped canopies visible in the background behind the subject?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes several trees with characteristic flat-topped canopies, typical of acacia species found in African savannas. These trees are spaced across the horizon, maintaining the depth and environmental context established in the original image. Their silhouettes are distinct despite the textured overlay, and their placement contributes to the sense of an open, natural landscape. The visual cues confirm that the key elements of the environment—specifically the acacia trees—are preserved in the edited version.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the subject’s hair retain its short, curly, and voluminous texture as seen in the original image?",
    "explanation": "The subject’s hair in Image B maintains the short, curly, and voluminous texture observed in the original image. The curls are defined and dense, particularly at the crown, giving the hairstyle a rounded, full appearance. Although the artistic rendering adds a slightly smoother finish due to the painting style, the overall structure and volume of the hair remain intact. There is no indication of flattening or elongation, and the silhouette of the hairstyle is consistent with the original depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the subject centrally positioned in the frame, facing forward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is clearly centered within the frame and faces directly toward the viewer. The composition emphasizes symmetry, with equal spacing between the subject and the edges of the image. The subject’s shoulders are level, and the head is upright, reinforcing the frontal orientation. The background elements are balanced on either side, further supporting the central alignment. This compositional choice aligns perfectly with the original image, where the subject was also placed centrally and facing forward.",
    "answer": "Yes"
