      "question": "Are there exactly four wooden trays arranged in a 2x2 grid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual layout shows four distinct rectangular containers arranged in a 2x2 configuration. Each container has a similar structure and is positioned to form a symmetrical grid. Although the containers are stylized with bold colors and geometric patterns, their arrangement clearly follows a 2x2 layout. The term 'wooden' is misleading here due to the abstract artistic rendering—these are not realistic wood but rather stylized representations that mimic wooden trays. However, based on the number and spatial organization, there are indeed four such units arranged in a 2x2 grid. This conclusion is drawn from the consistent placement and symmetry of the objects, which aligns with the typical presentation of food trays in a buffet setting.",

      "question": "Do the madeleines retain their distinctive shell-shaped form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pastries in the bottom-right tray of Image B are depicted with rounded, slightly elongated forms that resemble shells, consistent with the traditional shape of madeleines. Despite the stylized, abstract art style using flat colors and sharp edges, the overall silhouette and contour of each pastry maintain the characteristic shell-like curve. In real-world baking, madeleines are known for their scalloped, seashell appearance due to the mold used during baking. The edited image preserves this essential feature through simplified shapes, indicating that the artist intended to represent madeleines accurately, even if in a non-realistic manner. Therefore, the distinctive shell-shaped form is retained.",

      "question": "Is the label reading \"Madeleine\" positioned near the tray containing shell-shaped pastries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom-right tray contains pastries shaped like shells, which are associated with madeleines. A black label with white text is visible next to this tray, and although the text is stylized, it appears to read 'Madeleine'. The positioning of the label directly adjacent to the tray with shell-shaped pastries indicates an intentional pairing. This labeling convention is common in bakeries or buffets to identify food items. Based on both visual placement and contextual knowledge (that madeleines are shell-shaped), the label is correctly placed near the appropriate tray. Even though the font and design are abstract, the association remains clear.",

      "question": "Is the word \"craster\" visibly engraved on the front of each of the four trays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each of the four trays in Image B displays the word 'craster' on its front panel. The text is rendered in a consistent style across all trays, appearing in lowercase letters within a horizontal line or border. While the background and surrounding elements are highly stylized with geometric patterns and vibrant colors, the text 'craster' remains legible and centrally located on each tray’s front face. This repetition suggests branding or identification, possibly referencing a manufacturer or brand name. Given that the same label appears on all four trays and is clearly distinguishable despite the artistic abstraction, the answer is affirmative.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each tray contains a light-colored, folded sheet beneath the pastries. These sheets have angular folds and a beige or cream color, consistent with the appearance of parchment paper used in baking and food display. In real-world settings, parchment paper is commonly used to prevent sticking and aid in cleanup. The presence of such material in each tray—top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right—is visually confirmed by the triangular or V-shaped folds at the corners. The stylized rendering does not obscure this detail; instead, it emphasizes the layered structure. Thus, parchment paper is represented in all four trays.",

      "question": "Do the pastries in the top-right tray retain their oval, slightly flattened shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pastries in the top-right tray of Image B are illustrated as circular, slightly flattened ovals with a textured surface resembling baked goods. Their shape is consistent with that of gallette bretonne, a type of French buttery biscuit often oval or round and slightly compressed. The artistic style uses bold outlines and simplified forms, but the core geometry—an oval with a slight flattening—remains intact. Real-world gallettes are typically shortbread-like and have a uniform, flattened profile. The representation in Image B maintains these key characteristics, even if exaggerated or stylized. Therefore, the pastries retain their expected oval, slightly flattened shape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pastries in the bottom-left tray of Image B are depicted as rectangular slices with a porous, speckled interior, resembling sliced loaf bread. The cross-sectional view shows a crumbly texture with small dark spots, indicative of ingredients like raisins or chocolate chips, commonly found in banana bread or chocolate chip loaf. The slices are stacked, and their layered structure is evident, mimicking how loaf bread is typically served. Although the image is abstract and uses flat colors, the shape and internal pattern strongly suggest sliced loaf bread. The visual cues—rectangular form, visible pores, and internal variation—are sufficient to conclude that the pastries are clearly represented as sliced loaf bread with visible internal texture.",
