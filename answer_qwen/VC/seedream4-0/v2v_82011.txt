    "Question": "Q2: Is the standing doll still wearing a light-colored tutu?",
    "explanation": "The standing doll in Image B is illustrated wearing a skirt that matches the description of a tutu—light in color, layered, and flared. While the medium has changed from a photograph to an artistic rendering, the visual attributes of the garment remain consistent with the original: it is pale, possibly peach or cream, and structured like a traditional ballet tutu. The use of shading and line work suggests volume and texture typical of such attire, confirming that the light-colored tutu is preserved.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the seated doll still wear a pink top?",

Although the illustration uses a more muted palette than the photograph, the hue remains within the pink spectrum. The clothing’s shape and placement match the original, suggesting continuity in design.

The background elements, such as the sign and props, further confirm the setting remains unchanged.",
