        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's forehead is visible, and there is a small, dark dot located centrally between the eyebrows, which is characteristic of a bindi. This is a traditional Indian ornament often worn by women, especially during cultural or religious performances. The presence of this dot aligns with common cultural practices and visual cues seen in classical Indian dance depictions. The bindi is clearly visible and positioned correctly on the forehead, indicating its presence.",

      "question": "Does the dancer have dark braided hair secured with decorative pins?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the dancer's hairstyle in Image B, her hair appears to be dark and neatly arranged in a bun at the back of her head. While it is not explicitly shown as a braid, the structure suggests that it may be styled with braids hidden within the bun. However, upon closer inspection, there are no visible braids extending from the sides or back of the head. Instead, the hair is gathered into a tight bun adorned with ornate golden pins and floral decorations. These pins are consistent with traditional Indian dance attire, but the hair itself does not appear to be braided. Therefore, based on the visual evidence, the hair is not braided but rather styled in a bun with decorative elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer has a large, elaborate floral arrangement on the left side of her head (from the viewer’s perspective). This floral piece is composed of cream-colored or off-white flowers, possibly jasmine, which are commonly used in traditional Indian dance costumes. The garland is positioned on the left side of her head, extending from the bun and draping over the ear. Given the cultural context and the visual details, this is indeed a white floral garland. The placement and design match typical adornments seen in classical Indian dance forms like Bharatanatyam.",

      "question": "Is there a golden ornament placed at the crown of the dancer's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the dancer's head in Image B, there is a prominent golden ornament that resembles a small, upright finial or crown-like structure. This ornament is attached to the center of the bun and extends upward, adding height and elegance to the hairstyle. Such ornaments are common in traditional Indian dance costumes, particularly in classical styles where headpieces are used to enhance the aesthetic appeal. The golden color and placement at the crown of the head confirm its identity as a decorative crown-like ornament.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dancer in Image B is depicted in a side profile, with her body oriented toward the right side of the frame. Her face is turned slightly forward, but her body alignment—especially the positioning of her arms, legs, and torso—indicates a clear side profile. She is looking toward the right, and her posture suggests she is performing a classical dance pose that emphasizes lateral movement. This orientation is consistent with many traditional dance poses where dancers are shown in profile to highlight form and expression. Therefore, the dancer is indeed facing to the right in a side profile view.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's right leg is raised, with the knee bent and the foot pointing downward. The leg is lifted high, supported by the left leg, which remains grounded. The foot is clearly angled downward, with the toes extended, which is typical in classical dance poses such as 'arabesque' or 'karni' positions in Indian dance. The elevation and positioning of the leg suggest a dynamic and balanced movement. Based on the visual cues, the right leg is indeed elevated with a bent knee and downward-pointing foot.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dancer in Image B exhibits a poised and balanced posture. Her upper body is upright, with a slight twist in the torso that enhances the fluidity of the pose. The elevated right leg adds dynamism while maintaining balance on the supporting left leg. The arms are gracefully extended, contributing to the overall symmetry and stability of the stance. This combination of an upright spine, controlled torso twist, and elevated leg is characteristic of classical dance techniques designed to convey grace and precision. Therefore, the dancer maintains a balanced, upright posture with a slight torso twist and elevated leg.",
