    "Question": "Q1: Does the character retain the full face mask with geometric designs and pointed ears?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown from behind, standing on a rooftop. Despite the back-facing angle, the silhouette of the head clearly shows the iconic pointed ears characteristic of Black Panther's helmet. The mask appears to be intact, as the shape and structure are consistent with the known design of the full-face mask featuring geometric patterns. These features are visible in the profile view, confirming that the mask retains its signature look. Based on world knowledge of the Black Panther costume, the full face mask with geometric designs and pointed ears is a defining feature, and this image preserves those elements even from a rear perspective.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the suit still covered in the panther-scale texture with black coloring?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the character wearing a suit that is predominantly black, consistent with the traditional color scheme of Black Panther’s attire. The surface of the suit displays a detailed, textured pattern resembling scales, which aligns with the panther-scale motif seen in the original design. This texture is visible across the torso, arms, and legs, indicating that the material has not been altered. Even under the ambient city lighting, the suit maintains its sleek, dark appearance with fine textural details, reinforcing the presence of the panther-scale design. World knowledge confirms that the vibranium suit has a distinctive scale-like texture, and this is preserved in the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the metallic claw-like accents on the shoulders and chest of the suit intact and correctly positioned?",
    "explanation": "From the rear view in Image B, the shoulder area of the suit shows prominent metallic structures that resemble claw-like accents, consistent with the design seen in the original Black Panther suit. These elements are located at the upper back and shoulders, extending outward in a way that matches the known placement of the armor plating. While the chest area is not fully visible from behind, the overall symmetry and continuity of the design suggest that the front accents are also present and properly aligned. World knowledge supports that these metallic components are part of the suit’s aesthetic and functional design, and their positioning in the image remains accurate.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the character maintain a confident stance with arms relaxed downward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is standing upright on a rooftop, facing away from the viewer. His arms are raised, with one hand holding a device (possibly a phone or camera) to take a picture of the robot beside him. This posture is active and engaged rather than relaxed. The arms are not hanging down by his sides but are instead lifted and positioned for interaction. Therefore, the stance is not one of passive confidence with arms relaxed downward. Instead, it reflects a moment of action or observation. Comparing this to typical depictions of Black Panther, who often stands with a poised and composed posture, this scene deviates from that norm due to the specific activity being performed.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the sharp lines and contours of the suit design retained?",
    "explanation": "The suit in Image B displays clear, well-defined edges and angular shapes, particularly around the shoulders, spine, and leg sections. These sharp lines are consistent with the original design of Black Panther’s suit, which emphasizes sleek, dynamic contours. The lighting enhances these features, casting shadows that accentuate the depth and precision of the suit’s construction. Even though the character is viewed from behind, the structural integrity of the design is evident. World knowledge indicates that the suit’s aesthetic relies heavily on clean, sharp lines to convey strength and technological sophistication, and these elements are faithfully preserved in the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
