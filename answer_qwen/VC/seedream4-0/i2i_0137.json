      "question": "Are the two white armchairs with orange cushions still present in the same location as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two white armchairs with orange cushions are clearly visible and positioned symmetrically on either side of a small round table. Their placement relative to the window, rug, and surrounding furniture appears consistent with typical interior design layouts where seating is arranged to face each other for conversation. The chairs' orientation, distance from the window, and alignment with the rug suggest they have not been moved. Comparing this to Image A, both images show identical spatial arrangements of the chairs, including their distance from the wall and symmetry around the central table. There are no visual cues such as shadows or perspective shifts indicating movement. Therefore, based on visual consistency and common interior design principles, the chairs remain in the same location.",

      "question": "Is the small round wooden table still present between the two armchairs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a small round table located between the two armchairs. It has a dark metal frame and a wooden top, which matches the description of the 'small round wooden table.' Its position is centered between the chairs, maintaining balance in the room’s layout. This setup is typical in living rooms to facilitate interaction between seated individuals. In Image A, the same table is present but features a black vase with dried flowers. In Image B, the table holds a teapot and cup instead, indicating that while the object itself remains, its contents have changed. However, the presence and location of the table remain unchanged. Thus, based on visual evidence and standard furniture arrangement logic, the table is still present in the same spot.",

      "question": "Is the large window framed by beige curtains still in the same position as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The large window in Image B is centrally located on the back wall, flanked by long beige curtains that hang from a black curtain rod. The window's size, shape (double-hung with four panes), and placement relative to the ceiling and floor match those in Image A. The lighting coming through the window suggests it is facing the same outdoor view—green trees and daylight—which supports that the window has not been repositioned. Additionally, the symmetry of the curtains and the alignment of the window frame with the surrounding architecture confirm its fixed location. Given that windows are permanent fixtures in buildings and the visual context shows no signs of alteration, it is reasonable to conclude the window remains in the same position.",

      "question": "Is the tall indoor plant in a woven basket still located to the right of the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a tall green indoor plant is visible in a woven basket placed on the floor to the right side of the window when viewed from the front. The plant’s height, leaf structure, and pot style are consistent with what would be expected for a decorative houseplant like a rubber tree or similar species. Its position relative to the window and the armchair on the right side remains unchanged compared to Image A. The shadow cast by the plant also aligns with the lighting direction from the window, confirming its stationary placement. Since plants are often kept in fixed locations for aesthetic and environmental reasons, and there is no indication of movement (such as displaced shadows or altered angles), the plant is still in the same location.",

      "question": "Is the beige rug covering the wooden floor still present under the furniture arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large beige area rug is clearly visible beneath the two armchairs and the central table. It covers a significant portion of the herringbone-patterned wooden floor and is centered within the seating arrangement. The rug's texture, color, and dimensions appear consistent with those in Image A. The edges of the rug align with the furniture in both images, and there is no sign of displacement or removal. Rugs are typically placed to anchor furniture groupings and define spaces, so their continued presence is expected unless explicitly removed. Based on visual continuity and interior design norms, the rug remains in place.",
