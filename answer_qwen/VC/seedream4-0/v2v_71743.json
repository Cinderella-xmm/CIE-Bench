      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'NEW YORK Guitar Method' is located at the top of the cover in large, white, sans-serif font against a solid green background. The contrast between the white text and the green background ensures high visibility. The letters are well-spaced and clear, with no visual obstructions such as overlapping graphics or shadows. Based on standard principles of typography and readability, this design choice makes the title highly legible. There are no distortions or blurring effects that would impair reading. Therefore, the text is clearly visible and legible.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The author's name, 'by Bruce Arnold,' appears directly below the main title in a smaller but still readable white font. It is positioned in the upper right portion of the green area, maintaining good contrast against the background. Although it is smaller than the main title, the font is clean and unobstructed, and there are no visual elements (like patterns or images) interfering with its legibility. Given the clarity of the font and the absence of any visual noise around it, the author's name is clearly visible and identifiable.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of the cover, within a dark green rectangular box, the text 'Ensemble Book 2' is displayed in white, capitalized letters. This placement is consistent with typical book labeling conventions for series volumes. The font is bold and clear, and the contrast between the white text and the dark green background enhances readability. The positioning does not overlap with any other graphic elements, ensuring it is easily noticeable. Therefore, the text is present and clearly visible.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In the upper right corner of the cover, beneath the author's name, there is a small black-and-white logo depicting a figure playing a stringed instrument next to a trash can-like structure. Below this image, the words 'MUSE EEK' are written in capital letters. This matches the known branding style of Muse Eek, a publisher known for music education materials. The logo is distinct and legible despite its size, and its placement follows common design practices for publisher logos on educational books. Thus, the 'MUSE EEK' logo is indeed present.",

      "question": "** Is the guitar positioned diagonally across the cover?\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The electric guitar is depicted in a way that spans from the lower left to the upper right of the circular image area. Its neck extends upward and to the right, while the body rests toward the bottom left. This diagonal orientation is consistent with how guitars are often illustrated in dynamic compositions to convey movement and energy. The angle aligns with typical artistic representations where instruments are angled to create visual interest. The guitarâ€™s placement cuts across the circular frame, reinforcing the diagonal composition. Therefore, the guitar is positioned diagonally across the cover.",
