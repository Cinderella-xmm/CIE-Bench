      "question": "Is the blue herringbone-textured jacket retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted as an owl wearing a blue garment that mimics the appearance of a formal jacket. The texture of this garment appears to be feather-like and not herringbone, which is a distinct diagonal pattern typically seen in woven fabrics. While the color is blue, matching the original jacket, the material and texture are fundamentally different due to the anthropomorphic nature of the owl. The herringbone pattern is absent, replaced by feathers arranged in a way that simulates clothing. Therefore, although the color is preserved, the specific herringbone texture is not retained.",

      "question": "Are the collar and lapel shape of the blue jacket preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is wearing a blue garment with a high collar and what appears to be lapels, similar in structure to the original human's jacket. However, the design has been stylized to fit the owl’s anatomy—particularly around the neck and shoulders—so while the general silhouette of a collared jacket is present, the precise shape and proportions of the lapels and collar differ from those on a human figure. The garment's form is adapted to the owl's body, resulting in a less accurate replication of the original jacket’s collar and lapel shape. Thus, the shape is loosely preserved but not faithfully maintained.",

      "question": "Are two microphones visible in front of the speaker in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed two microphones positioned on the podium in front of the owl, mirroring the setup in the original image. They are placed symmetrically, just as they were in Image A, with black gooseneck arms extending toward the speaker. The presence and placement of the microphones are consistent with the original scene, suggesting that this element was intentionally preserved in the edit. This detail supports continuity between the original and edited versions, even though the subject has been transformed.",

      "question": "Is the speaker’s right hand raised with an open palm in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl’s right wing (analogous to the human’s right hand) is raised and displayed with an open claw, mimicking the gesture of an open palm. The positioning and orientation of the limb closely resemble the original human’s gesture, suggesting an intentional preservation of body language. Although it is a bird’s claw rather than a human hand, the gesture is clearly meant to represent the same communicative action. Therefore, despite the transformation, the equivalent gesture is present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the podium features a circular emblem at its center. It has a blue background with a gold border and a pattern of stars, which matches the description of the original emblem. While the details may be slightly stylized or simplified due to the artistic rendering, the core elements—the blue center, gold rim, and star arrangement—are clearly visible and correspond to the emblem in Image A. This suggests that the emblem was intentionally retained to maintain visual consistency with the original setting.",
