      "question": "Does the image retain the Mercedes-Benz grille and logo on the front of the van?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the van clearly displays a prominent grille with the iconic Mercedes-Benz three-pointed star emblem centered within it. The grille design includes horizontal slats and chrome accents, consistent with classic Mercedes-Benz styling cues. This is not only visually recognizable but also aligns with historical designs of vintage Mercedes-Benz vans such as the T2 series, which this vehicle resembles. The presence of the logo and grille structure is unmistakable, indicating that these elements have been preserved in the edited image. Even though the overall style of the van appears retro, the branding components are intact.",

      "question": "Is the overall shape and structure of the van consistent with the original Mercedes-Benz Sprinter design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The van in Image B has a boxy, elongated body with a high roofline and rounded edges, characteristic of older Mercedes-Benz vans like the T2 or T3 models from the 1970s–1980s. However, the original Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (as seen in Image A) is a modern commercial van with a more angular, aerodynamic profile, larger windshield, and distinct front fascia. The van in Image B lacks the modern features such as the sloped hood, integrated headlights, and side mirror placement typical of the Sprinter. Instead, it exhibits a vintage design with separate round headlights, a chrome bumper, and a lower, wider stance. Therefore, while both vehicles are Mercedes-Benz vans, the shape and structure in Image B do not match the contemporary Sprinter design.",

      "question": "Are the wheels placed in the same positions and maintain similar sizes as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels are positioned at the corners of the van, consistent with standard vehicle layout. However, comparing to Image A (the modern Sprinter), the wheel size and design differ significantly. The wheels in Image B feature classic hubcaps with a polished chrome finish and a simpler five-spoke design, whereas the Sprinter in Image A has steel wheels with plastic wheel covers and a more utilitarian appearance. Additionally, the wheel arches in Image B are smaller and less pronounced than those in the Sprinter, suggesting a different suspension setup and overall vehicle proportion. While the wheel placement is anatomically correct for a van, the size and style are distinctly different from the original.",

      "question": "Does the van still have clean lines and no visible side windows on the cargo area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side of the van features multiple rectangular windows along the passenger side, including two large rear-side windows and one mid-section window. These windows are framed with dark trim and appear functional, indicating that they are part of the passenger or living space. In contrast, the original Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (Image A) has a plain cargo side with no side windows—only a single sliding door and a blank panel surface. The presence of multiple windows in Image B suggests that this is a recreational or camper-style van rather than a cargo-focused model. Thus, the clean lines are disrupted by these windows, and the cargo area is not windowless.",

      "question": "Does the van retain the large windshield with the same dimensions as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The windshield in Image B is significantly smaller and more upright compared to the large, curved windshield seen in the original Sprinter (Image A). The Sprinter's windshield extends almost vertically from the base of the hood and spans a wide width, contributing to its modern, spacious cabin feel. In contrast, the van in Image B has a narrower, more compact windshield with a sharper angle, typical of vintage designs. This difference reflects changes in aerodynamics and interior design philosophy over time. Therefore, the windshield in Image B does not match the dimensions or proportions of the original Sprinter.",
