    "Question": "Q1: Is the basketball present and being held in the player’s right hand?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the player is depicted in a dynamic dribbling pose. The basketball is clearly visible and positioned near the player's right hand, which is gripping it. The hand placement and orientation of the ball suggest active control, consistent with dribbling. Based on visual cues such as the positioning of the fingers and the angle of the ball relative to the hand, it can be concluded that the player is holding the basketball with their right hand. This observation aligns with standard basketball mechanics where players typically use one hand to dribble while moving. There is no indication of the ball being held by the left hand or floating freely.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the player in a low crouch with the right leg bent and the left leg extended backward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the player's posture shows a low stance typical of a basketball dribbling motion. The right leg is bent at the knee, indicating weight distribution and balance during movement. The left leg is extended backward, which is characteristic of a forward-leaning, agile stance used in dribbling. This posture allows for quick directional changes and maintains momentum. Visual analysis confirms the bent right leg and extended left leg, consistent with athletic movement. Comparing this to real-world basketball dynamics, this stance is standard for maintaining balance while dribbling. Therefore, the description matches the visual evidence.",
