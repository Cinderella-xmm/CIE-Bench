      "question": "Does the refrigerator retain its clear glass shelves with the same arrangement as the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the refrigerator's interior is clearly visible, showing multiple transparent shelves that appear to be made of glass. These shelves are arranged in a vertical stack, with consistent spacing and alignment similar to typical modern refrigerators. The number and positioning of the shelves—five main horizontal shelves plus a crisper drawer at the bottom—match what would be expected from a standard design. Comparing this to common refrigerator layouts and the visual consistency between both images, there is no indication of any change in shelf material or arrangement. The glass shelves remain intact and unaltered in structure and placement. This conclusion is supported by world knowledge about refrigerator design, where such shelving is standard for visibility and ease of access.",

      "question": "Are the specific food items (like fruits, bottles, and jars) present in their original positions within the refrigerator?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the placement of food items appears largely unchanged compared to the original image. For instance, the green bottle on the top shelf, the yellow jar on the second shelf, and the bowl of strawberries are all positioned identically. Similarly, the bottles on the door shelves maintain their relative order and orientation. The fruit in the crisper drawer—such as oranges, apples, and herbs—are also placed in the same configuration. Based on visual cues and common sense regarding object permanence and minimal editing, it is reasonable to conclude that these items have not been moved or rearranged. Any changes would likely be noticeable due to shifts in lighting or shadows, but none are evident here. Therefore, the food items remain in their original positions.",

      "question": "Is the countertop with the fruit bowl and plant placed adjacent to the refrigerator, as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left side of the frame shows a white cabinet with a wooden countertop. On this countertop, there is a brown bowl containing various fruits (including an apple and a plum) and a tall white vase holding a green plant. This setup matches exactly what is seen in the original image. The spatial relationship between the countertop and the refrigerator remains consistent—both are side by side, with the countertop to the left of the fridge. There is no evidence of repositioning or removal of these elements. Using world knowledge about kitchen layouts, such configurations are typical for maximizing counter space next to appliances like refrigerators. Thus, the countertop and its contents are still placed adjacent to the refrigerator.",

      "question": "Does the background maintain the same clean, light-colored kitchen design, including the wall tiles and window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a kitchen with light-colored walls, white subway tiles on the backsplash, and a large window on the right side allowing natural light to enter. These elements are consistent with the original image. The color scheme remains neutral, dominated by whites and soft grays, contributing to a clean aesthetic. The window has a white frame and offers a view of greenery outside, which aligns with the original setting. No changes in tile pattern, wall color, or window placement are observed. Based on architectural and interior design norms, such details are typically preserved unless explicitly altered. Since no visual discrepancies are present, the background retains its original appearance.",

      "question": "Apart from the specified logo replacement and custom label, are there no additional alterations to the appearance of the refrigerator?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two notable changes are visible: the top of the refrigerator now displays 'User's Name' instead of a brand logo, and one of the door shelves has a custom label reading 'Xu's Fresh Zone.' These modifications are intentional and match the described edits. However, upon closer inspection, no other changes are apparent. The refrigerator’s exterior color, shape, handle, and internal layout—including shelf placement, lighting, and item arrangement—remain identical to the original. There are no signs of added stickers, dents, or structural modifications. Given that only the text labels were changed, and no other visual differences exist, it can be concluded that no additional alterations were made beyond the specified ones. This assessment relies on careful observation and understanding that minor textual edits do not affect overall appearance unless otherwise indicated.",
