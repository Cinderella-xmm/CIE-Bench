    "Question": "Q1: Is the American flag patch present on the right shoulder of the astronaut?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is depicted in a stylized, cartoon-like illustration. Observing the right shoulder (from the viewer's perspective), there is a patch that matches the design of the American flag—red and white stripes with a blue field containing white stars. This placement and design are consistent with standard NASA space suits, where the U.S. flag is typically displayed on the right shoulder. The visual cues confirm the presence of the flag patch.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the blue NASA insignia patch visible on the left shoulder of the astronaut?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut’s left shoulder (from the viewer's perspective) displays a circular blue patch with white elements, which resembles the NASA 'meatball' insignia. While it is simplified due to the cartoon style, the shape, color scheme, and placement align with the typical NASA insignia found on astronaut suits. This is consistent with real-world NASA suit design, where the NASA logo is often placed on the left shoulder. Therefore, based on visual evidence and world knowledge, the patch is identifiable as the NASA insignia.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is Earth visible in the reflection within the astronaut’s helmet visor, appearing above the lunar horizon?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet visor reflects a dark interior with no discernible reflection of Earth. Instead, the visor appears black or dark, with no visible planetary reflection. In contrast, in realistic depictions (such as Image A), Earth often appears reflected in the visor when the astronaut is on the Moon. However, in this stylized version, the artist has not included such a reflection. Therefore, based on visual inspection, Earth is not visible in the visor.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the International Space Station visible in the background with its solar panels and modular structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a large structure resembling the International Space Station (ISS) is visible in the upper right portion of the image. It features multiple cylindrical modules connected by trusses and large solar panel arrays extending outward. These visual elements match the known configuration of the ISS. Although the depiction is simplified for artistic purposes, the key components—modular segments and solar panels—are clearly represented. Thus, the ISS is recognizable in the background.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the ground beneath the astronaut visibly cratered and gray, consistent with the Moon’s surface?",
    "explanation": "The ground beneath the astronaut in Image B is rendered in shades of light gray with several circular indentations of varying sizes, resembling craters. These features are consistent with the appearance of the lunar surface as observed in photographs from Apollo missions and lunar orbiters. The texture and coloration are simplified but still convey the characteristic look of the Moon's terrain. Therefore, the ground is visually consistent with the Moon’s surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the astronaut facing forward with both side lights on the helmet illuminated?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is positioned facing directly toward the viewer, indicating a forward-facing orientation. On either side of the helmet, there are two small rectangular lights that are glowing blue, suggesting they are illuminated. These lights are consistent with the headlamp or camera lights found on modern space suits. Their illumination is clearly depicted in the image, even though the style is cartoonish. Thus, both side lights appear to be on.",
    "answer": "Yes"
