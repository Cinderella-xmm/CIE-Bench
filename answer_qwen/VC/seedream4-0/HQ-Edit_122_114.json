      "question": "Is the window located at the top center of the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window is positioned at the upper central part of the house's facade, directly beneath the peak of the roof. It is centered horizontally and appears to be a small, rectangular window with a grid pattern typical of traditional wooden houses. This placement aligns with common architectural design where windows are placed symmetrically in the gable end of an A-frame structure. The visual cues confirm its location at the top center, consistent with both aesthetic balance and functional ventilation in such buildings.",

      "question": "Is the chimney positioned on the left side of the roof?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chimney is clearly visible on the left side of the roof, extending vertically from the gable end. Its brick construction and capping suggest it is a functional or decorative element typical of rural or rustic architecture. The chimney's position on the left side (from the viewer’s perspective) is consistent with asymmetrical design choices often seen in handcrafted or whimsical structures. There is no indication that it has been moved or altered from its original placement relative to the house’s symmetry.",

      "question": "Does the house have an A-frame roof with a pointed peak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The house in Image B exhibits a distinct A-frame roof structure, characterized by two sloping sides that meet at a sharp, pointed peak at the top. This architectural style is commonly used in cabins and rustic dwellings for its structural stability and snow-shedding properties. The roof’s triangular shape, supported by visible wooden beams and shingles, confirms the A-frame design. The presence of a chimney and window within this triangular space further supports this conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a large circular opening in the front of the house where the nest is located?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the house features a large, circular-shaped opening that serves as a cavity for the nest. This opening is framed by wooden planks and filled with a detailed bird’s nest made of twigs. While not a traditional door or window, it functions as a central feature resembling a natural nesting site integrated into the structure. The circular shape is emphasized by the arrangement of gears and mechanical elements around it, suggesting intentional design rather than a random gap. This indicates a deliberate architectural choice to incorporate the nest as a focal point.",

      "question": "Is the stork located inside the nest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stork is positioned within the large nest that occupies the circular opening of the house. The bird is centrally placed, with its body resting among the twigs, and its legs standing firmly on the nest's base. Although the stork is mechanical in design (steampunk-style), its placement within the nest structure is clear. The surrounding gears and pipes do not obscure the fact that the stork is contained within the nest, confirming its location inside.",

      "question": "Are there yellow flowers and a path visible in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground includes patches of green grass interspersed with small yellow flowers, which resemble dandelions or buttercups. These flowers are scattered near the base of the house and along the edge of a light-colored gravel or stone path that curves from the bottom right toward the center. The presence of both floral elements and a defined path suggests a natural, pastoral setting. This detail adds depth and context to the scene, reinforcing the contrast between the organic and mechanical elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features tall green trees on the left side, partially obscured by the house but clearly visible with their leafy canopies. On the right side, the sky is depicted with a subtle texture, resembling a stippled or dot-matrix pattern, giving it a painterly or illustrated quality. This textured sky contrasts with the more realistic rendering of the house and stork, possibly indicating an artistic or surreal style. Together, the greenery and sky provide a natural backdrop that enhances the whimsical tone of the image.",
