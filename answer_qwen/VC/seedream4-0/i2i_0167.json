      "question": "Does the apple retain its glossy red skin with visible white specks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both views of the apple — the whole apple and the half-cut apple — show a vibrant red skin that reflects light, indicating a glossy surface. The presence of small white specks, typical of certain apple varieties like Red Delicious or Fuji, is clearly visible across the skin in both views. This observation aligns with real-world knowledge that many red apples have such speckled textures due to natural pigmentation patterns. The lighting enhances these features, making them distinct. Therefore, based on visual evidence and common apple characteristics, the apple retains its glossy red skin with visible white specks.",

      "question": "Is the short dried stem still present on the apple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both views of Image B, the stem is visible and appears short and dried, consistent with how apple stems look after being picked. In the whole apple view, the stem is centered at the top, and in the halved apple view, it remains attached to the cut side, extending upward. The stem's dry texture and brown coloration are typical of naturally aged apple stems. There is no indication of damage or removal. Thus, based on visual inspection and biological knowledge of apples, the stem is still present.",

      "question": "Is the apple displayed on a wooden surface in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the whole apple and the halved apple in Image B rest on a surface that exhibits wood grain patterns, warm golden-brown tones, and subtle reflections consistent with polished wooden surfaces. The shadows cast by the apple also align with the texture and angle of a flat wooden table. There is no variation in the background or surface material between the two views. This consistency, combined with common knowledge that apples are often placed on wooden tables for display, supports the conclusion that the apple is displayed on a wooden surface in all views.",

      "question": "Does the apple keep its realistic overall shape and volume in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the whole apple view, the fruit maintains a round, slightly flattened spherical shape typical of most apples, with smooth contours and natural curvature. In the cross-section view, the halved apple shows a symmetrical interior with a central core and seeds, maintaining proportional thickness and depth that reflect realistic internal anatomy. The cut surface reveals a clean, even division without distortion, and the outer skin curves naturally around the flesh. These features align with anatomical expectations of a real apple. No signs of deformation or unnatural proportions are evident. Therefore, the apple preserves its realistic shape and volume in both views.",

      "question": "In the cross-section view, is the apple's flesh texture visible and consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cross-section view in Image B displays the apple's interior with a pale yellowish-white flesh that has a fine-grained, slightly fibrous texture typical of fresh apple tissue. The surface appears moist and dense, with no signs of bruising or discoloration. The core structure, including the seed cavity and surrounding pith, is clearly defined and proportionate. The texture is uniform across the exposed area, matching what one would expect from a freshly cut apple. Given that apple flesh tends to be crisp and tightly packed when fresh, this visual representation is consistent with real-world expectations. Hence, the flesh texture is both visible and consistent.",
