      "question": "Is the pig’s snout clearly visible with two distinct nostrils and a rounded, pink shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig's snout is prominently displayed in the top panel. The snout is rounded and pink, consistent with typical pig anatomy. Two distinct nostrils are clearly visible, positioned symmetrically on the snout. The shading and contours suggest a three-dimensional form, reinforcing the realism of the depiction. This aligns with common biological knowledge about pigs, where the snout is a defining feature. The illustration style, though stylized, maintains anatomical accuracy in this detail.",

      "question": "Are the pig’s ears large, upright, and pink with visible inner ear details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig’s ears are depicted as large and upright, extending outward from the head. They are colored pink, matching the pig’s skin tone. The inner structure of the ears is visible, showing subtle folds and contours that mimic real ear anatomy. This level of detail suggests an intentional effort to render the ears realistically within the artistic style. The ears’ size and positioning contribute to the character’s expressive appearance, which is common in anthropomorphic animal illustrations.",

      "question": "Are the sunglasses red in color with round lenses and a thin frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig wears sunglasses in the bottom-left panel. These sunglasses are red in color, with round lenses and a thin frame. The design is consistent across all panels where the pig appears, although the color varies (e.g., green in the top panel). However, the question specifically refers to red sunglasses, which are present in the bottom-left panel. The red lenses and thin frame are clearly visible, matching the description. The variation in lens color across panels indicates different artistic choices, but the red version meets the criteria.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top panel shows the pig operating a DJ setup. The equipment includes a black turntable with a silver-colored platter, which is standard for vinyl record players. A tonearm is visible extending toward the platter, and various mixer controls such as knobs and sliders are present on the device. The pig’s hands are positioned over these controls, indicating interaction with the equipment. This setup is consistent with professional DJ gear, and the visual details match the description provided.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top panel shows the pig wearing a red shirt, but there are no visible headphones draped around its neck. While the pig is engaged in DJing, which typically involves headphones, none are present in the image. The absence of headphones is notable given the context of music production. Therefore, based on the visual evidence, the statement is false.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig is consistently depicted wearing a red short-sleeved shirt across all panels. The shirt has a visible collar and sleeves, which are clearly outlined. The fabric appears slightly textured, suggesting a casual or performance-style garment. The consistency of the shirt’s design across panels reinforces its role as part of the pig’s character identity. This matches the description of a red short-sleeved shirt with a collar and sleeves.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top panel shows the pig’s front hooves positioned on the turntable platter and adjacent mixer controls. One hoof is on the platter, likely adjusting the record, while the other interacts with the mixer. This placement is consistent with DJing behavior, where precise hand movements are required. The hooves are detailed enough to distinguish their function, and their positioning aligns with the expected interaction with DJ equipment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig’s skin is rendered in shades of pink, consistent with typical pig anatomy. The texture includes subtle wrinkles, especially around the snout and neck area, which add realism to the character. Light reflections are visible on the skin, particularly on the forehead and cheeks, indicating a smooth yet slightly uneven surface. These details suggest careful attention to texture and lighting, enhancing the lifelike quality of the illustration despite its cartoonish style.",
