    "Question": "Q1: Is the McLaren logo clearly visible on the center of the car's hood?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the silver sports car is prominently displayed. The hood features a central emblem that matches the known design of the McLaren logo — a circular badge with a stylized 'M' and the brand name beneath it. The lighting in the image highlights this area, and the emblem is positioned exactly where the McLaren logo would be located on a real McLaren vehicle, such as the 720S or similar models. The clarity of the image allows for identification of the logo despite its small size. Based on visual cues and world knowledge about McLaren branding placement, the logo is indeed visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the headlights shaped in a narrow, curved, and horizontally elongated design with internal LED strips?",
    "explanation": "The headlights in Image B are distinctly narrow and horizontally elongated, following a sleek, aerodynamic contour typical of high-performance supercars like the McLaren 720S. They feature an internal structure with bright, segmented illumination patterns consistent with LED strips arranged in a curved fashion. This design aligns with McLaren’s signature headlight styling, which includes sharp, angular edges and integrated LED daytime running lights. The visual details confirm the presence of these features, supported by common design language used in modern luxury sports cars.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the brake calipers behind the front wheels colored bright orange?",
    "explanation": "Looking at the front wheel assembly of the car in Image B, the brake calipers are visible through the spokes of the alloy wheels. They exhibit a vivid orange color, which is a signature feature often associated with McLaren vehicles, especially performance variants. Bright orange calipers are commonly used in McLaren models to enhance visual appeal and signal high-performance braking systems. The contrast between the silver wheels and the orange calipers is clear and deliberate, indicating intentional design choice. This observation is consistent with real-world McLaren aesthetics.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the tree leaves display a vibrant, natural green color without significant discoloration?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trees within the transparent cube model and surrounding the cityscape have foliage that appears lush and uniformly green. The leaves show no signs of yellowing, browning, or other discoloration typically associated with unhealthy vegetation or artificial rendering flaws. The lighting enhances their vibrancy, suggesting a healthy, natural appearance. While this is a miniature diorama, the attention to detail in the leaf texture and color indicates a realistic representation. Combined with the context of a well-maintained urban environment in the scene, the greenery appears natural and undamaged.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are white lane markings present on the asphalt road beneath the car?",
    "explanation": "The road surface beneath the car in Image B shows clearly defined white lane markings. These include dashed lines indicating traffic lanes and solid white lines near the curb, consistent with standard road design. The markings are crisp and evenly spaced, contributing to the realism of the miniature urban setting. Even though the car is placed outside the glass cube, the road continues into the foreground, and the lane markings are visible directly under and around the vehicle. This detail supports the illusion of a real-world street environment within the diorama setup.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the car have a raised, sharply angled edge along the side above the wheel arches indicating dihedral door hinges?",
    "explanation": "The side profile of the car in Image B reveals a distinct raised ridge that runs along the upper edge of the wheel arches, extending toward the rear. This design element is characteristic of McLaren’s dihedral doors, which open vertically upward. The sharp angle and structural prominence of this feature suggest the presence of hinges hidden beneath the bodywork, allowing the doors to pivot upwards. This design is iconic in McLaren vehicles such as the 720S and P1, where the dihedral door mechanism requires such a structural line. The visual evidence strongly supports the existence of this feature.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Are there at least two other cars visible in the background — one red and one yellow?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a transparent cube containing a miniature cityscape. Within this scene, several vehicles can be seen on the roads inside the cube. A yellow car is clearly visible on the right side of the cube, near the curb. However, there is no red car discernible in the background. Instead, there appears to be a dark-colored car (possibly black or deep blue) further back, but no red vehicle is evident. The absence of a red car contradicts the requirement for both colors. Therefore, while one yellow car is present, the second required car (red) is not visible.",
    "answer": "No"
