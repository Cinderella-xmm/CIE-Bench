      "question": "Are there exactly three women in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three distinct female figures standing side by side. Each woman has unique facial features, hairstyles, and attire, which confirms their individuality. There are no additional figures partially hidden or obscured in the background. Based on visual observation, all three women are clearly present and identifiable. The composition is symmetrical and balanced, with each person occupying a defined space in the frame. Therefore, it can be concluded that there are exactly three women in the image.",

      "question": "Is the central woman positioned directly between the other two women?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central woman is placed symmetrically between the two other women. She is aligned with the vertical center of the frame, and the spacing between her and each of the outer women appears equal. This positioning creates a balanced composition typical of formal portraits. The architectural elements in the background (arches) also reinforce this symmetry, suggesting intentional placement. Thus, the central woman is indeed positioned directly between the other two.",

      "question": "Do all three women hold bouquets in front of their bodies with both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each of the three women is holding a bouquet. The central woman holds a dark-colored bouquet (predominantly deep red roses) with both hands, positioned in front of her body. The woman on the left holds a bouquet with lighter flowers in a golden vase, using both hands. Similarly, the woman on the right holds a similar bouquet in a golden vase with both hands. All bouquets are held at waist level and centered in front of their bodies. No hand is visibly missing from the bouquet, and all appear to be gripping them symmetrically. Therefore, all three women meet the condition of holding bouquets in front of their bodies with both hands.",

      "question": "Are all three women facing directly toward the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All three women are oriented such that their faces are fully visible and directed toward the camera. Their eyes are looking forward, and their heads are not turned to the side. The alignment of their shoulders and posture indicates they are facing straight ahead. There is no indication of profile views or angled gazes. This frontal orientation is consistent across all three individuals, suggesting they were posed for a direct portrait shot. Hence, all three are facing directly toward the camera.",

      "question": "Are all three women standing upright with full body visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each woman stands in an upright posture with their spine aligned vertically. Their feet are planted firmly on the ground, and their bodies are not leaning or bent. The image captures them from head to toe, showing their entire height without any truncation at the top or bottom. The dresses extend to the ground, and the lower parts of their legs and feet are visible, confirming full-body visibility. There are no signs of cropping or obstruction. Therefore, all three women are standing upright with full bodies visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central woman's mouth is open in a broad smile, revealing her upper teeth. Her lips are parted significantly, and her facial expression conveys joy or laughter. The shape of her mouth and the visibility of her teeth are clear indicators of an open-mouthed smile. This is consistent with expressions seen in celebratory or formal portraits where emotional engagement is emphasized. Therefore, she does have a wide, open-mouthed smile showing teeth.",
