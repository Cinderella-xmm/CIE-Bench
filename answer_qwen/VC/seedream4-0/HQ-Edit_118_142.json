      "question": "Does the transformed book retain a rectangular shape with visible binding and page structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is displayed inside a glass dome and appears to be open, revealing pages with text. The structure of the book maintains a rectangular form, with visible edges of the pages and a clear binding along the spine. The pages are fanned out slightly, but the overall shape remains consistent with a traditional book format. The binding is evident as a central spine connecting the two halves of the book. This aligns with common knowledge about physical books, where the rectangular shape and binding are essential features for holding pages together. Even though the book is part of a diorama, its fundamental structure has not been altered in terms of shape or binding.",

      "question": "Does the quill retain its feathered shaft and tapered tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quill is positioned vertically within the glass dome, mounted on a brass stand. The feathered shaft is clearly visible, with natural barbs extending from the central rachis, characteristic of a real bird feather used historically for writing. The tip of the quill is tapered and pointed, which is necessary for writing with ink. This matches the typical appearance of a quill pen, where the feather is prepared by trimming the tip to create a fine point. The visual details confirm that both the shaft and tip are intact and properly shaped for use.",

      "question": "Does the inkwell retain a container shape with visible dark liquid inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the inkwell is placed on a decorative brass tray. It is a small, round glass container with a narrow opening, filled with a dark, viscous liquid—consistent with traditional ink. The transparency of the glass allows the dark liquid to be clearly seen, confirming its presence. The shape is typical of historical inkwells, designed to hold enough ink for writing without spilling. The liquid’s color and consistency match expectations for iron-gall ink, commonly used in earlier centuries. Thus, the inkwell retains both its container form and contains visible dark liquid.",

      "question": "Are the book, quill, and inkwell positioned in a way that suggests they function together as writing tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is open and centered under a glass dome, with the quill standing upright on a stand directly in front of it, suggesting a ready-to-use setup. The inkwell is placed nearby on a tray, within easy reach of the quill. This arrangement mimics a traditional writing station where one would dip the quill into the inkwell and write in the book. The spatial relationship between these objects—quill poised near the book, inkwell accessible—implies functional integration. This layout reflects historical writing practices and reinforces the idea that these items are meant to be used together.",

      "question": "Does the diorama retain a vintage aesthetic with dark wood, brass, and aged materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a glass dome enclosing the book and quill, resting on a wooden base with an engraved map design, suggesting aged craftsmanship. The surrounding elements include brass fixtures such as the quill holder and inkwell tray, both exhibiting a polished yet antique finish. The table surface is made of dark wood with visible grain, and the background includes stacked leather-bound books, contributing to an old-world atmosphere. These materials—dark wood, brass, aged paper, and leather—are hallmarks of vintage or Victorian-era decor. The lighting and shadows further enhance the nostalgic ambiance, reinforcing the vintage aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is there an ornate decorative border or frame visible on the book’s cover?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is open, so the front cover is not fully visible. However, the edges of the pages and the spine show no indication of an ornate decorative border on the cover itself. Instead, the focus is on the interior pages, which feature sculpted figures emerging from the book—a fantastical element rather than a traditional decorative frame. In contrast, in Image A, the closed book displays a prominent ornate oval frame with intricate carvings on its cover. Since the book in Image B is open and the cover is not clearly shown, the ornate border is not visible in this image. Therefore, based solely on Image B, the decorative border is not present or visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the inkwell is placed on a scalloped, flower-shaped brass tray. This tray serves as a base, preventing spills and adding an ornamental touch. The tray is elevated slightly above the wooden surface, indicating intentional support. This setup is consistent with historical writing desks, where inkwells were often placed on trays to catch drips and protect surfaces. The presence of this supporting tray confirms that the inkwell is indeed supported by a base.",
