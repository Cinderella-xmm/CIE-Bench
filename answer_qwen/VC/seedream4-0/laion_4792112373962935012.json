      "question": "Is the cocktail liquid pale yellow in color?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cocktail inside the glass appears to be a pale yellow hue. This is consistent with common representations of margaritas or similar citrus-based cocktails. The liquid has a translucent quality with a light yellow tone, which aligns with typical visual characteristics of such drinks. The lighting and color saturation in the image emphasize this pale yellow shade, reinforcing the conclusion.",

      "question": "Does the lime wedge have a bright green outer rind and visible segmented interior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime wedge used as a garnish on the glass has a vivid, bright green outer rind, which is typical for fresh limes. The interior of the lime wedge shows distinct segments, characteristic of citrus fruit anatomy. These features are clearly visible despite the stylized nature of the image, suggesting attention to realistic detail even within a cartoonish context.",

      "question": "Is the rim of the glass coated with a speckled mixture of white and red granules?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rim of the glass is decorated with a textured coating that includes both white and reddish granules. This appearance is consistent with a salt and chili powder mixture commonly used in spicy margaritas. The speckled pattern suggests a combination of these two ingredients, which is a popular garnishing technique in Mexican-inspired cocktails.",

      "question": "Are there multiple translucent, angular ice cubes visible inside the glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass contains several ice cubes that are translucent and have angular shapes, typical of standard ice cubes used in cocktails. Despite the cartoonish style, the ice cubes are clearly defined with sharp edges and a clear appearance, indicating they are meant to represent real ice cubes. Their presence and form are consistent with how ice is typically depicted in drink illustrations.",

      "question": "Is the glass placed on a dark blue surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the glass is a deep, dark blue color. This is evident from the background texture and coloration surrounding the glass and other objects like the knife and lime slices. The dark blue provides contrast to the bright colors of the drink and garnishes, enhancing the visual appeal. This matches the description of a dark blue surface.",
