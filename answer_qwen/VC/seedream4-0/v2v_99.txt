    "Question": "Q1: Is the text 'RONALOO' and the number '7' visible on the player's jersey?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the player's jersey clearly displays the name 'RONALDO' in yellow capital letters across the back, above the number '7', which is also in yellow. The spelling 'RONALOO' is incorrect; the correct spelling is 'RONALDO'. However, the image shows 'RONALDO', not 'RONALOO'. Therefore, based on visual inspection, the text shown is 'RONALDO', not 'RONALOO'. This conclusion is drawn from direct observation of the jersey's text, combined with world knowledge that Cristiano Ronaldo's name is spelled 'RONALDO'.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the player depicted in the act of kicking the soccer ball?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the player is captured mid-motion with one leg extended backward and the other forward, suggesting a dynamic movement consistent with a kick. The soccer ball is positioned near the goalpost, slightly ahead of the player, indicating it has just been struck. The player's body posture, including the bent knee and forward lean, aligns with the biomechanics of a soccer kick. Given these visual cues and general knowledge of soccer actions, it is reasonable to conclude that the player is depicted in the act of kicking the ball.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the stadium filled with spectators and equipped with bright lights visible in the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background reveals a large stadium with multiple tiers of seating, all densely populated with colorful figures representing spectators. Additionally, bright stadium lights are visible along the upper structure of the stadium, illuminating the field. These elements are consistent with a professional soccer match setting. Based on the visual details and common knowledge about sports stadiums, the presence of both spectators and lighting is evident.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the goalkeeper dressed in green positioned near the goalpost?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a figure wearing a bright green uniform is visible behind the goalpost, standing in a ready stance typical of a goalkeeper. The position and attire align with standard soccer goalkeeper roles. The individual is located close to the goal, within the penalty area, which is consistent with a goalkeeperâ€™s positioning during play. Thus, based on visual evidence and knowledge of soccer roles, the goalkeeper is indeed dressed in green and positioned near the goalpost.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the soccer ball shown in motion, heading toward the goalpost?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is located just outside the goal net, slightly above the ground, and appears to be moving toward the goalpost. The ball's position relative to the player and the net, along with the implied trajectory from the player's kicking motion, suggests it is in motion and heading into the goal. The lack of contact between the ball and any surface (like the ground or net) supports the idea of ongoing motion. Combined with typical physics of a kicked ball in soccer, this indicates the ball is en route to the goal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
