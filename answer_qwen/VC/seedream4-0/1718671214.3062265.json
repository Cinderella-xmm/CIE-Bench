      "question": "Is the metallic mask with horn-like protrusions at the temples present and retaining its original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mask is clearly visible and positioned over the upper portion of the face, covering the eyes and nose. It features two distinct horn-like protrusions at the temples, which are consistent with the description of a stylized, possibly mythical or ceremonial mask. The mask's shape appears to retain the same angular contours and structure as in typical representations of such masks—specifically resembling a stylized animal or spirit motif. Although the image is stylized with bold lines and flat color areas typical of digital illustration, the overall form and key features (including the horns) remain intact and recognizable. The visual cues indicate that the mask has not been distorted or altered in shape, despite the artistic rendering.",

      "question": "Are the red lips and visible lower face (including chin and jawline) clearly present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower face is fully visible below the mask. The lips are distinctly rendered in a reddish tone, consistent with traditional makeup styles often seen in Japanese-inspired art. The chin and jawline are clearly defined and symmetrical, showing no signs of distortion or alteration. The skin tone around this area is smooth and uniformly lit, suggesting intentional artistic clarity. Comparing with common aesthetic standards in illustrated portraits, these facial features are preserved with precision. There is no indication of blurring, deformation, or stylistic exaggeration that would suggest change from the original. Thus, the lower face remains clearly present and unchanged.",

      "question": "Is the black hair styled in an updo with floral branches positioned symmetrically on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hair in Image B is styled in a high updo, with a long braid falling down the back, which is characteristic of traditional Japanese hairstyles such as those worn by geisha or characters in historical narratives. On both sides of the head, there are elaborate floral arrangements extending outward. These include cherry blossom branches and other flowers, arranged in a balanced manner across the left and right sides. The symmetry is evident in the placement of the branches and their positioning relative to the central axis of the face. This bilateral arrangement suggests careful composition, reinforcing the idea of symmetry. Based on visual inspection and knowledge of traditional Japanese aesthetics, such symmetry is intentional and reflects cultural norms in portraiture.",

      "question": "Are cherry blossom branches visibly integrated into the hair on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, cherry blossom branches are clearly visible and integrated into the hairstyle on both sides of the head. The blossoms are depicted in shades of pink and white, with delicate petals and thin stems, consistent with the appearance of sakura (cherry blossoms). They extend outward from the hair, forming part of the ornamental headpiece. The integration is seamless, with the branches appearing to emerge naturally from within the hair structure. This is a common motif in Japanese art and fashion, symbolizing beauty, transience, and spring. The presence of these elements on both sides reinforces their role as decorative and symbolic components of the overall look.",

      "question": "Is the subject’s facial skin tone fair and uniformly lit, matching the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s facial skin tone appears fair and evenly illuminated. The lighting is soft and consistent across the visible portions of the face, particularly the cheeks, chin, and neck. There are no harsh shadows or uneven highlights that would suggest inconsistent lighting. The skin texture is smooth and uniform, typical of stylized illustrations where realism is balanced with idealization. While the image is not photorealistic, it maintains a consistent aesthetic standard for skin tone representation. Given that the original image likely had similar lighting and tone, and considering the absence of any noticeable deviation in hue or contrast, the skin tone can be considered fair and uniformly lit, matching the expected standard.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B is positioned centrally within the frame, with the head and shoulders aligned along the vertical axis. The facial features, including the eyes, nose, and mouth, are oriented straight ahead, indicating a direct frontal view. The composition is balanced, with equal spacing between the subject and the edges of the frame. The floral arrangements on either side of the head mirror each other, further supporting the symmetry. The posture is upright and static, contributing to a sense of balance and formal presentation. This alignment and balance are hallmarks of a centered, symmetrical pose, commonly used in portrait art to convey dignity and focus.",

      "question": "Does the mask retain a textured, metallic surface appearance rather than becoming smooth or cartoonish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mask in Image B exhibits a detailed, textured surface with patterns that suggest a metallic finish. Despite the stylized, illustrative nature of the artwork, the mask includes fine lines and shading that mimic the look of metal with embossed details. The texture is not uniformly flat but shows variations in tone and depth, especially around the edges and horns, which give it a three-dimensional quality. However, due to the artistic style, some aspects may appear simplified compared to a realistic rendering. Nonetheless, the intention to depict a textured, metallic surface is clear and maintained. It does not appear overly smooth or entirely cartoonish; instead, it retains enough detail to suggest materiality and craftsmanship. Therefore, while stylized, the mask preserves its intended textured, metallic character.",
