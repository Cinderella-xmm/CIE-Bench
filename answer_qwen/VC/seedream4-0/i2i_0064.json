      "question": "Is the text \"REVERE BEACH\" visible on the clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image in question (Image B) shows a cat sitting on a couch, wearing glasses and holding a remote control. There is no clock present in this image at all. Therefore, the text 'REVERE BEACH' cannot be visible on any clock in Image B. This conclusion is based on the visual content of Image B, which clearly lacks any clock or related object. The presence of a clock with such text would require it to be physically present and legible, which is not the case here.",

      "question": "Does the clock face display Roman numerals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clock present. The image features a cat lounging on a couch, watching television. Since there is no clock in the scene, there is no clock face to analyze for numerals. The absence of a clock means that the question about Roman numerals is irrelevant to the content of Image B. Thus, the answer must reflect that no such clock exists in this image.",

      "question": "Is the clock mounted on a tall, ornate metal post?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a clock at all. It depicts a domestic scene with a cat sitting on a sofa, holding a remote control. There is no structure resembling a clock or a metal post in the image. Therefore, the description of a clock mounted on an ornate metal post does not apply to Image B. The reasoning is straightforward: if the object (clock) is not present, then its mounting or design cannot be assessed.",

      "question": "Is the clock positioned against a backdrop featuring the ocean and a clear sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an indoor setting with a cat on a couch, a television, a lamp, and furniture typical of a living room. There is no indication of an outdoor environment, nor is there any view of the ocean or sky. The background consists of household items and warm lighting, suggesting an interior space. Therefore, the clock—of which there is none—is not positioned against an oceanic or sky backdrop. The reasoning relies on identifying the environment as indoors and devoid of natural outdoor scenery.",

      "question": "Is the clock face oriented toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there is no clock in Image B, there is no clock face to assess for orientation. The image contains a cat, a couch, a TV, and other household objects, but no clock. Without the presence of a clock, the question of whether its face is oriented toward the viewer is moot. The conclusion is based on the complete absence of the object in question within the visual field.",
