      "question": "Are the girl’s eyes clearly blue in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's eyes are depicted with a distinct blue hue, which is consistent with typical representations of blue eyes in animated or stylized illustrations. The irises are clearly shaded in blue, and the contrast with the surrounding skin tone and eyelashes makes the color unmistakable. This is further supported by common artistic conventions where eye color is rendered with clear, saturated tones to emphasize features. While the style is cartoonish, the blue coloration is intentional and visually prominent.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rubber duck in Image B has a bright yellow body, which is standard for classic rubber ducks. Its beak is orange, matching the typical design of such toys. The eye is black, depicted as a simple dot, which aligns with the minimalist design often used in cartoon-style illustrations of rubber ducks. These features are consistent with widely recognized visual characteristics of a traditional rubber duck, even in stylized forms.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beret in Image B is clearly pink in color. The texture appears soft and slightly fuzzy, indicated by the subtle shading and surface rendering that suggests a plush or wool-like material. In cartoon or anime-style art, such textures are often implied through soft edges and light diffusion, which is present here. This matches the typical depiction of a soft, fluffy beret, especially one designed for children.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bathtub in Image B is white and has a rounded, vintage shape characteristic of a traditional clawfoot tub. Although the legs are not fully visible, the curved silhouette and elevated edge suggest a clawfoot design.
