        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toilet appears to be made of ceramic material, which is typically white in standard bathroom fixtures. The visual cues show that the bowl, seat, lid, and tank are all uniformly white with no visible discoloration or stains. This aligns with common knowledge that toilets are manufactured in white for hygiene and aesthetic reasons. There are no signs of paint, dirt, or other materials altering the primary color. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and world knowledge about typical toilet design, the toilet remains predominantly white.",

      "question": "Is the toilet lid still open?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The toilet lid in Image B is visibly raised, with the hinge mechanism clearly showing that it is not closed. The lid is positioned vertically, allowing a view into the bowl, which is consistent with an open state. This matches the typical behavior of a toilet lid when not in use. There is no indication of movement or change from this state, so we can confidently determine that the lid is open. This conclusion is supported by common understanding of toilet operation and physical positioning.",

      "question": "Is the flush tank still attached to the wall above the toilet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flush tank is mounted directly behind the toilet bowl and appears to be connected to the wall via a fixed installation. The tank is positioned at the back of the toilet, aligned with the bowl, and there are no visible signs of detachment or disconnection. While the tank is not physically 'above' the toilet in a vertical sense (it is more behind and slightly elevated), it is securely attached to the wall structure. Based on standard toilet installations, the tank is typically affixed to the wall for stability and plumbing connections. Thus, the flush tank is indeed attached to the wall, even if not directly above.",

      "question": "Are the walls and floor still covered with gray square tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The walls and floor in Image B display a uniform pattern of large, square tiles with a light gray or beige tone. The grout lines are evenly spaced, and the tile surface appears smooth and consistent with ceramic or porcelain tiling commonly used in bathrooms. This matches typical bathroom design standards where durability and water resistance are important. The lighting does not distort the color significantly, and the tiles maintain their shape and color across both surfaces. There are no changes such as different patterns, colors, or materials introduced. Therefore, the walls and floor remain covered with gray square tiles.",

      "question": "Is the toilet still positioned in the corner of the room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toilet is placed between two tiled walls that meet at a 90-degree angle, indicating it is located in the corner of the room. The positioning allows for maximum space efficiency in small bathrooms, which is a common design choice. The alignment of the toilet with the corner walls, along with the visible edges of the adjacent walls, confirms its placement. No part of the toilet extends beyond the corner, and the surrounding space is consistent with a corner installation. This observation is supported by architectural and interior design principles for compact bathroom layouts.",
