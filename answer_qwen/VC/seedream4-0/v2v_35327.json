      "question": "Is the figure’s skin uniformly colored in a vivid blue tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's skin appears predominantly blue, consistent with a vivid blue tone. However, upon closer inspection, the blue is not uniformly applied—there are visible distortions and fluid-like textures, especially around the neck and shoulders, where the blue seems to be melting or flowing. This suggests that while the base color is blue, it is not uniform due to the artistic transformation that includes liquid effects and warping. These visual cues indicate a non-uniform application of the blue hue, influenced by the surreal, dreamlike style of the image. Therefore, despite the overall blue appearance, the lack of uniformity due to these dynamic textures leads to a conclusion that the skin is not uniformly colored.",

      "question": "Is the banana rendered in a metallic gold color with a curved, elongated shape resembling a real banana?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object held by the figure is not a banana but rather a geometric, faceted golden object resembling a polyhedron. It has sharp edges and flat surfaces, which contrasts sharply with the natural, smooth, and curved shape of a real banana. The object also lacks the typical banana features such as a stem and a rounded tip. Instead, it appears more like an abstract or symbolic representation, possibly inspired by the concept of a banana but transformed into a stylized, metallic form. Thus, while it is metallic gold in color, its shape does not resemble a real banana.",

      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, ears) clearly visible and anatomically recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the figure are indeed visible and anatomically recognizable. The eyes, nose, mouth, and ears are present and proportionally accurate to human anatomy. Despite the surreal background and the distorted texture of the skin, the facial structure remains intact and coherent. The eyes are open and directed forward, the nose is well-defined, and the lips are closed in a neutral expression. The ear is clearly visible and properly positioned. These features maintain their natural proportions and spatial relationships, indicating that they are anatomically recognizable even within the context of the fantastical elements surrounding the figure.",

      "question": "Is the hand visible and positioned near the banana, suggesting a prior or ongoing interaction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand is clearly visible and positioned near the golden object (which replaces the banana). The fingers are extended and appear to be holding or supporting the object, suggesting an active interaction. The positioning of the hand relative to the object implies engagement, either in presenting or manipulating it. Although the object is not a real banana, the hand’s posture and proximity to it still convey a sense of interaction. Therefore, based on the visual cues, the hand is visible and engaged with the object, fulfilling the criteria of a prior or ongoing interaction.",

      "question": "Is the figure shown in a side profile with the head turned slightly forward, facing right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted in a side profile view, with the face oriented toward the right side of the frame. The head is turned slightly forward, allowing partial visibility of the front of the face, including both eyes and the nose. This slight forward tilt gives depth to the profile without fully transitioning to a frontal view. The alignment of the facial features and the direction of gaze confirm that the figure is facing right. This matches the description of a side profile with a slight forward turn, consistent with the visual evidence in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is highly transformed and surreal, featuring swirling colors, abstract shapes, celestial bodies, and otherworldly landscapes. Despite the distortion, there is clearly a background present behind the figure. Elements such as floating planets, colorful nebulae, and liquid-like formations provide depth and context to the scene. Even though the background is not realistic or naturalistic, it is distinctly separate from the figure and contributes to the overall composition. Therefore, the presence of a background, albeit warped and fantastical, is evident.",
