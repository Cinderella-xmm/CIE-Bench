      "question": "Is the upper garment (jeogori) olive green in color with a smooth, satin-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper garment (jeogori) is clearly visible and appears to be olive green in hue. The surface of the fabric reflects light in a way that suggests a smooth, lustrous finish, consistent with satin or silk material commonly used in traditional Korean hanbok attire. This visual cue—light reflection and subtle sheen—is characteristic of satin-like textiles. Additionally, the floral embroidery on the jeogori is delicately rendered, further supporting the idea of a fine, high-quality fabric. Based on these observations and world knowledge about traditional Korean clothing materials, the description aligns with an olive green, satin-like jeogori.",

      "question": "Is the lower garment (chima) a pale pink pleated skirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower garment in Image B is visibly a full, flowing skirt with distinct vertical folds, which are characteristic of a pleated chima. Its color is a soft, pale pink, consistent with traditional hanbok designs that often use pastel tones. The pleats are evenly spaced and structured, indicating careful tailoring typical of formal hanbok attire. The presence of subtle floral patterns on the skirt further supports its identification as a decorative chima. These visual features, combined with cultural knowledge about Korean traditional dress, confirm that the chima is indeed pale pink and pleated.",

      "question": "Is there a white collar visible at the neckline of the jeogori?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neckline of the jeogori shows a contrasting white trim that extends from the front opening upward along the V-shaped collar. This white inner lining or collar is a common feature in traditional hanbok design, where it provides both aesthetic contrast and structural detail. The white portion is clearly distinguishable from the olive green outer fabric, and its placement matches the standard construction of a jeogori. Therefore, based on visual evidence and knowledge of hanbok anatomy, a white collar is present.",

      "question": "Is the belt dark-colored with a small red square fabric accent at the center knot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The belt (or sash) in Image B is dark in color—appearing black or very dark gray—and wraps around the waist, tied in a central knot. At the center of this knot, there is a small, square-shaped piece of fabric that is distinctly red, matching the traditional 'dol' or 'daenggi' embellishment found in hanbok. This red accent is a key decorative element often used to highlight the waistline and add contrast. The shape and placement are consistent with known hanbok styling. Thus, the description is accurate.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a decorative hairpin is visible on the right side of the subject’s hair (from the viewer's perspective). The pin features intricate details resembling flowers and possibly leaves, consistent with traditional Korean hair accessories such as 'binyeo'. These ornaments are typically worn during formal occasions and are designed with floral or nature-inspired motifs. The positioning on the right side of the hair aligns with common styling practices for women in hanbok. The visual details support the conclusion that this is a floral-designed hairpin.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both ears in Image B display earrings that hang down from the earlobe. They consist of multiple components, including what appears to be a circular or floral top piece connected to a chain or string ending in a small pendant. This structure is typical of traditional Korean 'choo-ri' earrings, which are often elaborately designed with metallic elements and gem-like accents. The symmetry and detail suggest ornate craftsmanship. Since both ears have identical earrings, they are clearly visible on both sides. Therefore, the answer is affirmative.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features of the subject in Image B show dark brown or black eyes, which are common in East Asian aesthetics and consistent with traditional depictions. The lips are painted a vibrant red, a hallmark of classic makeup styles associated with hanbok wearers in art and historical imagery. Additionally, the cheeks exhibit a soft pink blush, suggesting rosy cheeks—a common beauty ideal in Korean culture and often emphasized in traditional portraits. These features are visually clear and align with both cultural norms and artistic representations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted in a vertical, upright posture within a wooden frame. Her hands are positioned together in front of her waist, with fingers gently interlaced or resting one over the other. This pose is typical of formal portraiture in traditional Korean art, symbolizing modesty and grace. Although the figure is presented in a box-like setting (possibly a diorama), the posture remains consistent with a standing position. The hands are not held apart or in any dynamic gesture but are clearly clasped or joined in front. Therefore, the description holds true.",
