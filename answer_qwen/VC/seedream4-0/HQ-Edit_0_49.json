      "question": "Does the teapot retain the original curved spout with a sharply pointed tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot's spout is clearly visible and exhibits a smooth, elegant curve that tapers to a sharp, pointed tip. This form matches typical designs of ornate metal teapots, especially those from the Victorian or Baroque era, where such spouts are common for both functional and aesthetic reasons. The curvature and pointed tip are consistent with traditional craftsmanship aimed at controlled pouring. There is no indication of any alteration to this feature in Image B. Comparing it to Image A (which shows the same teapot without a glass dome), the spout appears identical in shape and design. Thus, the spout retains its original form.",

      "question": "Is the handle shaped with elaborate leaf-like embellishments and a looping baroque form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle in Image B displays intricate detailing characteristic of baroque design, including swirling forms and what appear to be stylized leaf motifs. These embellishments are consistent with high-end decorative metalwork, often seen in antique silverware. The looping structure of the handle suggests a deliberate artistic choice to enhance both grip and visual appeal. When compared to Image A, the handle maintains the same ornate pattern and structural complexity, confirming that the design has not been altered. The visual cues—such as the symmetry and depth of the carvings—support the conclusion that the handle retains its original elaborate form.",

      "question": "Does the lid feature a domed shape with a finial at the apex that matches the original stylized knob form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lid of the teapot is clearly domed, with a central finial that resembles a stylized knob. The finial is topped with a small, pointed element, which is typical of classical teapot designs meant to provide both balance and elegance. The dome itself features detailed engraving that aligns with the rest of the body’s ornamentation. When comparing to Image A, the lid’s shape and finial are visually identical, indicating no changes have been made. The consistency in design elements across both images supports the conclusion that the lid retains its original form.",

      "question": "Are the floral and scroll engravings present across the body in their original symmetrical and raised configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the teapot in Image B showcases highly detailed engravings featuring floral and scroll patterns. These motifs are symmetrically arranged around the bulbous center, with raised relief work that catches the light, emphasizing their three-dimensional quality. Such symmetry and intricacy are hallmarks of fine metal craftsmanship. Comparing this to Image A, the same patterns and spatial arrangement are visible, suggesting that the engravings have not been modified. The continuity in design between the two images confirms that the original configuration is preserved.",

      "question": "Does the teapot rest on a flared base with a clearly defined textured band matching the original design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot sits on a flared base that features a distinct, textured band around its perimeter. This band contains repeating decorative motifs consistent with the overall style of the teapot. The flare provides stability and enhances the visual balance of the piece. In Image A, the same base design is present, with identical texturing and proportions. The consistency between the two images indicates that the base has not been altered. Therefore, the original design is retained.",

      "question": "Is the teapot's surface still reflective with visible golden highlights consistent with the original metallic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the teapot in Image B is highly reflective, showing clear reflections of surrounding objects and light sources. Golden highlights are visible, particularly along the curves and edges, which suggest a polished metallic finish—likely silver or a silver-plated alloy. These highlights are consistent with the lighting conditions and material properties observed in Image A. The reflective quality and color tone remain unchanged, indicating that the metallic sheen has been preserved. No signs of dulling or discoloration are evident, supporting the conclusion that the original surface characteristics are maintained.",

      "question": "Does the body of the teapot maintain its original rounded, bulbous shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the teapot in Image B is distinctly rounded and bulbous, with a central swelling that tapers slightly toward the base and spout. This silhouette is typical of classic teapot designs intended to hold liquid efficiently while also being aesthetically pleasing. The proportions and curvature match those seen in Image A, confirming that the shape has not been altered. The lighting in Image B accentuates the roundness through shadows and highlights, further validating the preservation of the original form.",
