      "question": "Are the two main mountain peaks still present and positioned side by side as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two main mountain peaks are not visible. Instead, the focus is on a large, fantastical creature resembling a bull with rocky, moss-covered skin and tree-like roots embedded into its body. The background is blurred but does not clearly show the distinct mountain peaks that were prominent in Image A. Based on visual cues, the mountains have been replaced or obscured by the foreground subject. Therefore, the two peaks are not present or positioned side by side as in the original image.",

      "question": "Do the summits of both peaks retain patches of snow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any mountain peaks at all. The central subject is a mythical beast standing in a landscape that appears to be a continuation of the same terrain as Image A, but the mountains themselves are absent. Since there are no visible peaks, it is impossible for them to retain patches of snow. This contrasts with Image A, where both peaks clearly have snow on their summits. The absence of peaks in Image B means this feature cannot be present.",

      "question": "Are the horizontal and vertical rock strata visible on the mountain faces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no mountain faces visible. The focus is entirely on the creature, which has a textured surface resembling stone and organic matter, but this is part of the animalâ€™s design, not geological rock layers. In contrast, Image A clearly shows layered rock formations on the mountainsides, indicating visible strata. Since the mountains are not present in Image B, the rock strata cannot be observed.",

      "question": "Is the narrow road visible winding through the lower valley, extending toward the base of the mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower valley area is partially visible, but the narrow road seen in Image A is not present or discernible. The ground appears rough and natural, possibly with some paths, but there is no clear winding road leading toward any mountains. In Image A, a distinct road runs across the mid-ground, curving gently through the valley. The edited version replaces much of the landscape detail with the creature, obscuring such features. Thus, the road is not visible in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the slopes covered in patches of brownish-orange heather and dry grass, particularly in the mid-ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the immediate foreground includes some vegetation consistent with dry grass and earthy tones, suggesting similar terrain to the original scene. However, the mid-ground is dominated by the large creature, which blocks the view of the broader slope areas. While the color palette of the surrounding environment hints at brownish-orange hues, the specific pattern of heather and grass patches is not clearly visible due to the creature's presence. In Image A, these plant patterns are clearly visible across the slopes. Due to occlusion and focus shift, the detailed vegetation coverage cannot be confirmed in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the sky uniformly overcast with no direct sunlight, resulting in soft shadows across the landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky appears overcast and gray, consistent with diffuse lighting conditions. There are no harsh shadows or bright highlights, indicating the absence of direct sunlight. This matches the lighting in Image A, where the sky was also cloudy and evenly lit. The soft shadows and muted tones suggest a similar atmospheric condition. Although the primary subject is different, the ambient lighting remains consistent with an overcast day, supporting the conclusion that the sky is uniformly overcast.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the valleys are largely obscured by the presence of the large creature. Only portions of the terrain are visible, and they appear fragmented rather than showing smooth, continuous contour lines. The natural flow of the land is interrupted by the creature's form and placement. In Image A, the valleys exhibit clear, flowing contours that reflect the gradual slope of the landscape. Due to the editing and foreground obstruction, the natural topography is not fully visible in Image B, making it impossible to confirm the presence of smooth contour lines.",
