      "question": "Is the central dome present and positioned directly above the main structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central dome is clearly visible and sits atop the main structure of the building. The dome is centered both horizontally and vertically relative to the base of the building, which is consistent with classical architectural design where domes are typically placed centrally to emphasize symmetry and balance. This placement is a common feature in neoclassical or government-style buildings, reinforcing its prominence. The visual cues—such as the alignment of the dome’s base with the top of the rectangular section below—confirm that it is directly above the main structure. The dome appears to be supported by a drum with arched openings, which further supports its central positioning.",

      "question": "Is there a golden star located at the very top of the dome’s spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the top of the dome's spire features a small, star-shaped ornament. Its color appears golden or yellowish, consistent with a decorative gold star often seen on domed structures such as religious or governmental buildings. Given the context of the building’s ornate design and the use of sugar-like materials (suggesting a gingerbread model), the star is likely a decorative element made from edible icing or candy. In real-world architecture, stars atop domes symbolize various things—such as national identity or religious significance—and their presence here aligns with symbolic architectural traditions. Therefore, based on visual evidence and architectural conventions, the golden star is indeed present at the apex of the spire.",

      "question": "Are the windows arranged in a symmetrical grid pattern across the building’s front face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front face of the building displays a series of windows arranged in vertical columns and horizontal rows. The layout is highly symmetrical, with each side mirroring the other around a central axis. The windows are evenly spaced, forming a clear grid pattern that enhances the building’s formal and balanced appearance. This symmetry is typical of neoclassical architecture, which emphasizes order and proportion. Additionally, the use of white icing to outline the windows in this gingerbread model reinforces the structured, geometric arrangement. Thus, the window placement follows a deliberate and symmetrical grid pattern.",

      "question": "Is there a row of vertical columns forming a portico at the ground level of the building’s front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the lower portion of the building’s front facade, where a series of vertical elements resembling columns are visible. These are crafted from what appears to be gingerbread and decorated with white icing to mimic classical columns. They are aligned symmetrically and support an overhang or entablature above them, forming a portico-like structure. While not full-height columns like those in ancient Greek temples, they serve a similar architectural function in this scaled-down, edible model. The presence of these columns at the entrance area suggests a deliberate imitation of classical portico design, commonly found in public or institutional buildings. Hence, a row of vertical columns forming a portico is indeed present at the ground level.",

      "question": "Are there two large trees with golden-yellow foliage positioned symmetrically on both sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two prominent tree-like structures flank the building—one on the left and one on the right. These trees are made from what appears to be caramel or hardened sugar, with leaves shaped like autumn oak leaves in shades of golden-yellow and brown. Their placement is nearly symmetrical relative to the centerline of the building, contributing to the overall balanced composition of the scene. Although they are stylized rather than realistic, their size, shape, and positioning suggest intentional symmetry. This mirrors common landscape design principles where trees are used to frame important structures. Therefore, yes, there are two large trees with golden-yellow foliage positioned symmetrically on either side.",

      "question": "Is there a straight paved road running in front of the building, parallel to its base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground shows a flat, reflective surface that resembles a marble countertop, upon which the gingerbread building is placed. There is no indication of a paved road or any roadway structure in front of the building. Instead, the base of the model rests directly on a smooth, polished surface, likely representing a display platform. Unlike Image A, which may depict a real-world setting with a road, Image B is clearly a miniature or artistic recreation where environmental details like roads are omitted. The absence of a road is consistent with the scale and purpose of the model—intended for display rather than realism. Thus, there is no straight paved road running in front of the building.",

      "question": "Does the building have a square base with rounded corners on the upper levels before transitioning into the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the base of the building is rectangular and appears square when viewed from the front. As we move upward, the structure maintains sharp, angular corners throughout the main body, without any visible rounding. The transition to the dome occurs via a cylindrical drum that surrounds the top of the building, but the corners of the lower sections remain distinctly square. The dome itself sits atop this drum, which has a circular form, but the underlying structure does not exhibit rounded corners on the upper levels prior to the dome. This contrasts with some architectural styles that use curved transitions (e.g., octagonal drums), but here the design remains rectilinear until the drum. Therefore, the building does not have rounded corners on the upper levels before the dome.",
