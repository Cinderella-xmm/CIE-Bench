      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is clearly depicted wearing a blouse with sleeves that extend to her wrists, indicating a long-sleeved garment. The sleeves are rolled up slightly at the cuffs, which is common in historical attire for practicality during chores. Additionally, she is wearing a dark-colored apron tied around her waist with a bow at the back, which is typical of domestic clothing from the 19th century. This combination of a long-sleeved blouse and an apron aligns with common historical dress for women engaged in household labor. The visual details such as the fabric folds, buttoned front, and apron’s placement support this conclusion.",

      "question": "Does the washing machine have a wooden barrel and a crank mechanism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The washing machine in Image B features a large cylindrical wooden barrel supported by four legs, consistent with traditional wringer-style washers used before modern appliances. The barrel is constructed from vertical wooden staves bound by metal hoops, a design typical of early washing machines. On the left side of the device, there is a visible crank mechanism with a handwheel connected to gears, which would be manually turned to operate the rollers above the barrel. This mechanical setup matches historical descriptions of manual washers, where the crank rotated rollers to squeeze water from clothes. The presence of both the wooden barrel and crank mechanism is evident from the image's detailed rendering.",

      "question": "Is the woman actively placing fabric into the wooden barrel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is shown leaning over the wooden barrel with both hands engaged in handling fabric. One hand appears to be pulling or guiding cloth through the rollers above the barrel, while the other hand is positioned inside the barrel, possibly adjusting or submerging the fabric. The positioning of her arms and the way the cloth drapes suggest she is in the process of feeding it into the washing machine. Her posture and focus indicate active involvement in the task, consistent with the operation of a manual washer. Therefore, based on the visual cues and understanding of how such machines were operated historically, she is indeed actively placing fabric into the barrel.",

      "question": "Are the wooden components of the washing machine detailed with visible grain and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden components of the washing machine in Image B exhibit clear signs of wood grain and surface texture. The barrel’s staves show natural variations in color and pattern, indicative of real wood planks. The metal bands around the barrel have slight reflections and wear marks, enhancing the realism. The legs and frame also display subtle textural details such as knots and grain lines. These elements contribute to a highly realistic depiction of aged wood, suggesting careful attention to material authenticity. In contrast to Image A, which uses a monochromatic etching style without texture, Image B employs lighting and shading to emphasize physical detail, making the wood appear tactile and lifelike.",

      "question": "Is the woman's hair tied up and is she wearing an apron?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s hair is neatly styled and pulled back into a bun at the back of her head, a common hairstyle for working women in the 19th century to keep hair out of the face and away from machinery. Her apron is clearly visible, tied around her waist with a bow at the back, extending down past her skirt. This type of apron was standard protective clothing for domestic work. Both the hairstyle and apron are consistent with historical fashion and practicality. Comparing with Image A, the same elements are present but rendered in a sketch-like style; however, in Image B, they are more vividly detailed due to enhanced lighting and texture, confirming their presence.",
