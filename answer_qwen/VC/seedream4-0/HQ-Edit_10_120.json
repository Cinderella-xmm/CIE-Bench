      "question": "Does the edited image retain the elderly woman’s facial expression, including the gentle smile and visible wrinkles around the eyes and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly woman's face is rendered in a watercolor painting style, which softens fine details but still preserves the overall facial expression. The gentle smile is evident, with the corners of the mouth slightly upturned, consistent with a warm, serene demeanor. Wrinkles around the eyes and mouth are present, though stylized to match the artistic medium—visible as subtle lines that suggest age and expression without sharp definition. Watercolor techniques often emphasize mood over photorealistic detail, yet here they successfully convey the emotional tone and key features of the original expression. Based on common artistic interpretation, such stylistic choices do not negate the presence of these features but represent them in a softened form. Therefore, the essential elements of her facial expression are retained.",

      "question": "Is the elderly woman’s short, white, neatly styled hair preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the woman’s hair in a painterly fashion, using light strokes and blended tones to simulate volume and texture. Despite the artistic transformation, the hair remains short, white, and styled in a neat, rounded manner consistent with the original. The silhouette and general shape of the hairstyle are preserved, even if individual strands are not clearly defined due to the watercolor medium. In art, especially in portrait styles like this, maintaining the overall form and color while abstracting detail is standard practice. Thus, the core characteristics of her hair—length, color, and styling—are accurately represented.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the round wire-rimmed glasses with pink-tinted lenses positioned correctly on the woman’s face in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glasses in Image B maintain their round shape and are placed symmetrically across the bridge of the nose, consistent with typical eyewear positioning. The pink tint of the lenses is subtly suggested through coloration within the circular frames, although the effect is softer due to the watercolor technique. While the edges of the wire rims are less sharply defined than in a photograph, their placement and general appearance remain accurate. Artistic rendering often simplifies object contours, but here the key attributes—shape, position, and tint—are preserved enough to confirm correct representation based on visual cues and common knowledge of how such glasses appear.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the woman’s hands clasped gently in front of her body, with visible age-related skin texture and veins, as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are depicted in a simplified manner compared to the original. While the pose—clasped gently in front of the body—is maintained, the detailed textures such as deep wrinkles, prominent veins, and skin creases seen in the original photo are significantly softened or omitted due to the watercolor style. The artistic treatment prioritizes elegance and flow over anatomical precision. As a result, while the posture is preserved, the specific age-related skin details are not clearly visible. This reflects a common trade-off in painted portraits where realism in texture is sacrificed for aesthetic harmony.",

      "question": "Is the background of the image preserved as a tree-lined park path with green hedges and soft daylight, matching the original scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the essential elements of the background: trees with branching trunks, a pathway extending into the distance, and greenery resembling hedges along the sides. The lighting suggests soft daylight, consistent with the original setting. However, the details are stylized with watercolor washes, resulting in blurred edges and diffused colors. Despite this abstraction, the spatial composition and environmental context remain recognizable. Artistic interpretations often simplify backgrounds while preserving the scene's essence. Thus, the core components of the original background are preserved in a transformed but faithful manner.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the qipao’s silhouette, including the high collar, long sleeves, and front closure with black frog buttons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The qipao in Image B maintains the classic silhouette: a high stand-up collar, long sleeves, and a front closure line. The overall shape is consistent with traditional Chinese dress design. Although the fabric pattern is altered with floral motifs and gold accents, the structural elements—collar, sleeve length, and central seam—are clearly preserved. The artistic style does not distort the garment’s outline, indicating intentional fidelity to the original form. Even with changes in texture and color, the fundamental silhouette remains intact.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black frog closures are present along the front center of the qipao, rendered as dark, knot-like shapes connected by a thin line representing the cord. These are stylistically simplified but still identifiable as frog buttons—a distinctive feature of traditional qipaos. The placement is accurate, following the vertical axis of the garment. While the watercolor medium softens their edges, their form and function are clearly represented. This aligns with artistic conventions where symbolic accuracy is maintained even when details are abstracted.",
