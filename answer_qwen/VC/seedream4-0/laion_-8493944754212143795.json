      "question": "Is there visible sunlight reflecting off the water surface, creating bright sparkles and highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface reflects light in a way that suggests illumination from above. The presence of bright, shimmering areas on the water, especially near the dragon’s body and around the ripples, indicates sunlight interacting with the water. These reflections appear as dynamic, glittering highlights consistent with sunlight glinting off moving water. This is further supported by the overall brightness of the scene and the clear sky in the background, which implies daylight conditions. The reflection patterns are not uniform but vary with the water's movement, reinforcing the idea of natural sunlight reflecting off the surface.",

      "question": "Are there visible patches of green moss or algae on the rock surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocks visible in the foreground and beneath the dragon show some texture and color variation, but there are no distinct green patches that would indicate moss or algae. The rocks appear to be covered in a mix of wet stone and possibly mineral deposits, with some darker areas suggesting moisture or shadow, but no vibrant green hues typical of moss or algae. Additionally, the artistic style of the image emphasizes fantasy elements, and the rocks are stylized rather than realistically detailed, making it less likely that subtle biological growth like moss would be accurately depicted. Therefore, based on visual cues and the lack of green pigmentation on the rocks, it is reasonable to conclude that there are no visible patches of green moss or algae.",

      "question": "Is there white, foamy water at the base of the cascade and along the edges of the flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a waterfall or cascade in the traditional sense. Instead, it shows a dragon emerging from water with waves and ripples around its body. However, there is visible white foam forming around the dragon’s limbs and where the water interacts with the rocks. This foam appears particularly concentrated near the dragon’s feet and in the disturbed water, indicating turbulence and splashing. While this foam is not at the base of a falling cascade, it is present along the edges of the flowing water and resembles the kind of foam seen in turbulent aquatic environments. Thus, although the context differs from a natural waterfall, white, foamy water is indeed visible.",

      "question": "Do the rocks exhibit a layered, stepped formation with visible cracks and erosion lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rocks in Image B are partially submerged and appear to be part of a natural shoreline or outcrop. While they do have some texture and irregular shapes, there is no clear evidence of layered, stepped formations such as those seen in sedimentary rock or eroded cliffs. The rocks look more like individual boulders or fragments rather than a continuous, stratified structure. Additionally, erosion lines or fissures are not distinctly visible—any apparent cracks are minor and likely due to artistic rendering rather than geological features. Therefore, based on the visual details and lack of stratification or prominent erosion patterns, the rocks do not exhibit a layered, stepped formation.",

      "question": "Does the water flow downward from the upper part of the image toward the lower part?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water is not shown flowing in a directional cascade from top to bottom. Instead, the dragon is positioned in the middle of the frame, partially submerged, with water surrounding it and rippling outward. There is no visible source of water coming from above or a clear path of descent. The motion in the water appears to be caused by the dragon’s presence and movement, creating waves and disturbances rather than a gravitational flow. Therefore, while water is present and dynamic, it does not flow downward from the upper to the lower part of the image in a cascading manner.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clear contrast between the dark, wet rock surfaces and the bright, fast-moving water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocks are dark and appear wet, especially where they are in contact with the water. The water itself is bright and reflective, with visible ripples and highlights indicating movement. This creates a strong visual contrast between the dark, textured rock surfaces and the lighter, dynamic water. The difference in tone and reflectivity enhances the perception of depth and motion. Even though the dragon dominates the scene, the interaction between the dark rocks and the bright water remains evident, particularly around the base of the dragon and in the surrounding water. This contrast is consistent with natural lighting and water behavior, reinforcing the realism of the scene despite its fantastical subject.",

      "question": "Are there visible water droplets or mist suspended in the air above the falling water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes visible mist and vapor rising from the water, particularly around the dragon’s body and near the surface. These appear as soft, white clouds or wisps that suggest steam or spray, likely generated by the dragon’s presence or movement. While there is no actual 'falling water' like in a waterfall, the mist is clearly suspended in the air and adds to the atmospheric effect. Water droplets are not individually discernible, but the presence of mist indicates fine particles of water in the air, consistent with what might be seen near a splash or disturbance in water. Therefore, although not large droplets, there is visible mist that qualifies as suspended water vapor.",
