      "question": "Does the edited image retain the wide open mouth with visible white teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front face of the ceramic object is clearly visible, and the mouth is depicted as wide open, showing a row of white, rectangular-shaped teeth. This matches the appearance of the mouth in the original image (Image A), where the same feature is present. The editing process appears to have preserved this facial detail intact, even though the back portion of the object has been modified into a jigsaw puzzle pattern. The continuity of the facial features from the original suggests that the mouth and teeth were not altered during editing. Therefore, based on visual analysis and the preservation of facial characteristics, the wide open mouth with visible white teeth is retained.",

      "question": "Are the black eyebrows present and positioned above the eye sockets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the ceramic object are still clearly defined. Two dark, elongated shapes are visible above the eye sockets, matching the position and shape of eyebrows. These are consistent with the black eyebrows seen in Image A. Despite the addition of the puzzle-like design on the rear surface, the front-facing features—including the eyebrows—remain unchanged. This indicates that the editing process focused only on the back portion and did not affect the facial details. Thus, the black eyebrows are present and correctly positioned above the eye sockets.",

      "question": "Are the dark, rounded ears present on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one dark, rounded ear is clearly visible on the right side of the head (from the viewer's perspective). However, due to the angle and the way the object is presented, the left ear is not fully visible. In contrast, in Image A, both ears are visible and symmetrical. The presence of only one clearly visible ear in Image B may be due to the object’s orientation or partial occlusion by the puzzle pieces. Nevertheless, the visible ear matches the description of being dark and rounded. Given that the object appears to be symmetrically designed and the visible ear is consistent with the original, it is reasonable to infer that the second ear exists but is obscured. Therefore, the dark, rounded ears are present on both sides, even if not fully visible in this view.",

      "question": "Are there two circular eye sockets visible on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two distinct circular openings are visible where the eyes would be located. These correspond directly to the eye sockets seen in Image A. The holes are evenly spaced and symmetrically placed, consistent with typical facial anatomy in such stylized sculptures. The editing process, which introduced puzzle pieces on the back, has not affected the front facial structure. Hence, the eye sockets remain unaltered and clearly visible in Image B. This confirms that both circular eye sockets are present and visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the head features a distinct green-colored area, which is consistent with the green glaze or painted section seen in Image A. This green patch is positioned centrally on the crown of the head and appears to be part of the original design. Although the surrounding areas have been modified with puzzle-like tiles, the green section remains intact and unaltered. This suggests that the editing process preserved key decorative elements, including the green coloration on the top of the head. Therefore, the green-colored section is present.",
