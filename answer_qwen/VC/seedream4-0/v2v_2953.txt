    "Question": "Q1: Is the glass still recognizable as a standard cocktail glass with a cylindrical shape and a flat base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembling a cocktail glass is made of a material that appears to be clay or terracotta, with a rough, textured surface. Despite its artistic rendering, it maintains a generally cylindrical form with a flat base, similar to a standard cocktail glass. The shape is consistent with a tumbler-style glass, which is commonly used for cocktails like Old Fashioneds or Mojitos. However, the texture and material are not typical of real glassware. Based on visual cues, the overall silhouette and proportions align with a standard cocktail glass, even though it is clearly not a real glass but a sculptural representation. Therefore, while not a real glass, it is still recognizable in form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible ice cubes in the glass, maintaining the appearance of a chilled beverage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 'ice cubes' are also crafted from the same clay-like material as the glass, mimicking the shape and arrangement of real ice cubes. They are placed inside the glass in a way that resembles how ice would appear in a cocktail. While they are not actual ice and lack transparency or reflective qualities, their placement and shape are designed to simulate the presence of ice. From a visual perspective, especially in the context of an artistic or sculptural representation, they maintain the appearance of a chilled beverage. Thus, despite being non-functional, they fulfill the visual role of ice cubes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a slice of lime garnishing the rim of the glass?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a green, wedge-shaped object is attached to the rim of the glass, resembling a lime slice. It has the characteristic curved shape and rind texture of a lime wedge, although it is clearly made of the same clay-like material as the rest of the sculpture. Its position and orientation match the typical garnish placement seen in cocktails. Although it is not a real lime, it is visually identifiable as a lime slice garnish based on its form and placement. This aligns with common cocktail presentation practices.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a metallic straw inserted into the cocktail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the straw appears to be made of the same clay-like material as the glass and ice cubes. It is a solid, brownish stick inserted into the drink, resembling a straw in shape and position. However, it lacks the reflective sheen and smooth surface typical of metallic straws. Instead, it has a matte, earthy texture consistent with the rest of the sculpture. Since it is clearly not metallic but rather part of the artistic medium, it cannot be classified as a metallic straw. This contrasts with typical cocktail straws, which are often plastic or metal. Therefore, while it functions as a straw in form, it is not metallic.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the surface beneath the cocktail retain a polished wooden texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the cocktail is depicted with visible grain patterns and a rough, uneven texture, suggesting aged or rustic wood. However, it lacks the smoothness, shine, and reflective quality associated with a polished wooden surface. Instead, it appears more like carved or molded wood, possibly part of the same sculptural material. In contrast, polished wood typically reflects light and has a refined finish. The surface here is intentionally textured and unpolished, indicating it is not meant to represent a real polished bar top. Therefore, while it resembles wood, it does not have a polished texture.",
    "answer": "No"
