      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor appears to be made of large, irregularly shaped stones with a grayish tone, consistent with a stone-paved surface. Despite the fantastical elements introduced (such as floating moss platforms and glowing orbs), the base flooring remains visible beneath these additions. The texture and pattern of the stones are clearly discernible, matching the appearance of a paved stone walkway. This suggests that the original floor structure has been preserved in the edit, even though it is partially obscured by magical elements. Therefore, based on visual cues and spatial continuity, the gray stone-paved floor is indeed present.",

      "question": "Are the metal support beams and window grid patterns visible in the greenhouse structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the greenhouse structure retains its architectural framework. The metal support beams are still visible running horizontally and vertically across the ceiling and walls, forming a grid-like pattern. These beams are consistent with typical greenhouse construction and are not obscured by the fantastical elements. Additionally, the window panes maintain their rectangular grid layout, which is characteristic of glasshouse design. Although some areas are enhanced with glowing effects or foliage, the underlying structural components remain identifiable. Thus, the metal support beams and window grid patterns are still visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shelving units appear to be elevated platforms with a green mesh design, similar to those in the original scene. However, due to the addition of floating moss islands and surreal lighting, the lower portions of the shelves are partially obscured. Upon close inspection, there are no clear indications of wheels at the base of any shelving unit. In fact, the presence of floating platforms suggests that the original mobile shelving units have been replaced or transformed into stationary, magical structures. Therefore, visible wheels are not present in this edited version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plants are now growing on floating moss-covered platforms and fantastical structures rather than traditional shelving units. The original black plastic pots seen in the first image are absent. Instead, the plants appear to be rooted directly into mossy terrain or supported by organic, otherworldly growths. The transformation from realistic potted plants to magical flora indicates that the black plastic pots have been removed or replaced entirely. Hence, black plastic pots are not visible in this edited image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large plant with broad green leaves is still present in the foreground on the right side of the frame. Its size and leaf shape are consistent with the original plant, although it has been stylized with glowing veins and additional vines. The positioning relative to the rest of the scene remains unchanged—dominating the right foreground and partially framing the view. This confirms that despite the artistic modifications, the plant's location and general form are preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the overall layout of the greenhouse is retained, the central aisle is no longer clearly defined. The presence of floating moss platforms, glowing orbs, and fantastical creatures disrupts the linear pathway. The shelving units have been replaced or reimagined as magical structures, and the space between them is filled with suspended elements, making it difficult to identify a continuous, unobstructed aisle. Therefore, the clear central aisle present in the original image is not maintained in this edited version.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area beneath the glass roof where the light brown woven shade canopy was originally located now features glowing, ethereal strands and bioluminescent vines hanging down. These elements replace the functional shade canopy, creating a magical atmosphere. While the structural space above the plants remains similar, the woven material itself is no longer visible—it has been artistically substituted with fantasy-inspired decorations. Therefore, the light brown woven shade canopy is not present in the edited image.",
