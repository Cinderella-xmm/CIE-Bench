      "question": "Does the soccer ball retain exactly 12 black pentagonal panels and 20 white hexagonal panels arranged in a spherical configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is depicted with a stylized, graphic art appearance featuring exaggerated colors and outlines. Despite the artistic rendering, the structure of the ball appears to maintain the traditional pattern of a standard soccer ball: black pentagons surrounded by white hexagons. Upon close inspection, there are 12 distinct black pentagonal shapes visible, each bordered by five white hexagons. This matches the mathematical and design principle of a truncated icosahedron, which is the standard geometry for a soccer ball. The arrangement forms a spherical configuration even though the image uses a pop-art style with halftone dots and vibrant color gradients. Therefore, despite the artistic distortion, the fundamental panel count and layout are preserved.",

      "question": "Is the soccer ball depicted as a three-dimensional sphere with curved surfaces and proper perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the soccer ball with shading, highlights, and depth cues such as light reflection on its surface, indicating a three-dimensional form. The curvature is suggested through the way the panels appear to wrap around the ball, with edges receding into the background and shadows beneath it. Although the artistic style includes bold outlines and color gradients typical of comic or pop-art styles, these elements do not negate the perception of volume and depth. The use of lighting and shadowing creates a sense of roundness and spatial presence, consistent with a 3D spherical object. Thus, despite the stylization, the ball is still interpreted as a three-dimensional sphere with proper perspective.",

      "question": "Does the goalpost maintain a rectangular frame with two vertical posts and one horizontal crossbar forming a standard goal shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the goalpost is clearly structured with two upright vertical posts and a single horizontal crossbar connecting them at the top, forming a rectangular frame. This matches the standard design of a soccer goal. The posts and crossbar are outlined with bright, glittery effects, but their geometric alignment remains consistent with a traditional goal structure. The net extends from the frame, reinforcing the correct orientation and proportions. Even with the stylized visual treatment, the core architectural components of the goalpost—two verticals and one horizontal—are present and correctly positioned.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the net of the goalpost composed of a visible grid pattern of intersecting lines forming square or rectangular cells?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The net in Image B displays a clear grid pattern made up of intersecting lines that form a series of small, roughly square-shaped cells. These lines are drawn with precision and consistency across the entire net area, suggesting a uniform mesh structure typical of a soccer goal net. While the artistic style adds sparkle and glow effects, the underlying grid pattern remains intact and recognizable. The regularity of the intersections confirms that the net maintains the expected geometric structure of a standard soccer goal net.",

      "question": "Is the soccer ball positioned in the foreground, in front of the goalpost, with part of the goal visible behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is clearly placed in the foreground, closer to the viewer than the goalpost. The goalpost is visible behind the ball, with parts of the net and frame appearing partially obscured by the ball’s position. This layering indicates depth and proper spatial arrangement, where the ball is in front and the goal is in the background. The overlap between the ball and the goalpost confirms this relative positioning, which is consistent with typical visual composition in sports imagery.",

      "question": "Are the seams between the black and white panels of the soccer ball clearly visible and aligned with the edges of the pentagons and hexagons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seams between the black and white panels are distinctly outlined, especially due to the high-contrast, graphic style. Each seam follows the boundary between adjacent pentagons and hexagons, accurately reflecting the structural design of a traditional soccer ball. The black lines separating the panels are sharp and continuous, aligning precisely with the edges of the polygons. Even though the image uses halftone textures and color gradients, the seam alignment remains faithful to the actual geometry of the ball’s construction.",

      "question": "Is the soccer ball centered in the foreground and the goalpost positioned directly behind it in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is visually centered within the frame and occupies a central position in the foreground. The goalpost is situated directly behind the ball, aligned along the same central axis, creating a symmetrical composition. This placement ensures that the ball is the primary focal point, with the goal serving as a balanced backdrop. The alignment suggests intentional composition, where both objects are centrally located and oriented toward the viewer. This symmetry reinforces the idea of the ball being centered and the goalpost directly behind it.",
