      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hair is clearly visible at the top of her head. It is gray in color and gathered into a compact, rounded shape consistent with a bun.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the woman's attire in Image B, she is wearing a garment that is light blue in color. The sleeves extend to her wrists, confirming they are long. The neckline is open and angled downward from the shoulders, forming a V-shape, which is characteristic of a V-neck design. This matches the description provided.
