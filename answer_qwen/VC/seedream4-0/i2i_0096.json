      "question": "Is the sofa still black with multiple cushions evenly arranged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa is clearly visible and appears to be black in color, consistent with modern minimalist interior design preferences. The cushions are numerous and uniformly distributed across the seating area, suggesting a deliberate arrangement for both comfort and aesthetic balance. The symmetry and alignment of the cushions indicate they are evenly placed. This observation aligns with common practices in contemporary furniture styling where uniformity enhances visual appeal. There is no evidence of any discoloration or irregular placement that would contradict this assessment.",

      "question": "Does the painting above the sofa retain its swirling orange-red vortex design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The painting in Image B features a central bright orange-yellow core surrounded by concentric swirls transitioning into deeper reds, oranges, and dark blues, creating a vortex-like effect. This abstract composition is consistent with dynamic, expressive art styles often used in modern interiors to draw attention. The swirling motion and color gradient are visually prominent and match the description of a 'swirling orange-red vortex.' No alterations to the design elements are apparent, indicating the original artistic intent has been preserved.",

      "question": "Is the painting still hung directly above the sofa?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting is centered on the wall and positioned such that its horizontal midpoint aligns with the center of the sofa below it. This placement is typical in interior design for achieving visual harmony and balance. The distance between the top of the sofa and the bottom edge of the painting appears consistent with standard hanging guidelines (typically 6â€“12 inches above the furniture). There is no indication of misalignment or off-center positioning, confirming that the painting remains directly above the sofa.",

      "question": "Is the wall behind the sofa a neutral light color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall in Image B appears to be a light, off-white or pale gray tone, which falls within the range of neutral colors commonly used in modern living spaces to create a clean, airy atmosphere. Such colors reflect natural light effectively and serve as a backdrop that enhances the vibrancy of artwork and furniture without competing with them. The absence of strong hues or patterns supports the classification of the wall as neutral and light.",

      "question": "Are there visible sunlight effects and shadows cast by a nearby window on the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows distinct rectangular patterns of light and shadow on the wall and floor, particularly near the left side of the frame. These patterns resemble those created by sunlight passing through window panes, casting geometric shadows typical of daylight entering from a large window. Additionally, the brightness variation across the wall and the presence of soft highlights suggest natural illumination. Given the architectural context and lighting behavior, these are consistent with sunlight effects from a nearby window.",
