      "question": "Are the boots rendered in bright red color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boots are clearly depicted in a vivid, bright red hue. This is consistent with the visual characteristics of the boots in the original image (Image A), where the red color is also prominent. The material appears to be rubber or a similar synthetic substance, typical of rain boots, and the red is uniformly applied across both boots. Given that this is a stylized keychain representation, the color has been preserved accurately to reflect the original, suggesting an intentional choice to maintain visual fidelity. The brightness of the red is enhanced slightly due to the flat, graphic nature of the keychain design, which often uses saturated colors for clarity and appeal.",

      "question": "Does the dress retain the visible openwork crochet pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress is represented in a simplified, cartoonish style typical of keychain designs. While the overall shape and texture of the dress resemble the original, the fine details such as the openwork crochet pattern are not clearly visible. In contrast, in Image A, the dress features a distinct lace-like, perforated pattern that is characteristic of crochet work. In Image B, the texture appears more uniform and lacks the intricate holes and stitches seen in the original. Therefore, while the general aesthetic is preserved, the detailed crochet pattern is lost in the stylization process.",

      "question": "Are white socks visible beneath the red boots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is shown wearing white socks that extend above the ankle and are clearly visible just below the top edge of the red boots. This matches the detail observed in Image A, where white socks are also present under the boots. The keychain version maintains this element, even though it is stylized. The white color contrasts sharply with the red boots and the skin tone, making the socks easily identifiable. This suggests that the designer intended to preserve this specific detail from the original image.",

      "question": "Is a small rectangular label visible on the side of the left boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left boot (from the viewer's perspective) displays a small rectangular label near the top, just below the opening. This label is white with black text, consistent with the branding typically found on rubber boots like Hunter boots. In Image A, a similar label is visible on the actual boots, confirming that this feature was intentionally included in the keychain design. The presence of this label in both images indicates attention to brand detail, even in a simplified form.",

      "question": "Is a silver-colored buckle present on the upper part of the right boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right boot (from the viewer's perspective) features a small, metallic-looking buckle on the outer side near the top. This buckle is rendered in a silver or light gray color, matching the appearance of the real buckle in Image A. The buckle is a functional and decorative element commonly found on such boots, and its inclusion in the keychain suggests an effort to replicate authentic details. The position and design are consistent with the original, indicating accurate representation.",

      "question": "Is the figure bent forward at the waist with hands positioned near the ankles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted in a bent-forward pose, with the torso angled downward and the hands placed close to the ankles. This posture mirrors the stance seen in Image A, where the person is leaning forward, likely adjusting their boots. The keychain design captures this dynamic pose effectively, maintaining the curvature of the spine and the positioning of the arms. The alignment of the body parts—such as the angle of the legs and the placement of the hands—confirms that the pose is accurately represented, even in a simplified format.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red boots are shown extending well below the hem of the white dress, which ends above the knees. The boots reach mid-calf, clearly surpassing the dress hem. This is consistent with the original image (Image A), where the same spatial relationship exists between the dress and boots. The keychain preserves this proportionality, ensuring that the boots appear longer than the dress, which is a defining visual feature of the outfit. The relative lengths are maintained despite the stylization, indicating careful attention to detail.",
