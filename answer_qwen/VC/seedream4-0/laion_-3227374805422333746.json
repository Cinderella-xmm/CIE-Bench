      "question": "Does the edited image retain the original three-section gabled roof structure with a central tower and two side wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house maintains a complex roof structure composed of multiple gabled sections. The central part rises higher than the flanking sections, forming a distinct tower-like element. The left and right wings each have their own sloped roofs, creating a symmetrical layout consistent with a three-section design. This configuration matches the architectural style seen in many medieval or fantasy-style buildings where a central tower is flanked by lower wings. The visual cues—such as the alignment of rooflines, ridge lines, and the placement of dormer windows—confirm that the overall roof structure has not been altered in form or arrangement. Comparing to typical architectural representations, this setup aligns with traditional timber-framed houses with gabled extensions.",

      "question": "Are the two diamond-shaped glowing windows located on the upper level of the central tower in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper level of the central tower features two windows with a diamond-shaped frame, both emitting a warm yellow glow. These windows are symmetrically placed on either side of the central vertical axis of the tower, consistent with the positioning observed in similar structures. Their placement directly corresponds to the upper section of the tower, which is the highest point of the building. Given the lighting effect and shape, these appear to be decorative yet functional elements, typical of fantasy or game-inspired architecture. There is no indication of repositioning or distortion; they remain aligned with the structural symmetry of the tower.",

      "question": "Is the stone chimney still present on the left side of the roof, extending upward from the left wing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a gray stone chimney is clearly visible on the left side of the roof, emerging from the left wing's roofline. It is constructed of stacked stone blocks and extends vertically above the roof, consistent with its function as a ventilation structure for an internal fireplace. Its location matches the position seen in typical rustic or medieval-style homes where chimneys are placed on one side of the roof for smoke extraction. The chimney’s material and form suggest durability and integration into the building’s design, and it remains unaltered in placement or structure compared to expected norms.",

      "question": "Is the stack of wooden logs still positioned beside the right arched doorway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a neatly stacked pile of wooden logs is visible next to the right arched doorway, resting on the ground. The logs are arranged horizontally, suggesting they are stored for fuel or construction use. This placement is logical in a rural or fantasy setting, where firewood is commonly kept near entrances. The size and positioning of the log pile match what would be expected for practical storage without obstructing the doorway. No changes in location or orientation are evident, indicating the feature remains intact.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a wooden barrel is indeed suspended from a metal bracket attached to the exterior wall near the right arched doorway. The barrel is cylindrical, made of staves bound by metal hoops, and hangs at a slight angle, consistent with typical hanging methods used in old-world or fantasy settings. Such barrels are often used for storing liquids like wine, water, or ale, and their placement near a doorway suggests accessibility. The bracket appears sturdy and integrated into the wall, confirming the barrel is securely mounted and in its original position.",

      "question": "Do the two arched doorways on the ground floor retain their original positions and arch shapes (one open, one closed)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two arched doorways on the ground floor: one on the left and one on the right. Both maintain rounded arch shapes, characteristic of traditional masonry construction. The left doorway appears open, revealing a glimpse of the interior, while the right one is closed with a wooden door featuring horizontal planks. Their positions relative to the building’s facade and surrounding features (like the logs and barrel) confirm they have not shifted. The architectural consistency and symmetry support the conclusion that both doorways retain their original placements and forms.",

      "question": "Are the two small green potted plants still visible on the exterior walls, one on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two small green potted plants are visible—one on the left side of the building and one on the right—mounted on the exterior walls near the eaves. Each plant is housed in a simple pot and appears to be climbing or trailing slightly. These elements add to the rustic charm and liveliness of the structure, common in fantasy or game environments to suggest habitation and care. Their presence on both sides maintains balance and aesthetic symmetry. There is no sign of removal or relocation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, diagonal wooden beams are clearly visible at the corners where the roof overhangs meet the walls. These beams extend outward from the main structure, forming triangular supports that reinforce the roofline and contribute to the timber-framed architectural style. They are consistent in appearance with traditional half-timbered construction, where such beams serve both structural and decorative purposes. Their presence is confirmed by their placement at each corner of the overhanging roof sections, matching the design principles of such buildings.",
