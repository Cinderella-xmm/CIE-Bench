      "question": "Does the edited image retain the vibrant purple color of the subject's hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair is clearly depicted in a vibrant purple hue, consistent with the original color seen in Image A. The purple tone is vivid and uniformly applied across the hair strands, which aligns with the visual characteristics of the original image. This suggests that the editing process preserved the intended hair color. The style of the hair remains similar—short, wavy, and shoulder-length—further supporting continuity in appearance. Based on visual analysis and common understanding of digital editing practices where color retention is often prioritized for recognizable features, it is reasonable to conclude that the vibrant purple color was retained.",

      "question": "Are the gold hoop earrings still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is wearing gold hoop earrings, which are visible in both ears. These earrings match the style and placement seen in Image A, where they were also gold hoops. Despite the transformation into a stylized, cartoon-like character, the earrings have been preserved in both form and position. This indicates that the editor maintained key accessories from the original image, likely to preserve identity or continuity. Given that accessories like earrings are often retained in digital transformations unless intentionally removed, their presence here supports continuity with the original.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is wearing a black sleeveless top, which matches the attire seen in Image A. The top has a round neckline and no sleeves, consistent with the original clothing. Although the overall image has been transformed into a 3D animated style, the clothing remains visually identical in cut and color. This suggests that the editor preserved the outfit as part of the subject’s identifiable traits. In digital art transformations, clothing is often kept consistent to maintain recognition of the subject, especially when the focus is on character representation rather than fashion change.",

      "question": "Does the subject maintain a neutral expression and direct gaze in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's expression has changed significantly compared to Image A. While Image A shows a neutral, serious expression with a direct gaze, Image B depicts a stylized character with a wide, cheerful smile and bright eyes. The facial features are exaggerated and cartoonish, typical of animated avatars. The gaze is still forward-facing, but the emotional tone has shifted from neutral to friendly. Therefore, while the direction of the gaze is preserved, the expression is no longer neutral. This transformation reflects a common practice in character design where emotions are enhanced for visual appeal or narrative purposes.",

      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the subject's natural skin tone and general proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's skin tone has been altered to appear more uniform and lighter, with a smooth, almost plastic-like texture typical of 3D animated characters. The proportions have also been modified—features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth are enlarged and stylized, deviating from natural human proportions. This is characteristic of cartoon or avatar-style rendering, where realism is sacrificed for expressive clarity. In contrast, Image A presents a realistic depiction with natural skin texture and accurate proportions. Thus, while some aspects like hair color and clothing are preserved, the natural skin tone and proportions are not maintained in the edited version.",
