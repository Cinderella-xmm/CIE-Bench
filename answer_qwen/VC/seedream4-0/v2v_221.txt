    "Question": "Q1: Is the large black patch on the left shoulder of the cow present and clearly defined?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cow is stylized in a cartoonish, toy-like design. The left shoulder area (from the viewer's perspective) shows a black patch, but it is not as large or sharply defined as one might expect in a realistic cow. Instead, the black marking is smaller, rounded, and appears more like a simplified spot rather than a large, clearly defined patch. This is consistent with the artistic style of the image, which prioritizes cute, exaggerated features over anatomical accuracy. Therefore, while there is a black patch, it is not large or clearly defined in the way typical of real cows.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a continuous white stripe running down the center of the cow’s face from the forehead to the snout?",
    "explanation": "Observing the cow’s face in Image B, the facial structure is cartoonified. There is a white area running down the center of the face, starting from the forehead and extending toward the snout. However, due to the stylized nature of the cow, this white area is not perfectly straight or continuous—it has slight irregularities and soft edges. Nevertheless, the central white region is clearly present and follows the general path from the top of the head to the nose, aligning with common depictions of Holstein-type cows. Given that the goal is to assess presence and continuity, and considering artistic simplification, the stripe can be considered continuous enough to satisfy the description.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the cow’s horns curved upward and outward, with a light base and dark tips?",
    "explanation": "The cow in Image B has two horns that are clearly visible. They curve upward and slightly outward, which is consistent with typical bovine horn morphology. The base of each horn is light-colored (beige or cream), and the tips appear darker, possibly due to shading or intentional color variation. This gradient from light to dark is plausible in both real cows and stylized representations. The curvature and coloration match the described characteristics, even within the cartoon aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the television have a speaker grille on the right side and multiple control knobs at the bottom?",
    "explanation": "The television in Image B is a retro-style CRT model. On its right side, there is a vertical rectangular grille pattern, which is characteristic of a speaker grille. At the bottom front edge of the TV, several small circular buttons or knobs are visible—these resemble the control knobs found on older televisions. Their placement and appearance are consistent with standard design elements of vintage TVs. Therefore, both features are present and accurately depicted.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are both front hooves of the cow positioned on top of the television screen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cow is leaning forward with its front legs resting on the television. The hooves are clearly placed directly on the top edge of the TV screen, with both front paws visible and touching the surface above the screen. This positioning suggests the cow is interacting with the TV, likely for comedic or whimsical effect. The visual evidence confirms that both hooves are indeed on the television screen.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the background composed of a green grassy field under a blue sky with white clouds?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a vibrant green grassy field that extends across the lower portion of the image. Above it, the sky is bright blue with scattered fluffy white clouds. These elements are typical of an idealized pastoral scene and are rendered clearly and consistently. The lighting and colors suggest a sunny day, reinforcing the natural outdoor setting. Thus, the background matches the description exactly.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Is the cow’s nose pinkish-brown with clearly visible nostrils?",
    "explanation": "The cow in Image B has a prominent nose that is predominantly pink with subtle brown shading around the edges, giving it a pinkish-brown appearance. The nostrils are clearly defined as two distinct oval openings on the nose, visible and well-rendered despite the cartoon style. This detail is consistent with both realistic animal anatomy and stylized depictions where key features are emphasized for clarity and expression. Therefore, the nose meets the criteria described.",
    "answer": "Yes"
