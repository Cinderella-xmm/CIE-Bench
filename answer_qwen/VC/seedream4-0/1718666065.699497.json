      "question": "Is there at least one horn present on the forehead of the unicorn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn is clearly depicted with a single, spiraled horn protruding from its forehead. The horn is metallic in appearance and positioned centrally on the head, which is consistent with the traditional depiction of a unicorn. This visual cue, combined with world knowledge that unicorns are mythological creatures defined by their single horn, confirms the presence of a horn. There is no ambiguity in the image regarding the horn's existence.",

      "question": "Does the subject have four legs arranged in a horse-like stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a statue of a unicorn standing on all four legs. The legs are proportionate and positioned in a way that mimics a natural equine stance—two front legs and two back legs supporting the body. The posture is stable and balanced, typical of a horse or horse-like creature. Based on visual inspection and general anatomical knowledge of horses, this arrangement confirms a horse-like stance.",

      "question": "Is the unicorn positioned in a three-quarter view facing toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn is viewed from a perspective where both the left side of its body and part of its front are visible. Its head is turned slightly to the right, and the body orientation suggests it is facing toward the right side of the frame. This angle is characteristic of a three-quarter view, which shows more than half but not the full profile. Therefore, the positioning matches a three-quarter view facing right.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible dark, oval-shaped eye on the side of the unicorn's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close examination of Image B, the unicorn has a clearly defined eye on the side of its head. The eye is dark in color, oval in shape, and positioned in a realistic manner consistent with equine anatomy. The lighting highlights the eye’s contours, confirming its visibility. This aligns with typical representations of animal eyes in sculptures and art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the unicorn's head slightly turned toward the viewer, showing part of the left side of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The unicorn’s head in Image B is angled such that the left side of its face is partially visible to the viewer. While the main focus is on the right-facing profile, the slight turn of the head allows for a glimpse of the left cheek and eye area. This subtle rotation indicates that the head is indeed turned toward the viewer, revealing part of the left side. This observation is supported by standard principles of perspective and anatomical representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the unicorn have a broad, muscular body with a high-set head and arched neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the unicorn with a well-defined, broad torso and a strong, rounded musculature that suggests power and grace. The neck is curved upward in an arching fashion, leading to a head that is elevated relative to the body, indicating a high-set head. These features are common in idealized representations of horses and mythical creatures like unicorns, emphasizing elegance and strength. The sculpture’s design reflects these characteristics accurately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the front legs positioned slightly forward, with the back legs supporting the body's weight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front legs of the unicorn are placed slightly ahead of the back legs, which is typical for a standing equine posture. The back legs appear to be bearing more of the body’s weight, as they are aligned directly beneath the hindquarters. This distribution of weight is consistent with natural balance in quadrupedal animals. The positioning suggests stability and readiness, reinforcing the idea that the back legs support the body while the front legs are advanced.",
