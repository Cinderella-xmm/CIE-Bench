    "Question": "Q1: Is the subject's face shown in profile with a visible beard and mustache?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted in a side profile view, facing to the right. The facial features are clearly visible, including a well-defined beard and mustache. The artistic style, which resembles an oil painting with thick brushstrokes, still preserves enough detail to confirm the presence of facial hair. The beard is dark and neatly trimmed, extending from the chin and jawline, while the mustache is visible above the upper lip. This aligns with typical representations of African men in traditional attire, where such grooming is common. The profile view allows for clear observation of these features without obstruction.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the djembe drum present with a visible wooden body, tension ropes, and drumhead?",
    "explanation": "The image shows a drum positioned between the subject’s legs, consistent with the shape and structure of a djembe. The drum has a wide, rounded wooden body that tapers toward the base, characteristic of traditional West African djembes. The top surface is covered by a drumhead made of animal skin, which appears slightly textured and stretched. Around the rim of the drumhead, black tension ropes are clearly visible, running vertically and securing the head to the body—this is a hallmark feature of djembe construction. These elements are rendered in a painterly style but remain identifiable due to their distinct shapes and positions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the distinct geometric patterns (including sunbursts and stripes) visible on the subject’s clothing?",
    "explanation": "The subject is wearing a vibrant, patterned garment that includes multiple geometric designs. Upon close inspection, there are repeating motifs such as radiating lines resembling sunbursts, particularly noticeable on the chest and sleeves. Horizontal and vertical stripes in various colors (red, blue, yellow, and orange) also dominate the fabric. These patterns are typical of traditional West African textiles like kente or bogolanfini. Although the image is painted with expressive brushwork, the patterns remain distinguishable due to their bold contrast and regular repetition. The artist has preserved the essence of the design despite the stylized rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the subject seated on a block with hands raised above the drum in a drumming pose?",
    "explanation": "The subject is seated on a low, rectangular block that appears to be made of stone or wood. His posture is upright, and his hands are positioned above the drum, palms slightly open and fingers extended, suggesting a moment just before striking the drumhead. This hand position is consistent with a typical drumming stance, especially when playing a djembe rhythmically. The dynamic positioning of the hands indicates motion and intent, reinforcing the idea that he is actively engaged in drumming. The block serves as a stable seat, allowing proper leg placement for balance during performance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are distant hills and scattered acacia trees visible in the background?",
    "explanation": "The background of Image B features a landscape dominated by warm yellow and orange hues, indicative of a savanna or desert environment. In the distance, rolling hills are faintly visible beneath a hazy sky, contributing to a sense of depth. Scattered across the terrain are silhouettes of trees with flat, spreading canopies—characteristic of acacia trees commonly found in African savannas. While the painting style abstracts some details, the overall composition and forms strongly suggest these natural elements. The use of light and color enhances the impression of an expansive, arid landscape typical of sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the subject wearing a multicolored turban with visible folds and matching patterns?",
    "explanation": "The subject wears a headwrap that is tightly wound around the head, forming a turban-like shape. It is composed of rich, multicolored fabric featuring reds, yellows, blues, and oranges, with intricate patterns that echo those on the clothing. The folds of the fabric are clearly defined through variations in tone and brushstroke direction, indicating how the material drapes and wraps. The patterns include geometric shapes and possibly symbolic motifs, consistent with traditional African textiles. The turban complements the outfit both in color and design, reinforcing cultural authenticity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a backlight effect creating a golden silhouette around the subject's head and shoulders?",
    "explanation": "Although the image is painted in a highly expressive style, there is a strong light source emanating from behind the subject, casting a glowing outline along the edges of his head and shoulders. This effect creates a halo-like glow, particularly noticeable around the top of the turban and the back of the neck. The warm, golden tones of the background enhance this backlighting, giving the impression that the sun is setting behind him. This visual technique emphasizes the subject’s form and adds dramatic emphasis, reminiscent of cinematic or artistic lighting used to highlight figures against a bright backdrop.",
    "answer": "Yes"
