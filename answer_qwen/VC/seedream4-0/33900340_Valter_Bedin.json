      "question": "Is the central archway positioned at the center of the main structure, forming a passageway between the two vertical pillars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure is a colossal humanoid robot-like figure, not an architectural gateway. The 'central archway' described in the question does not exist in this image. Instead, the figure has a large, open chest cavity with glowing symbols, and no archway or passageway is present. The structure is symmetrical but not composed of vertical pillars flanking an archway. Therefore, the concept of a central archway between two pillars is entirely absent. This conclusion is based on visual analysis: there are no architectural elements resembling an archway or gate; instead, the form is mechanical and anthropomorphic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two vertical pillars standing symmetrically on either side of the central archway, forming a tall, narrow gateway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a giant robotic figure with arms extending outward and legs standing wide apart. There are no vertical pillars or a central archway as described. The structure is not a gateway but a massive statue-like entity. The symmetry is present in the figureâ€™s limbs and body, but it does not resemble architectural pillars flanking an arch. The idea of a 'tall, narrow gateway' is inconsistent with the image content. Therefore, the description does not match the visual evidence.",

      "question": "Are the battlements along the top of the structure composed of repeating rectangular merlons and gaps (crenels)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the structure in Image B features a crown-like element with pointed spires, resembling a helmet or headpiece rather than traditional battlements. There are no repeating rectangular merlons and crenels visible. Battlements are typically found on medieval fortifications, which are not present here. The design is more futuristic or mythological, with stylized elements that do not follow the architectural pattern of battlements. Thus, the presence of true battlements is denied by visual inspection.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a long, low brick wall running parallel to the main structure on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left side of the frame shows open landscape with grass and a path leading toward the giant figure. There is no visible low brick wall or any masonry structure running parallel to the main subject. The environment is natural and open, contrasting with the urban or fortified setting implied by a brick wall. The absence of such a wall is evident from the unobstructed view of the ground and horizon on the left side.",

      "question": "Is there a paved pathway extending from the foreground toward the central archway, running between the low wall and the main structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a winding path leading toward the base of the giant figure, but there is no low wall on the left side of the path. The path appears to be unpaved or made of earth and stone, not clearly paved. Moreover, since there is no central archway or low wall adjacent to the path, the full description fails. The path exists, but it does not run between a low wall and a main structure with an archway. Hence, the scenario described does not match the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there additional arched openings visible to the right of the main central archway, integrated into the same wall structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no central archway in Image B. The main structure is a humanoid robot, not a wall with arches. While the figure has openings (e.g., in the chest), these are not architectural archways. On the right side, there are no visible arched openings or wall structures. The entire composition lacks any indication of multiple arches or a continuous wall with such features. Therefore, the presence of additional arched openings is not supported by the visual data.",

      "question": "Is the small human figure located on the pathway, positioned behind the viewer and moving toward the central archway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a glowing, ethereal figure on the path near the base of the giant robot. However, this figure is not a typical human and appears translucent or spectral. It is positioned ahead of the viewer, facing the robot, not behind the viewer. Additionally, there is no central archway for the figure to be approaching. The direction of movement is ambiguous due to the glowing effect, but the figure is not behind the viewer. The spatial relationship described in the question does not align with the visual evidence.",
