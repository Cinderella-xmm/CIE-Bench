      "question": "Is the key-shaped symbol with swirling arms and central knob present on the leftmost book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom shelf features a series of books constructed from LEGO-like bricks. The leftmost book on this shelf is composed of stacked blocks with a distinct design on its spine. Observing closely, the design includes a circular motif with swirling arms radiating outward and a central knob-like element, resembling a stylized key. This matches the description of a key-shaped symbol with swirling arms and a central knob. The visual cues—such as the symmetrical swirls and central dot—are consistent with such a symbol. Therefore, based on the visual details and common symbolic representations, the symbol is indeed present.",

      "question": "Is the spiral motif clearly visible on the central book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central book on the bottom shelf in Image B is made of LEGO-style bricks and has a carved design on its spine. Upon inspection, this design consists of an intricate spiral pattern that winds inward toward a central point. The spiral is well-defined and occupies most of the book's face, making it clearly visible. Spiral motifs are often used in decorative art to represent continuity or growth, and here the design is rendered with sufficient clarity and detail to be unmistakable. Thus, the spiral motif is clearly present.",

      "question": "Is the flowing vine-like pattern present on the rightmost book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the rightmost book of the bottom shelf in Image B, the design appears to be a continuous, curving line that mimics the organic flow of a vine. It starts from one side and elegantly curls around, forming loops and tendrils characteristic of botanical patterns. This visual structure aligns with the definition of a vine-like pattern. Given that such patterns are commonly used in ornamental designs to suggest nature and fluidity, and the image shows a clear representation of this style, the presence of the vine-like motif is confirmed.",

      "question": "Are the interlacing Celtic knotwork patterns present on the top panel and vertical side frames of the bookshelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top panel of the bookshelf displays a complex, interwoven design composed of continuous lines that loop and cross over each other—a hallmark of Celtic knotwork. Similarly, the vertical side frames feature repeating geometric patterns with interlocking elements that resemble traditional Celtic designs. These patterns are not random but follow the characteristic symmetry and endless-loop structure typical of Celtic art. Even though the medium is LEGO-like, the design intent and visual structure match known examples of Celtic knotwork. Hence, these patterns are present.",

      "question": "Are the three large books with detailed carvings positioned side by side on the bottom shelf, from left to right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the bottom shelf of Image B, there are three prominent books in the center, each larger than the surrounding ones and featuring detailed carvings. From left to right, the first has a key-shaped symbol, the second a spiral motif, and the third a vine-like pattern. These three are adjacent and aligned horizontally, forming a visually balanced trio. Their size and placement distinguish them from the smaller books around them, confirming they are positioned side by side in sequence. This arrangement is intentional and clearly depicted.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the middle and upper shelves in Image B, several books display carved designs on their spines. On the second shelf from the bottom, there is a book with a spiral motif. On the third shelf, another book features a vine-like pattern. On the fourth shelf, a book with a key-shaped carving is visible. Additionally, on the fifth shelf, there is a book with a Celtic knot design. These four distinct carved books are spread across the middle and upper shelves. Each carving is clearly defined and visible, satisfying the condition of having at least four such books. Therefore, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Are the books and structural elements rendered in earthy tones such as brown, tan, and muted red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette of Image B consists primarily of warm, natural hues. The books and structural components are built using LEGO-like bricks in shades of brown, tan, beige, and muted reddish-brown. These colors are consistent with earthy tones, evoking materials like wood, clay, or aged leather. The lighting enhances the depth of these colors without introducing bright or unnatural contrasts. This choice of color scheme aligns with the aesthetic of vintage or classical library decor, reinforcing the impression of warmth and antiquity. Therefore, the rendering uses earthy tones throughout.",
