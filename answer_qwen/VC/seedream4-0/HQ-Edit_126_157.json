      "question": "Is the elderly man’s long white beard and mustache clearly visible and present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man is depicted as a wooden carving within a framed display. The beard and mustache are intricately carved with fine detail, showing individual strands that mimic the texture of hair. Despite being a sculpture, the facial hair is clearly defined and extends downward from the chin and above the upper lip, consistent with a long white beard and mustache. The material (wood) and craftsmanship allow for high visibility of these features, even though they are not real hair. Based on visual cues and common knowledge about woodcarving techniques, such details are often emphasized to convey character traits like age and wisdom. Therefore, the beard and mustache are clearly visible and present in the artwork.",

      "question": "Is the wide-brimmed conical straw hat positioned on the man’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is wearing a hat that closely resembles a traditional East Asian conical straw hat, commonly known as a 'coolie hat' or 'straw hat.' It has a wide brim and a pointed top, typical of such designs used for sun protection. In this case, the hat is part of the wooden carving and is properly placed on the man’s head, covering the top and sides of his skull. The structure and positioning match the expected placement of such a hat in cultural depictions. Although it is made of wood rather than actual straw, its form and placement are accurate to the original design. Thus, the hat is correctly positioned on the man’s head.",

      "question": "Is the man seated cross-legged in the center of the boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the posture of the carved figure in Image B, the man's legs are bent at the knees with one foot resting near the other, but they are not crossed over each other in a typical cross-legged fashion. Instead, he appears to be sitting in a semi-squatting or kneeling position, with both feet planted on the boat floor. This is a common posture for rowing or balancing in small boats. The legs are symmetrically arranged, but not crossed. Given the nature of the sculpture and the physical constraints of carving, it may not perfectly replicate a cross-legged pose. However, based on the visual evidence, the legs are not crossed. Therefore, the man is not seated cross-legged.",

      "question": "Is the oar held horizontally across the man’s lap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the oar is depicted as a wooden rod extending diagonally from the man’s hands toward the front of the boat. It is not positioned horizontally across the lap but rather angled forward, suggesting it is being used to row or steer. The grip is firm, and the oar rests on a support beam in the boat, which is consistent with how an oar would be held during use. A horizontal position would imply the oar is idle or resting across the lap, which is not the case here. The angle and orientation suggest active use rather than passive placement. Hence, the oar is not held horizontally across the lap.",

      "question": "Are the wooden planks of the boat clearly visible and arranged in a linear fashion along the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boat is constructed from wood, and the planks forming the interior surface are visible. They are arranged in parallel lines running lengthwise along the hull, consistent with traditional boat construction methods. Each plank shows distinct grain patterns and separations, indicating individual pieces joined together. The linear arrangement is clear and deliberate, contributing to the structural realism of the carved scene. Even though the boat is part of a sculptural diorama, the planking is accurately represented. Therefore, the wooden planks are clearly visible and arranged linearly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boat is not actually floating on water. Instead, it is part of a framed wooden sculpture displayed on a glass platform, with a painted background depicting water and mountains. The surface beneath the boat is transparent glass, and there are no ripples or reflections suggesting actual water. The water in the background is a flat, stylized representation, not a real surface. Therefore, while the scene suggests a lakeside setting, the boat is not physically floating on a calm water surface—it is mounted as part of a decorative piece. Thus, the answer is no.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a painted landscape with layered mountain silhouettes rendered in soft blue tones, creating a sense of depth and atmospheric haze. These mountains are stylized but clearly depict a misty, distant terrain typical of traditional East Asian landscape art. The use of gradient shading and blurred outlines mimics the appearance of fog or mist, enhancing the illusion of distance. Although the mountains are not real but painted, they are visually represented as misty and situated behind the water-like surface. Therefore, misty mountains are indeed visible in the background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is dressed in a robe carved from wood, which has a rich, dark brown coloration consistent with aged or stained wood. The garment is loose-fitting, with broad sleeves that drape naturally over the arms. The folds in the sleeves are clearly carved, showing creases and contours that suggest fabric movement. These details reflect the artist’s effort to simulate realistic clothing through carving techniques. While not actual cloth, the robe's appearance matches the description of a dark brown, loose-fitting robe with visible sleeve folds. Thus, based on the visual representation and artistic interpretation, the answer is yes.",
