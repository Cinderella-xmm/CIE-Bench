    "Question": "Q1: Is the eagle’s head white?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eagle is depicted as a sculptural figure under a glass dome. The head of the eagle clearly shows a white plumage covering the top and back of the head, which is characteristic of a bald eagle. This white coloration contrasts sharply with the dark brown body and wings, and matches the known appearance of adult bald eagles. The visual details, such as the texture and shading, support the conclusion that the head is indeed white. This aligns with real-world knowledge that mature bald eagles have distinctive white heads.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the eagle have a yellow beak with a hooked tip?",
    "explanation": "Observing the eagle in Image B, the beak is prominently visible and has a bright yellow coloration. Its shape is distinctly curved downward at the tip, forming a hook—this is a hallmark feature of raptors like the bald eagle, used for tearing prey. The beak's structure and color are consistent with biological traits of bald eagles. There is no ambiguity in the visual evidence; the beak is both yellow and hooked.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the tail feathers white and fanned out?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the eagle is clearly visible and appears to be white, matching the typical coloration of a bald eagle's tail. The feathers are spread slightly, suggesting a fanned-out posture, which is common during flight or display. While the fan is not fully open as it might be in mid-flight, the slight splay and white coloration confirm this detail. This observation is consistent with the natural anatomy of bald eagles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the body of the eagle primarily dark brown?",
    "explanation": "The body of the eagle in Image B is rendered in rich, dark brown tones, especially on the back and wings. Although there are decorative gold leaf accents applied artistically (likely for aesthetic effect), the underlying base color of the body remains dark brown. This aligns with the natural coloration of a bald eagle’s body, which is dark brown in adults. The artistic embellishments do not change the fundamental color classification.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the wings fully extended upward and outward in a soaring pose?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eagle’s wings are shown in a dynamic position: they are raised high and spread wide, with the tips pointing upward and outward. This posture mimics the soaring behavior of an eagle in flight, where wings are fully extended to catch thermals. The sculpture captures this motion accurately, even though it is static. The angle and curvature of the wings suggest a gliding or soaring pose, consistent with natural avian flight mechanics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the eagle have a visible yellow eye?",
    "explanation": "The eagle’s eye in Image B is clearly visible and colored yellow with a dark pupil. This matches the known eye color of bald eagles, which typically have sharp, yellow eyes. The level of detail in the sculpture allows for this feature to be observed, and its placement and hue are consistent with real biology. No occlusion or distortion prevents visibility of the eye.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the wings show layered feather patterns with darker tips and lighter bases?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the eagle exhibit a detailed, layered structure resembling individual feathers. Each feather appears to have a darker tip and a lighter base, creating a gradient effect that enhances realism. This pattern is biologically accurate for bald eagles, whose wing feathers often darken toward the ends. Even though the sculpture includes gold accents, the underlying feather layering and tonal variation are evident and consistent with natural anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the overall silhouette of the eagle consistent with a bald eagle in mid-flight?",
    "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B captures the essential silhouette of a bald eagle in flight: broad wingspan, white head and tail, dark body, and streamlined form. The pose—with wings uplifted and body angled forward—resembles a soaring eagle. Despite being enclosed in a glass dome and stylized with artistic elements like gold leaf and clouds, the core proportions and shape remain true to a real bald eagle in flight. This consistency is supported by comparative knowledge of bird anatomy and avian flight postures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
