    "Question": "Q1: Does the Funko Pop-style figure wear the same uniform and helmet as the original player?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop-style figure is depicted wearing a gray baseball uniform with navy blue accents, including a matching navy blue helmet. This outfit closely resembles the uniform worn by the batter in Image A, who also wears a gray uniform with dark blue or black sleeves and a black helmet. The design elements such as the color scheme, helmet style, and uniform cut are consistent between the two figures. While Funko Pop figures often stylize real-world characters, they typically aim to preserve key visual identifiers like team colors and equipment. Therefore, based on visual cues and common practices in collectible figurines, it is reasonable to conclude that the Funko Pop figure maintains the same uniform and helmet style as the original player.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the Funko Pop-style figure holding a baseball bat?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop-style figure is clearly shown holding a wooden baseball bat in its right hand, positioned in a batting stance. The bat is proportionally scaled to match the figure’s size, which is typical for Funko Pop designs. This aligns with the character's identity as a baseball player. There is no ambiguity in the visual representation—the bat is present and held in a manner consistent with the character’s role. Thus, based on direct observation of the image, the answer is affirmative.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the Funko Pop-style figure maintain a similar posture to the original player while holding the bat?",
    "explanation": "The original player in Image A is captured mid-swing, with a dynamic, athletic stance—body twisted, legs apart, and bat raised in preparation to hit the ball. In contrast, the Funko Pop-style figure in Image B stands upright in a static pose, holding the bat in a ready position but not actively swinging. While both figures hold the bat, the posture differs significantly: the original player exhibits motion and tension, whereas the Funko Pop figure has a simplified, stylized, and static pose characteristic of the Funko Pop design aesthetic. Therefore, although the action is thematically similar (batting), the actual posture is not maintained.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a baseball depicted near the Funko Pop-style figure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a small white baseball with red stitching is visible inside the product box, placed on the base near the Funko Pop figure. It is not physically attached to the figure but is included as part of the display within the box. This is a common practice in Funko Pop releases, where accessories like balls or gloves may be included to enhance the theme. Although the baseball is not held by the figure, it is clearly present in close proximity within the packaging. Thus, based on visual evidence, the answer is yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the catcher's protective gear visible in the product box scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the product box features an image of the Funko Pop figure standing inside the display window. The figure is dressed in a baseball uniform and holding a glove, but there is no indication of catcher's protective gear such as shin guards, chest protector, or mask. The figure does not resemble a catcher, nor does the box art suggest any such equipment. Furthermore, the figure outside the box is holding a bat, reinforcing its identity as a batter rather than a catcher. Based on this analysis, catcher's protective gear is not visible in the product box scene.",
    "answer": "No"
