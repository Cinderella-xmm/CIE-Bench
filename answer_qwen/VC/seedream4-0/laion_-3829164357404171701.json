      "question": "Is the large dark gray ribbon bow still present and positioned on the front-left side of the bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large dark gray ribbon bow is indeed visible and appears to be positioned on the front-left side of the bag, just as in the original image. The bow's placement is consistent with its position in Image A, and it remains intact despite the addition of a fantastical creature emerging from the bag. The bow’s structure and orientation are preserved, indicating no significant change in its location or presence. This conclusion is based on visual confirmation of the bow’s shape, color, and spatial relationship to the bag.",

      "question": "Is the white artificial flower still visible and centered within the large gray ribbon bow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white artificial flower is clearly visible in Image B and is centered within the large gray ribbon bow, just as it was in Image A. The flower’s placement has not shifted, and it maintains its role as a decorative focal point within the bow. Despite the surreal addition of a dragon-like creature, the flower remains undisturbed and fully visible, suggesting that the editing process preserved this detail. The flower's texture and positioning relative to the bow confirm its continuity.",

      "question": "Is the small gray ribbon bow with a white flower still attached to the right handle by a silver chain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small gray ribbon bow with a white flower is still present and attached to the right handle via a silver chain. The chain is visibly connected between the bow and the handle, and the bow retains its form and placement. Although the bag now contains a fantastical creature, the small bow and chain remain unaltered in their configuration. This consistency suggests that the edit did not interfere with this specific decorative element.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silver chain is clearly visible in Image B, extending from the small gray ribbon bow to the right handle of the bag. The chain’s links are discernible, and there is no indication of breakage or disconnection. Its appearance matches that in Image A, confirming that the connection remains intact. Even with the addition of the dragon-like creature, the chain’s path and attachment points are preserved, demonstrating continuity in the object’s design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bag’s body in Image B remains cream-colored and retains the woven basket shape with distinct horizontal ridges. These features are consistent with those in Image A. The texture and coloration of the bag have not changed, and the structural form is preserved despite the presence of the dragon-like creature. The ridges are still visible and evenly spaced, indicating that the bag’s physical characteristics have not been altered by the editing process.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beige satin interior lining is still visible in Image B through the top opening of the bag. The fabric appears smooth and consistent with the material seen in Image A. The lighting and angle of the image allow for clear observation of the interior, confirming that the lining has not been removed or obscured by the added elements. The presence of the creature does not block the view of the interior, maintaining visibility of the satin lining.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B remains a white brick wall with a flat white surface beneath the bag, matching the setting in Image A. The texture of the bricks and the clean, minimalist surface are unchanged. The lighting and shadows suggest that the environment has not been modified, even though a fantastical creature has been added to the scene. This indicates that the background was preserved during the editing process.",

      "explanation": "The text “JourFin LoveRibbon®” is still visible in the bottom-right corner of Image B, just as it was in Image A. The font, style, and placement are identical, and there is no sign of alteration or removal. The logo is clearly legible and positioned consistently, suggesting that it was intentionally retained as part of the branding. The presence of the dragon-like creature does not obscure or affect the visibility of the text.",
