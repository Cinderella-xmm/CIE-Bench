      "question": "Does the edited image retain exactly three arms—one central and two lateral—arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the candelabra features three distinct arms extending from a central column. One arm is positioned centrally at the top, and two additional arms extend outward to the left and right. These arms are arranged in a balanced, symmetrical fashion around the vertical axis of the structure. The central arm is directly above the base, while the lateral arms curve outward and upward in a mirrored fashion. This configuration matches the description of one central and two lateral arms arranged symmetrically. Based on visual inspection, there are no extra or missing arms, and their placement appears intentional and balanced. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Are the left and right arms symmetrically positioned and shaped relative to the central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the left and right arms exhibit mirror symmetry with respect to the central vertical axis of the candelabra. Both arms have identical curvature, length, and orientation, curving outward and upward from the central stem in a smooth, consistent arc. Their shapes are nearly identical, and they are positioned equidistant from the central axis. This bilateral symmetry is typical in decorative objects designed for aesthetic balance. There are no visible distortions or asymmetries in their form or placement. Thus, the arms are symmetrically positioned and shaped.",

      "question": "Is the base circular, flared, and adorned with a beaded or ridged edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B is clearly circular in shape and slightly flared outward, providing stability to the structure. It has a wide, flat surface that tapers slightly toward the center where the central stem connects. Upon close inspection, the outer edge of the base features an embossed floral pattern with delicate leaf and vine motifs, which may resemble a decorative ridge or beading. However, it does not appear to have a continuous beaded or ridged edge like a traditional ornamental border. Instead, the decoration is more intricate and sculpted rather than uniformly ridged. Therefore, while the base is circular and flared, it lacks a clear beaded or ridged edge as described. The answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Does the central stem remain a tall, tapering vertical shaft connecting the base to the top arms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central stem is indeed a tall, vertical shaft that extends from the base to the upper section where the arms originate. It maintains a consistent cylindrical form with a slight tapering effect, becoming narrower as it rises toward the top. The stem is straight and serves as the primary structural support for the arms. While it is not perfectly tapered (it has a uniform thickness for most of its length), it still functions as a vertical shaft connecting the base to the arms. The presence of a label wrapped around the middle suggests it may be a product design element, but this does not affect its role as a central shaft. Thus, the description holds true.",

      "question": "Do the arms maintain smooth, curved trajectories from the central stem to the top ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms in Image B exhibit smooth, flowing curves as they extend from the central stem to the top ends. Each arm follows a gentle S-shaped trajectory, starting from the central shaft, curving outward, then upward toward the crystal-like candle holders. The curvature is consistent and uninterrupted, without sharp angles or irregularities. This smoothness contributes to the elegant and modern aesthetic of the candelabra. The transition from the stem to the arm and then to the top is seamless, indicating careful design. Therefore, the arms do maintain smooth, curved trajectories.",
