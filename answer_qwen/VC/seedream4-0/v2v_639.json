      "question": "Does the giraffe retain its distinctive brown patches outlined in cream?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe is constructed from LEGO bricks and features a pattern of brown patches separated by cream-colored lines, which mimics the natural coat pattern of a real giraffe. The design accurately reflects the typical reticulated appearance seen in giraffes, where irregular brown polygons are outlined by lighter, cream-colored lines. This pattern is consistent with the biological characteristics of Giraffa camelopardalis (commonly known as the giraffe). Although it is a stylized representation due to the blocky nature of LEGO, the essential visual feature—the brown patches outlined in cream—is preserved. Therefore, based on visual cues and world knowledge of giraffe anatomy, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Is the person depicted with extended hands toward the giraffe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO minifigure representing the person has one arm raised and bent at the elbow, with the hand positioned near the giraffe’s neck. The other arm is slightly lowered but also appears to be reaching out. While the articulation is limited by the nature of LEGO figures, the pose suggests an interaction where the person is extending their hands toward the giraffe. This matches the general posture of someone engaging with or feeding an animal. Comparing this to typical human-animal interactions, such as at a zoo, people often extend their hands when offering food or greeting animals. Thus, the depiction aligns with the idea of extended hands.",

      "question": "Are the person and giraffe positioned close together, maintaining their original relative distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model shows the person standing directly beside the giraffe, with minimal space between them. The proximity is consistent with the interaction seen in Image A, where the keeper stands very close to the giraffe, almost touching it. In both images, the positioning emphasizes a personal, interactive moment. The scale of the LEGO figures is proportionally accurate to the original scene, and they are placed side-by-side within the display case, preserving the closeness observed in the original. This spatial arrangement maintains the intended narrative of a caretaker interacting closely with the animal, even though the medium has changed from real-life photography to a LEGO model. Hence, the relative distance is maintained.",

      "question": "Does the giraffe retain its long neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO giraffe in Image B clearly features a long neck, composed of multiple stacked pieces that extend upward from the body. This construction accurately reflects the anatomical trait of real giraffes, which have elongated necks made up of seven cervical vertebrae—just like most mammals—but each significantly longer. Despite being built from modular bricks, the neck's length is exaggerated appropriately to match the iconic silhouette of a giraffe. The visual cue of height and extension from head to body confirms that the long neck is preserved in the LEGO version. Therefore, based on both visual evidence and biological knowledge, the giraffe retains its long neck.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO minifigure is wearing a uniform consisting of a shirt, pants, and cap, all of which are uniformly colored in a shade of light blue. This matches the attire seen in Image A, where the zookeeper is dressed in a similar light blue outfit. The choice of color is consistent across both representations, suggesting intentional fidelity to the original image. Light blue is commonly used in uniforms for zookeepers or park rangers, possibly for visibility and professionalism. The LEGO model faithfully reproduces this detail, using the same hue to represent the uniform. Thus, the person's uniform is indeed depicted in light blue.",
