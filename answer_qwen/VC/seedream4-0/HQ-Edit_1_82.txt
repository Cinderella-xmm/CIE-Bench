    "Question": "Q1: Is the “GIOROUR” logo clearly visible on the balance beam?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the balance beam is depicted in a stylized, illustrated format. The central panel shows a gymnast standing on the beam, and the beam itself has a black oval plaque with text on it. Upon close inspection, the text appears to read 'GIOROUR', which matches the logo mentioned in the question. The font style and placement are consistent with branding typically seen on gymnastics equipment. Although the image is cartoonish, the letters are legible and clearly spelled out.

    "Question": "Q2: Is the gymnast positioned with both feet firmly on the surface of the balance beam?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central illustration shows the gymnast standing upright on the balance beam. Both feet are placed flat on the beam's surface, with no indication of imbalance or movement. The posture suggests stability, and the positioning of the feet aligns with standard gymnastic form when balancing.

    "Question": "Q3: Is the blue floor mat visible beneath the balance beam?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the balance beam is shown resting on a blue support structure.

    "explanation": "In Image B, the central gymnast’s hair is tied up in a neat bun at the top of her head. A small red accessory is visible securing the bun, consistent with a hair tie. This is a common hairstyle for gymnasts during competition to keep hair secure. The red color is distinct against the dark hair, making it easily identifiable. Based on visual cues and typical gymnastic attire, the description matches the image.",

    "Question": "Q7: Does the balance beam rest on two blue support legs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the balance beam is supported by two distinct blue structures at either end. These supports are angled and connected to the beam, forming a stable base. The design is consistent with standard balance beam setups in gymnastics, where two legs provide balance and support. The blue color matches the floor mat and is typical for such equipment. Thus, the beam rests on two blue support legs.",

There is no dark blue wall, nor any mention of 'Giptorht' or a green circular emblem. This contrasts with Image A, which features such elements, but in Image B, these details are absent.
