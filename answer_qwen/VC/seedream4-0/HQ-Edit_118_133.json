      "question": "Is the complex scrollwork and floral engraving pattern visible on the body, lid, and spout of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a teapot-shaped candle holder with intricate detailing. The body features elaborate embossed scrollwork and floral patterns that are clearly visible, consistent with ornate decorative design styles often seen in fine porcelain or ceramic art. These patterns extend to the lid and spout as well, where similar raised designs can be observed. The lighting enhances the relief of these engravings, making them stand out against the smooth surface. This level of detail is typical of high-end decorative items, especially those designed for aesthetic appeal rather than purely functional use. Based on visual cues and common knowledge of decorative craftsmanship, the presence of such patterns across multiple parts of the object is confirmed.",

      "question": "Does the object have a domed lid topped with a small finial at the apex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the top of the object appears flat rather than domed. Instead of a rounded lid with a finial (a small decorative knob or ornament), it has an open top where a candle wick protrudes from a glass container. This indicates that the 'lid' is not a traditional cover but rather part of the candle's structure. There is no visible finial or dome-like shape on top. In contrast, many classic teapots do feature domed lids with finials, but this object has been repurposed into a candle holder, altering its original form. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and understanding of object function, the answer is no.",

      "question": "Is the object supported by a three-legged pedestal base with decorative feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object rests on a wide, circular base that is integrated into the lower portion of the body. It does not have distinct legs or a three-legged pedestal structure. Instead, the base is a single, stable platform with a subtle flared design and floral motifs around its edge. There are no visible feet or separate support elements extending downward. This contrasts with traditional metal teapots that often have tripod-style bases. Given the object’s design as a candle holder, a solid, flat base would be more practical for stability. Thus, based on visual inspection and functional reasoning, the object lacks a three-legged pedestal base.",

      "question": "Is there a curved handle attached to the left side of the object, extending upward and backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a prominent handle is visible on the left side of the object. It curves gracefully upward and then backward, forming a C-shape that is typical of teapot handles. The handle is made of a material resembling gold or gilded metal, with ornamental detailing at the joint where it connects to the body. Its curvature allows for comfortable grip and ergonomic handling. This design aligns with common teapot aesthetics and functional ergonomics. Even though the object is now a candle holder, the handle retains its original form and placement. Therefore, based on visual observation and design logic, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Is there a long, curved spout extending from the right side of the object’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clearly defined spout on the right side of the object. It extends outward and curves slightly upward, characteristic of a traditional teapot spout. The spout is smooth and elegantly shaped, continuing the decorative theme with subtle engraved patterns along its length. While the object is no longer used for pouring liquid, the spout remains intact and visually consistent with classical teapot design. The positioning and curvature suggest it was originally designed for fluid flow, which matches standard teapot engineering. Thus, based on both visual evidence and functional design principles, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Is the object placed on a polished wooden surface with a clear reflection visible beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object sits on a dark, richly grained wooden surface that exhibits a high gloss finish. A distinct reflection of the object is visible directly beneath it, indicating the surface is highly polished and reflective. The clarity of the reflection includes details such as the handle, spout, and base, confirming the smoothness and shine of the wood. This type of surface is commonly used in product photography to enhance visual appeal and emphasize elegance. The reflection adds depth and realism to the composition, reinforcing the luxurious feel of the scene. Therefore, based on visual cues and photographic conventions, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Are there decorative metal fittings where the handle attaches to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the junction between the handle and the body of the object features ornate detailing. Specifically, there is a gold-colored metallic fitting at the attachment point that includes scrollwork and a small knob-like element, suggesting intentional decorative embellishment. This fitting appears to be both structural and aesthetic, serving to secure the handle while enhancing the overall design. Such fittings are common in luxury teapots or decorative vessels to add visual interest and durability. The contrast between the white ceramic body and the golden metal accent emphasizes the craftsmanship. Therefore, based on visual analysis and knowledge of decorative object design, the answer is yes.",
