        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue car located in the upper left position of the car carrier is visually identifiable as blue. The color remains consistent with the original hue seen in Image A, despite the overall stylized and cartoonish transformation of the scene. The car's body retains a solid blue tone, and no visual cues suggest a change in color. This conclusion is based on direct observation of the car’s surface coloration, which matches the expected blue shade. While the image has been edited to include anthropomorphic features (like faces), the base color remains unchanged.",

      "question": "Does the red car in the upper middle position retain the compact sedan body shape with a sloped roofline and four doors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red car in the upper middle position appears to maintain the general compact sedan silhouette, including a sloped roofline and four visible doors. However, due to the cartoonish and exaggerated style of the edit, some proportions are altered—such as the oversized wheels and simplified body contours. Despite these stylistic changes, the fundamental body shape remains consistent with a compact sedan. Compared to Image A, where the car has a more realistic design, Image B preserves the core structural form but simplifies it for animation-like aesthetics. Thus, while not perfectly realistic, it retains the essential characteristics described.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can count the number of cars on the car carrier. On the upper deck, there are four cars: blue, red, yellow, and green. On the lower deck, there are four cars: red, blue, orange, and another red one. This totals eight cars. Although the cars are stylized with cartoon faces and exaggerated features, their individual identities are distinct and separable. There is no overlap or merging of vehicles that would reduce the count. Comparing this to Image A, which also shows eight cars (four on each level), the total number remains unchanged. Therefore, the count of eight cars is preserved in the edited version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The yellow car in the upper middle-right position in Image B is clearly rendered in yellow. Despite being stylized with facial features (eyes, cheeks, smile), its primary body color remains yellow. The color consistency is maintained across the entire vehicle, and no parts appear to have changed hue. This aligns with the original yellow color seen in Image A. The artistic transformation does not alter the base color; instead, it adds playful elements while preserving the original palette. Thus, the car is still yellow.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, every car visible on the carrier appears to have four wheels: two at the front and two at the rear. This is consistent with standard automobile design. Even though the cars are stylized with cartoonish proportions (e.g., larger wheels, simplified shapes), all exhibit four wheels arranged in the typical configuration. No car is missing wheels or has an abnormal number. This matches real-world automotive engineering principles and is also consistent with Image A, where all cars have four wheels. The edit maintains this fundamental attribute despite the artistic liberties taken.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red car in the lower right position in Image B is indeed red, maintaining the same base color as in Image A. It also retains the compact sedan body shape, including a sloped roofline and four-door configuration, although the design is simplified and stylized. The cartoon-like rendering includes large eyes and a smiling face, but the overall silhouette remains consistent with a compact sedan. Compared to Image A, where the car is more realistically proportioned, Image B preserves the core form while adding whimsical elements. Thus, both color and shape are retained.",
