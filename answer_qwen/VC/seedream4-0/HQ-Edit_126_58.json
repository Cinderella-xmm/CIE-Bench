      "question": "Is the neck of the swan-shaped object still curved in an elegant S-shape, extending upward and backward from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object is no longer a solid swan sculpture but a perfume bottle designed with a swan motif. The swan’s neck is now part of the decorative design on the label, not a physical sculpted neck. The actual physical form of the bottle does not have a long, curved neck extending from the body like a real swan. Instead, it features wing-like glass structures on the sides and a straight, rectangular body. Therefore, while the concept of a swan is present, the neck is not physically curved in an S-shape as it would be in a traditional swan sculpture. This conclusion is based on visual inspection of the bottle's structure and comparison to typical swan anatomy.",

      "question": "Are the pink berry-like accents visible on the evergreen sprigs surrounding the base of the swan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the object (the perfume bottle) is surrounded by decorative evergreen sprigs arranged in a circular pattern. Upon close inspection, small pink berry-like elements are indeed visible among the greenery, interspersed with red and green beads. These resemble festive holiday decorations commonly used in winter-themed displays. The presence of these pink accents matches the description in the question. This observation is supported by visual details consistent with typical Christmas or winter decor aesthetics.",

      "question": "Is there a white snowflake-shaped ornament located near the base of the swan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, near the base of the perfume bottle, there is a clearly visible white, intricately shaped ornament resembling a snowflake. It is placed among the evergreen sprigs and pink berries, enhancing the wintry theme. The snowflake is symmetrical and has multiple arms, characteristic of a stylized snowflake decoration. This is consistent with common winter holiday decorations and aligns with the overall aesthetic of the scene. Therefore, the presence of such an ornament can be confirmed visually.",

      "question": "Is the swan/bottle resting on a textured, snow-covered surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle is placed on a surface that appears to be covered in snow. The texture of the surface shows fine granular detail typical of fresh snow, with soft ridges and unevenness suggesting depth and coldness. This snowy ground provides a thematic contrast to the glass bottle and enhances the winter atmosphere. Based on visual cues such as color, texture, and lighting reflections, this surface is clearly intended to represent snow. Thus, the object rests on a textured, snow-covered surface.",

      "question": "Are there blurred figures of people walking in the background under strings of colorful, glowing lights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features several indistinct human silhouettes, which appear blurred due to shallow depth of field. These figures are dressed in winter clothing and seem to be moving, suggesting they are walking. Above them, numerous strings of colorful lights—red, blue, yellow, and pink—are strung across the scene, creating a festive bokeh effect. This setup is typical of a holiday market or outdoor winter event. The combination of blurred people and glowing lights supports the interpretation of a lively, festive environment in the background.",

      "question": "Is the head of the swan-shaped object oriented toward the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swan motif is represented on the label of the perfume bottle. The swan illustration on the label is facing toward the right side of the image, not the left. While the original swan sculpture in Image A might have had its head turned leftward, the swan depicted here is a graphic element on the bottle's front label, and its orientation is clearly to the right. This determination is based on analyzing the direction of the swan’s neck and beak in the holographic-style image on the label. Therefore, the head is not oriented toward the left.",
