      "question": "Is the full white beard present on the figure’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure has a neatly trimmed, short beard and mustache that are dark in color, consistent with natural aging but not white. There is no visible full white beard. The facial hair is limited to a well-groomed goatee and sideburns, typical of 19th-century European aristocratic fashion. Based on visual cues and historical context, this style does not include a full white beard. Therefore, the presence of a full white beard is not accurate.",

      "question": "Is there a red or dark tilak mark positioned between the eyebrows on the forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a man in Western attire, specifically a top hat and formal suit, set against an English landscape with a manor house. The cultural context suggests a European nobleman from the 1800s. There is no visible mark on the forehead. A tilak is a traditional Hindu marking worn by some individuals in South Asia, typically applied during religious or ceremonial occasions. Given the attire, setting, and lack of any such marking, it is clear that no tilak is present. This conclusion is supported by both visual inspection and cultural context.",

      "question": "Is the figure displaying an open-mouthed smile showing teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B has a closed mouth with a neutral or slightly pleasant expression. The lips are gently closed, and no teeth are visible. This is consistent with formal portraiture styles of the 19th century, where subjects often maintained composed, dignified expressions rather than overt smiles. The absence of visible teeth and the relaxed yet reserved facial expression confirm that this is not an open-mouthed smile.",

      "question": "Is the figure standing upright with arms relaxed at the sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is standing upright, with one hand placed in his pocket (a common pose in classical portraits) and the other hanging loosely by his side. While the posture is upright and balanced, the arm placement is not fully relaxed at the sides—specifically, the right hand is tucked into the coat pocket, which is a deliberate pose indicating formality. Thus, while the body is upright, the arms are not entirely relaxed at the sides due to the pocket-hand positioning. This reflects a conventional portrait stance rather than a completely relaxed posture.",

      "question": "Is the figure shown in full-body view and centered in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is depicted from approximately mid-thigh upward, so it is not a full-body view. The lower part of the legs and feet are not visible. Additionally, the figure is centered within the composition, with symmetrical framing and balanced background elements. However, since only the upper half of the body is visible, the image does not constitute a full-body view. This partial framing is typical of many classical portraits, where emphasis is placed on the torso and face.",

      "question": "Are the natural skin tone and facial texture (including wrinkles) preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B displays realistic skin tones and facial features consistent with oil painting techniques of the 19th century. Wrinkles around the eyes, forehead, and mouth are subtly rendered, suggesting age and natural texture. The brushwork captures fine details such as skin folds and subtle shading, preserving the appearance of natural facial texture. This level of detail indicates that the artist aimed for realism, including the preservation of natural skin characteristics. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and artistic conventions of the time, the natural skin tone and texture are preserved.",
