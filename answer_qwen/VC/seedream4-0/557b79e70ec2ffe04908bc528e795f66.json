      "question": "Is the mustache present and shaped in a way that matches the original image, with a curved, thick form extending from both sides of the upper lip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is a plush toy resembling Albert Einstein. The facial features are stylized and simplified, with no visible mustache. Instead, the face has a smooth, rounded appearance with small, black button-like eyes and a simple stitched smile. There is no indication of a mustache, let alone one with a curved, thick form. This contrasts sharply with the original image (Image A), where Einstein’s iconic mustache is clearly visible and prominent. The absence of a mustache in Image B is consistent with the design choices typical for a plush toy, which prioritize cuteness and simplicity over realistic facial details. Therefore, based on visual evidence and common knowledge about plush toys, the mustache is not present.",

      "question": "Does the hair retain its wild, voluminous, and unevenly distributed white appearance, particularly with strands extending outward from the sides and top of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy has a tuft of white, fluffy material on its head that mimics Einstein's wild hair. While it is white and somewhat spiky, it is more uniformly styled and less voluminous than the actual hair in Image A. The hair in Image A is characterized by its chaotic, unkempt nature, with strands sticking out in multiple directions, especially at the sides and top. In contrast, the plush toy's hair is neatly arranged into a spiky, upward-pointing style, which is stylized rather than realistic. Although it captures the general idea of 'wild' hair, it lacks the natural irregularity and volume seen in the original. Thus, while the intention to replicate Einstein's hair is evident, the execution does not fully match the original in terms of realism or distribution.",

      "question": "Are there vertical black stripes running down the front of the sweater, matching the pattern seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy is wearing a sweater that features vertical black lines running down the front. These lines are evenly spaced and appear to be stitched or embroidered, giving them a distinct, decorative look. However, in Image A, Einstein is wearing a dark sweater with no visible vertical stripes—his sweater appears plain and unadorned. The stripes in Image B are an artistic addition, likely included to add visual interest or to mimic the texture of knitwear in a stylized manner. Since the original sweater lacks such stripes, the presence of these vertical lines in Image B represents a creative deviation rather than a faithful reproduction. Therefore, the pattern does not match the original.",

      "question": "Is a portion of a light-colored shirt collar visible beneath the sweater’s neckline, aligned with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy has a sweater with a high neckline, but there is no visible collar underneath. The neck area is smooth and continuous, without any indication of a separate shirt or collar. In contrast, in Image A, Einstein is wearing a collared shirt under his sweater, and a portion of the light-colored collar is visible at the neckline. This detail is preserved in the original photograph but omitted in the plush toy design, likely due to the simplification required for a stuffed toy. The absence of a visible collar in Image B means this feature does not align with the original image.",

      "question": "Do the eyes, nose, and forehead lines maintain their original relative positions and shapes, such as the horizontal creases on the forehead and the oval shape of the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are highly stylized. The eyes are represented by two small, round black buttons, placed symmetrically on the face, lacking the detailed structure and depth of human eyes. There is no visible nose, only a stitched line forming a smile. The forehead is smooth and rounded, with no horizontal creases or wrinkles present in Image A. In the original image, Einstein’s forehead shows pronounced horizontal lines due to age and expression, and his eyes are oval-shaped with visible detail. The plush toy’s face is designed to be cute and cartoonish, so anatomical accuracy is sacrificed for aesthetic appeal. As a result, the relative positions and shapes of the facial features do not match the original.",

      "question": "Is the sweater’s neckline and shoulder area textured with ribbed patterns consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sweater worn by the plush toy has a knitted texture, particularly noticeable around the neckline and shoulders. The ribbed pattern is visible and consistent with the style of a hand-knit garment. However, in Image A, Einstein’s sweater also appears to have a ribbed texture, though it is less distinct due to the photograph’s resolution and lighting. The key difference lies in the level of detail: while both sweaters share a similar general texture, the plush toy’s sweater is more exaggerated and uniform in its knitting pattern, possibly for stylistic or manufacturing reasons. Despite some similarity, the exact consistency of the ribbed pattern cannot be confirmed as identical, and the overall texture is more stylized in the toy version. Therefore, while there is a resemblance, the texture is not perfectly consistent with the original.",
