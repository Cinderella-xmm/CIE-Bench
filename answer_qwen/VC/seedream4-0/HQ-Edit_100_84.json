      "question": "Are there exactly three triangular sails attached to the dhow, arranged in a staggered vertical line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dhow clearly features three large triangular sails. These sails are positioned along the mast in a staggered vertical arrangement, with each sail slightly offset from the one below it. This configuration is typical of traditional Arabian dhows, which often use multiple lateen sails for efficient wind capture. The sails are also decorated with intricate blue and gold patterns, further emphasizing their distinct design. Based on visual inspection, there are no additional sails, confirming that the count is exactly three. The staggered alignment allows for optimal balance and maneuverability in traditional sailing vessels.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dhow have a wooden hull with visible arched windows and decorative lattice railings along the upper deck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dhow's hull constructed from dark wood, consistent with traditional Arabian shipbuilding techniques using teak or similar durable hardwoods. Along the sides of the upper deck, there are clearly visible arched windows, which are characteristic of ornate dhow designs, especially those used for luxury or ceremonial purposes. Additionally, the railing along the deck features intricate lattice work, likely carved or inlaid, reflecting Islamic geometric art styles. These details align with historical and cultural knowledge of Arabian maritime architecture, where both functionality and aesthetics were emphasized.",

      "question": "Is the dhow oriented diagonally across the frame, with its bow pointing toward the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dhow in Image B is positioned diagonally within the composition, with its bow (front) pointing toward the upper right corner of the image. This diagonal orientation creates a dynamic sense of movement and direction, suggesting forward motion across the water. The angle of the hull relative to the horizon line confirms this diagonal placement. This positioning is common in artistic renderings to convey motion and depth, and it matches the visual cues such as the tilt of the sails and the reflection beneath the hull.",

      "question": "Are there multiple small sailboats visible on the horizon in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several small sailboats can be seen on the horizon in the distance, particularly to the left and center-right of the frame. These boats appear as silhouettes against the glowing sky, consistent with the lighting conditions during sunset. Their presence adds depth to the scene and suggests a bustling maritime environment. While they are not detailed, their shapes—triangular sails and elongated hulls—are recognizable as other dhows or similar vessels. This detail enhances the narrative of a maritime journey and supports the theme suggested by the title 'Mystic Arabian Dhow Journeys'.",

      "question": "Is the sun located low on the left side of the image, casting a bright golden reflection across the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sun in Image B is positioned low on the left side of the frame, near the horizon, indicating either sunrise or sunset. This placement produces a strong golden glow across the sky and a bright, shimmering reflection on the water surface extending from the left toward the center. The warm color palette—yellows, oranges, and soft golds—further confirms the time of day. The reflection is clearly visible as a luminous path on the water, enhancing the dramatic atmosphere of the scene. This lighting setup is consistent with natural solar behavior at dawn or dusk.",

      "question": "Is there a visible wake and reflection of the dhow beneath its hull on the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear reflection of the dhow’s hull beneath it on the water surface, particularly noticeable due to the calmness of the sea and the reflective quality of the water under the golden light. However, there is no distinct wake trailing behind the vessel. A wake typically appears as disturbed water with ripples or waves caused by the boat’s movement, but here the water remains relatively smooth and undisturbed. Therefore, while a reflection is present, a visible wake is absent. This could suggest the dhow is moving slowly or the scene is stylized to emphasize serenity rather than motion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dhow in Image B features a prominent, elongated bow that extends forward from the main hull. This pointed design is characteristic of traditional Arab dhows, which were built for speed and stability in open waters. The bow is sleek and curves upward slightly, aiding in cutting through waves. Its length and shape are clearly visible, extending beyond the main body of the ship. This design element is both functional and symbolic, often associated with elegance and maritime heritage in the region.",
