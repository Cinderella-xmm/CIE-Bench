      "question": "Are the carrots depicted in a bright orange color with their rounded-tapered shape preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots are clearly visible and exhibit a vibrant orange hue, which is characteristic of mature carrots. Their shape is rounded at the top and tapers slightly toward the bottom, consistent with the typical morphology of cultivated carrots. The visual cues show no distortion or unnatural elongation, and the proportions appear realistic. This observation aligns with common knowledge about carrot appearance—bright orange and tapered—and confirms that the shape and color have been preserved accurately in the image.",

      "question": "Are the carrots topped with bright green serrated leaves with a lobed appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foliage on the carrots in Image B displays bright green leaves with distinct serrated edges and a lobed structure, typical of carrot tops (also known as carrot greens). These leaves are feathery and segmented, matching the botanical characteristics of Daucus carota. The vivid green color and detailed leaf structure suggest healthy growth, which is consistent with real carrot plants. There is no indication of artificial coloring or deformation, reinforcing that the depiction is accurate based on world knowledge of carrot plant anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the soil texture surrounding the carrots’ roots preserved showing they are rooted in soil rather than snow or ice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the carrots are surrounded by snow in Image B, the immediate area around their bases shows dark, rich soil with visible clumps and granular texture, indicating that the roots are planted in soil. This soil patch is isolated within the snowy environment, suggesting an intentional planting scenario—possibly for artistic or symbolic effect. While the surrounding environment is snowy, the root zone itself remains in soil, preserving the natural rooting condition. Thus, despite the unusual setting, the soil texture is preserved and clearly distinguishes it from snow or ice.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the carrots positioned in a way that shows they are partially underground, consistent with their natural growth pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower portions of the carrots are embedded in the soil, while the upper parts and leafy tops extend above ground. This partial submersion is consistent with how carrots grow naturally—buried in soil with only the crown and foliage exposed. The positioning reflects a realistic growth pattern where the taproot develops beneath the surface. Even though the scene is set in snow, the placement of the carrots in soil indicates they are growing in situ, maintaining their natural orientation and depth relative to the ground.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the carrots have visible surface textures like natural ridges or marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the carrots in Image B, fine horizontal ridges and slight surface imperfections are visible along their outer skin. These natural markings are typical of real carrots, resulting from growth patterns and environmental factors such as soil contact. The texture appears organic and not overly smooth or artificially rendered, supporting the authenticity of the depiction. Such details are consistent with world knowledge about the physical appearance of freshly harvested carrots.",
