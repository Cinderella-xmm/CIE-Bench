    "Question": "Q1: Does the guitar retain its teal color and circular sound hole?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar is clearly visible with a distinct teal-colored body. This color is consistent across the entire body of the guitar, including the edges and surface, which shows no signs of alteration or discoloration. The sound hole in the center of the guitar's body is circular in shape, as expected for an acoustic guitar, and is surrounded by a dark ring, typical of such instruments. Based on visual inspection and common knowledge of acoustic guitar design, the circular sound hole is a standard feature, and its presence here confirms that it has been retained. There are no indications of deformation or replacement with another shape. Therefore, both the teal color and the circular sound hole are preserved.",
    "answer": "yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there still six tuning pegs on the guitar's headstock?",
    "explanation": "Observing the headstock of the guitar in Image B, there are six tuning pegs visible—three on each side of the headstock. This configuration is standard for a six-string acoustic guitar, where each string corresponds to one tuning peg. The pegs appear evenly spaced and properly aligned, consistent with typical guitar construction. There is no evidence of missing or additional pegs, and their placement matches the expected layout for a standard acoustic guitar. Thus, based on both visual cues and general knowledge of guitar anatomy, the guitar retains six tuning pegs.",
    "answer": "yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the microphone still positioned near the guitar?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the microphone is mounted on a stand and placed to the right of the guitar, at a distance that suggests it is within range for capturing sound from the instrument. Its position relative to the guitar is similar to what would be used in a live performance or recording setup. The microphone is angled slightly toward the guitar, indicating intentional placement for optimal audio capture. This proximity and orientation confirm that the microphone remains near the guitar, fulfilling its functional role in a musical context. No significant shift in position or removal is observed.",
    "answer": "yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the amplifier still placed behind the guitar?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the amplifier is located directly behind the guitar, serving as a support against which the guitar leans. The guitar’s base rests against the front panel of the amplifier, which is consistent with how musicians typically position guitars during performances or photo setups. The amplifier’s size and placement suggest it is intended to be part of the same musical arrangement. This positioning is logical and practical, allowing the guitar to remain upright without additional support. Therefore, the amplifier remains in its original location behind the guitar.",
    "answer": "yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the guitar maintain its original leaning posture against the amplifier?",
    "explanation": "The guitar in Image B is leaning backward against the amplifier, with its neck extending upward and its body resting firmly against the amplifier's front. This posture is consistent with how acoustic guitars are commonly displayed or stored when not in use. The angle of the lean appears stable and balanced, suggesting that the guitar is supported by the amplifier in a way that prevents tipping. Comparing this to typical guitar display setups, this leaning posture is standard and functional. There is no indication of change in posture—such as being upright, horizontal, or tilted differently—so the original leaning position is maintained.",
    "answer": "yes"
