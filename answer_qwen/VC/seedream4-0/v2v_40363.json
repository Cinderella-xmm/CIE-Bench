        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child is depicted using a mosaic tile style, with each part of the figure composed of individual colored tiles. Despite this stylistic transformation, the overall silhouette and posture of the child remain consistent with the original depiction: the child is still shown in profile, facing right, with one arm extended toward the heart-shaped balloon. The head, body, and limbs maintain their relative proportions and orientation, suggesting that the core shape and position have been preserved, albeit in a different artistic medium. This conclusion is based on comparing the outline and pose of the child in both images, which aligns with common artistic interpretation where form is retained even when medium changes.",

        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The round red balloon in Image B appears to be rendered in a glossy, three-dimensional style, possibly as a physical object or a highly detailed tile representation. Its spherical shape is intact, and it remains positioned above the child’s head, just as in the original. The string connecting it to the child is also present and maintains its vertical alignment. While the texture and material appear altered due to the mosaic style, the balloon’s shape and placement relative to the child are consistent with the original image. This suggests that despite the change in medium, the essential visual elements of the balloon—its form and location—are preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The heart-shaped balloon in Image B is constructed from red tiles arranged in a heart form, with visible grout lines between them. However, the overall shape of the heart remains clearly recognizable and matches the original design. It is positioned to the right of the child, floating slightly above and in front of the wall, consistent with its placement in the original artwork. Although the surface texture has changed due to the mosaic technique, the heart’s outline and spatial relationship to other elements (like the child and the round balloon) remain unchanged. Therefore, both shape and position are effectively retained.",

      "question": "Does the child still appear to be reaching toward the heart-shaped balloon?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child’s right arm is extended forward, with the hand open and fingers pointing toward the heart-shaped balloon. This gesture is consistent with the original image, where the child reaches out in a hopeful or longing manner. Even though the child is now made of mosaic tiles, the directional intent of the arm and hand is preserved. The positioning of the arm relative to the heart-shaped balloon suggests continued interaction, reinforcing the narrative of reaching. Thus, despite the stylistic change, the action and implied emotion remain intact.",

      "question": "Are the relative positions of the child, the round red balloon, and the heart-shaped balloon maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial arrangement of the three key elements—the child, the round red balloon, and the heart-shaped balloon—mirrors that of the original image. The round red balloon is directly above the child’s head, attached by a string, while the heart-shaped balloon floats to the right and slightly ahead of the child. The child’s arm extends toward the heart-shaped balloon, maintaining the same dynamic relationship. Although the materials and textures differ (mosaic vs. painted), the composition and relative positions of these elements are preserved. This consistency ensures that the scene’s narrative and visual balance are retained across the two versions.",
