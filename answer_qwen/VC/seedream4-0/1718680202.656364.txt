    "Question": "Q1: Is the capybara’s fur visibly brown with detailed texture and fine hair strands?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara's fur appears to be a rich brown color. The texture is highly detailed, showing individual hair strands and natural fur patterns that give it a realistic, three-dimensional appearance. This level of detail suggests high-resolution rendering or digital enhancement, consistent with modern CGI techniques used in animated or stylized animal portrayals. The fur exhibits shading and depth, indicating attention to realism in texture modeling. Based on visual cues and common knowledge about digital artistry in character design, such detailing is intentional to enhance lifelikeness.",

    "explanation": "The capybara in Image B is indeed wearing a bright blue beanie. The knit pattern is clearly visible, with horizontal ribbing that mimics the texture of a real knitted hat.

The fingers are curled around the cup, with black claws clearly visible, indicating a firm grip.

    "Question": "Q5: Are the black sunglasses worn by the capybara displaying the word “SPY” on the temple?",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the sunglasses in Image B, the temple (the arm) of the glasses has text printed on it. While not immediately legible at first glance due to angle and lighting, the letters appear to spell 'SPY' in reverse, which is common for branding on eyewear when viewed from the front. Given that this is a stylized image and the font matches typical branding styles seen in fashion accessories, the presence of 'SPY' can be confirmed based on visual alignment and context. Additionally, the same label appears in Image A, confirming consistency across versions.",

However, its head is slightly rotated forward, giving a partial three-quarter view where the eye and part of the face are visible to the viewer.
