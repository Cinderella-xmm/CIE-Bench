      "question": "Is the pomegranate present and clearly identifiable as a red, round fruit with visible internal seeds, held in the hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is holding a small, round, red object in its right hand. The object has a smooth, glossy surface typical of a pomegranate, and there is a visible crown-like top that matches the natural structure of a pomegranate. However, the internal seeds are not visible, as the fruit appears whole and unopened. While it is clearly intended to represent a pomegranate based on shape and color, the internal seeds are not shown due to the stylized nature of the figurine. Therefore, while the fruit is identifiable as a pomegranate, the internal seeds are not visible.",

      "question": "Does the headscarf retain its golden-yellow base color with diagonal stripes in purple, blue, and red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The headscarf in Image B features a vibrant, multicolored striped pattern. The dominant base color is golden-yellow, consistent with the original image's theme. The stripes include colors such as red, blue, purple, and orange, arranged in diagonal bands across the scarf. These colors and patterns align closely with the description of the original headscarf, though the style is more stylized and cartoonish. The presence of these specific colors in diagonal stripes confirms the retention of the original design elements.",

      "question": "Is the left ear adorned with a silver earring featuring a red gemstone and dangling components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's ears are simplified and cartoonish, lacking detailed jewelry. There is no visible earring on the left ear or any other ear. The absence of any jewelry, including the described silver earring with a red gemstone and dangling parts, is clear due to the stylized and minimalistic design of the figurine. This contrasts with the original image, where intricate earrings were present. In this edited version, such details have been omitted entirely.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brown outer vest in Image B features decorative patterns along the collar and shoulder areas. These patterns include geometric designs with blue thread-like embroidery, consistent with traditional textile motifs. The blue detailing is clearly visible along the edges and seams, matching the description of embroidered blue accents. Although the style is stylized, the visual evidence supports the presence of blue embroidery in the specified locations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only the right hand is clearly visible and positioned around the pomegranate, forming a grip. The left hand is not visible in the frame; it appears to be behind or out of view. The figurineâ€™s design does not show both hands interacting with the fruit. Therefore, while one hand shows a clear grip, the other is not visible, making it impossible to confirm both hands being present in the grip.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right wrist is visible, but there is no bracelet present. The arm is bare except for the sleeve of the garment. The lack of any accessory on the wrist is consistent with the simplified design of the figurine, which omits fine details like jewelry. In contrast, the original image featured a silver bracelet, but this detail has been removed in the edited version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The inner garment beneath the brown vest in Image B is visible at the neckline and sleeves. It appears to be a light, creamy color, consistent with an off-white shade. The fabric is smooth and lacks any strong coloring or pattern, supporting the identification as off-white. While the material may differ slightly in texture due to the stylized nature of the figurine, the color remains consistent with the description.",
