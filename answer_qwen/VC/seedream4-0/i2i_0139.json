      "question": "Is the carrot still bright orange in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot is clearly visible and retains a vibrant orange hue. The color appears consistent with that of a fresh, healthy carrot, showing no signs of discoloration or fading. This brightness is typical of carrots grown under controlled conditions, such as in a hydroponic or lab environment, where lighting and nutrient levels are optimized for plant health. Based on visual inspection, the carrot’s color remains true to natural expectations.",

      "question": "Does the carrot maintain its conical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carrot in Image B displays a classic conical shape, tapering smoothly from the wider top near the green leaves to a narrower tip at the bottom. This shape is characteristic of mature carrots and is preserved here despite the change in environment. There are no deformities or irregularities in the structure, indicating that the shape has been maintained. This consistency aligns with biological expectations for healthy carrot development.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the green leaves still present at the top of the carrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the green leafy tops are clearly visible in Image B, extending upward from the crown of the carrot. These leaves appear lush and healthy, suggesting the carrot is either freshly harvested or actively growing. In natural conditions, carrot greens grow from the top of the root, and their presence here confirms that the entire plant structure is intact. The leaves' condition supports the idea that the carrot is well-maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tapered top end of the carrot with visible roots still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the base of the carrot in Image B, there is a clear transition from the main root to the soil or substrate, with fine root hairs visible along the lower portion. While the very tip of the carrot is not shown, the upper part (the crown) shows the typical tapering where smaller roots emerge. This detail matches what one would expect in a real carrot — the top end includes small lateral roots and a slightly rough texture. Thus, the tapered top end with visible roots is indeed present.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the carrot still positioned upright in the substrate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot is standing vertically on a metallic circular platform, which appears to be part of a high-tech growing system. Although it is not planted in soil like in a garden, it is still oriented upright, maintaining a vertical alignment. The positioning suggests intentional placement for display or cultivation purposes. Even though the substrate is artificial (possibly gravel or hydroponic medium), the carrot remains upright, fulfilling the spatial orientation expected in both natural and controlled environments.",
