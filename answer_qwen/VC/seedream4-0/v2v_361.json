      "question": "Does the keychain retain the dog's original fur pattern with a mix of dark and light tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain depicts a stylized, chibi version of a Yorkshire Terrier. The design features a distinct contrast between the light tan fur on the face, chest, and legs, and the darker black fur on the back and tail. This coloration is consistent with the typical fur pattern of a Yorkshire Terrier, which naturally has a combination of dark and light tones. The keychain uses these colors in a simplified but accurate representation, preserving the breed’s characteristic two-tone coat. Therefore, based on visual cues and world knowledge about Yorkshire Terriers, the keychain does retain the original fur pattern.",

      "question": "Is the chibi keychain oriented in a way that suggests it is looking toward the fire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi keychain is shown as a flat, two-dimensional object held in a person's hand. It is facing forward, directly toward the viewer, with its head turned slightly to the side but not angled toward any specific direction that would suggest it is looking at a fire. There is no fire or background context present in Image B—only a plain, neutral background. In contrast, Image A shows a real dog sitting and gazing toward a fire behind a pedestal. However, since Image B lacks any such environmental elements, the orientation of the keychain cannot suggest it is looking toward a fire. Thus, the keychain is not oriented in a way that implies it is looking at a fire.",

      "question": "Is the dark rectangular pedestal still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a close-up of a hand holding a keychain shaped like a Yorkshire Terrier. There is no visible structure resembling a dark rectangular pedestal in this image. The background is plain and light-colored, with no architectural or decorative elements. In contrast, Image A clearly includes a dark rectangular pedestal to the left of the dog. Since the keychain in Image B is isolated and presented against a simple backdrop, the pedestal from Image A is absent. Therefore, the dark rectangular pedestal is not present in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the background retain its dark, moody appearance with scattered orange sparks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a clean, neutral, off-white background with no visible texture, lighting effects, or particles. There are no orange sparks, flames, or dark atmospheric elements present. This contrasts sharply with Image A, which has a dark, moody environment illuminated by firelight and floating orange sparks, creating a dramatic and cinematic atmosphere. The keychain in Image B is displayed in a controlled, well-lit setting typical for product photography, which eliminates any moody or fiery background. Therefore, the background in Image B does not retain the dark, moody appearance or sparks seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the chibi keychain retain the dog's perked-up ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain depicts a cartoon-style Yorkshire Terrier with upright, pointed ears that are clearly defined and raised. This matches the typical physical trait of a Yorkshire Terrier, whose ears are erect and alert. The chibi design simplifies the features but maintains the perked-up ear shape, which is consistent with both the breed's natural anatomy and common artistic representations. Even though the style is exaggerated and stylized, the ears are distinctly upright, indicating they are 'perked up.' Thus, the keychain retains this characteristic feature.",
