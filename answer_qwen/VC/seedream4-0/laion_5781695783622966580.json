      "question": "Is the hat still a wide-brimmed bucket hat with a broad, outward-facing brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat retains the general silhouette of a bucket hat with a wide brim that extends outward from the crown. The brim is visibly broad and flat, consistent with the definition of a wide-brimmed hat. The structure appears to maintain the same proportions as a typical bucket hat, with the brim projecting horizontally around the head. Although the design has been altered—featuring an intricate geometric pattern in teal, silver, and gold—the fundamental shape remains consistent with a bucket hat style. Based on visual cues such as the width of the brim relative to the crown and the overall form, it can be concluded that the hat still qualifies as a wide-brimmed bucket hat.",

      "question": "Are the eyes, nose, and mouth in their original positions and shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features—eyes, nose, and mouth—are positioned in a natural alignment consistent with human anatomy. The eyes are symmetrically placed above the nose, which is centrally located, and the mouth is below the nose in a standard configuration. The shape of each feature appears anatomically accurate: the eyes have defined eyelashes and irises, the nose has a clear bridge and nostrils, and the lips are full and naturally curved. There is no visible distortion or warping that would suggest digital manipulation altering their positions or forms. Comparing to Image A (the original), the facial features appear identical in placement and shape, suggesting no significant changes were made to these elements. Therefore, the facial features remain in their original positions and shapes.",

      "question": "Does the hair retain its original light brown color and wavy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair exhibits a light brown hue with golden highlights, consistent with the appearance in Image A. The texture is clearly wavy, with soft curls and volume that follow the natural flow of the hair. There is no indication of color alteration or textural change such as straightening or frizzing. The waves are evenly distributed along the length of the hair, maintaining the same style seen in the original image. While the lighting may slightly affect perception, the overall color and texture remain faithful to the original. Thus, based on visual analysis and comparison with Image A, the hair retains its original characteristics.",

      "question": "Is the visible portion of the clothing a white sleeveless top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible portion of the clothing includes the upper chest and shoulder area, which shows a white garment without sleeves. The fabric appears smooth and lightweight, consistent with a sleeveless top. There are no visible patterns, colors, or textures that deviate from the plain white appearance seen in Image A. The neckline is simple and rounded, matching the style of a typical sleeveless top. Since there is no evidence of any change in color, cut, or design, and the garment aligns with the original, it can be concluded that the clothing remains a white sleeveless top.",

      "question": "Is the background a solid white with no additional elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is uniformly white across the entire frame, with no visible shadows, gradients, objects, or textures. It appears clean and uncluttered, providing a neutral backdrop that emphasizes the subject. This matches the background in Image A, where the setting is also a solid white studio background. There are no signs of digital artifacts, reflections, or added elements that would disrupt the uniformity. Given the consistency between both images and the absence of any visual distractions, the background in Image B is indeed a solid white with no additional elements.",

      "question": "Does the hat have a rounded crown with consistent height relative to the brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crown of the hat appears to be rounded and maintains a consistent vertical height relative to the brim. The top of the hat curves smoothly into the brim, forming a balanced silhouette typical of a bucket hat. The height of the crown does not appear exaggerated or compressed; instead, it proportionally supports the wide brim. Compared to Image A, where the hat had a similar structural balance, the edited version preserves this proportional relationship. Despite the decorative pattern and metallic trim, the underlying shape of the crown remains unchanged. Therefore, the hat retains a rounded crown with consistent height relative to the brim.",

      "question": "Is the lighting even and bright across the face and hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is uniformly distributed across the face and hat, with no harsh shadows or overexposed areas. The illumination highlights facial features clearly while maintaining soft transitions between light and shadow. The hat’s surface reflects light evenly, indicating consistent exposure. This evenness suggests professional studio lighting, similar to what is observed in Image A. There are no visible hotspots or dark patches that would indicate uneven lighting. The brightness level is sufficient to reveal fine details in both the skin tone and the hat’s design. Therefore, the lighting in Image B is even and bright across the subject.",
