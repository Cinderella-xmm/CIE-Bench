      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player's jersey prominently displays the number '55' in bold orange numerals with a white outline. The number is centered on the chest area of the black jersey, which is the standard placement for player numbers in basketball uniforms. The font style and size are consistent with typical athletic jersey designs, ensuring high visibility. This positioning aligns with real-world basketball jersey conventions, where the number is placed centrally on the front and back of the jersey. The clarity and correct placement are evident even under the stylized comic-book art style.",

      "question": "Is the basketball held in the player’s right hand, positioned near his waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basketball is indeed held in the player’s right hand. The ball is located just below the level of the player’s chest and slightly to the right side of his body, which corresponds to a position near the waist. This grip and positioning suggest a dribbling motion, consistent with dynamic play in basketball. The angle of the arm and the orientation of the ball indicate active control, typical of a player preparing to move or pass. The visual cues align with realistic basketball mechanics.",

      "question": "Is the player depicted in a forward-leaning, mid-dribble stance with bent knees and arms in motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The player in Image B is shown in a dynamic pose that reflects a forward-leaning posture, indicative of movement during a game. His knees are bent, suggesting he is either dribbling or preparing to make a move. The right arm is extended downward holding the ball, while the left arm is slightly bent and positioned for balance—consistent with a mid-dribble stance. The overall body language conveys momentum and action, typical of an athlete in motion during a basketball play. These elements collectively support the interpretation of a mid-dribble stance.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basketball hoop is clearly visible in the upper-left portion of the frame. It features a red rim and a white net, both of which are standard components of a regulation basketball hoop. The backboard is also present, though partially cropped. The design adheres to common basketball court aesthetics, and the positioning of the hoop relative to the player suggests it is part of the playing environment. The visual details confirm the presence of a properly rendered hoop.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a basketball court with distinct white boundary lines marking the edges of the playing area. Additionally, a curved white line, consistent with the shape of a three-point arc, is visible in the lower-right section of the court. Although only a portion of the arc is shown, its curvature and placement match the standard layout of a professional basketball court. These markings are essential for gameplay and are accurately represented in the stylized artwork.",

These facial features are clearly rendered despite the stylized comic-book aesthetic. The facial expression shows focus and intensity, typical of an athlete in action. The detail level allows for accurate identification of these grooming characteristics, which are consistent with common representations of athletes in sports media.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A dark, elongated shadow is visible directly beneath the player’s feet on the court surface in Image B. The shadow follows the silhouette of the player’s legs and shoes, indicating the direction of lighting from above. Shadows are commonly included in artistic renderings to enhance depth and realism, especially in dynamic scenes like this one. The presence of the shadow contributes to the perception of the player being grounded and in motion.",
