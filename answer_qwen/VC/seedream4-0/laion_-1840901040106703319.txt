    "Question": "Q1: Are the three triangular windows positioned at the apex of the A-frame roof clearly present and maintaining their triangular shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure at the apex of the roof is no longer a wooden A-frame with triangular windows. Instead, it is a large, faceted, gem-like structure made of reflective blue and green glass panels. The original triangular windows have been replaced by a complex geometric design composed of multiple polygonal facets, none of which resemble the original triangular windows. The overall shape is still pyramidal, but the individual triangular window elements are absent. This transformation suggests a complete redesign of the roofline, replacing functional architectural features with an artistic, crystalline form. Therefore, the original triangular windows are not present.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the cabin structured with a raised deck on the upper level and a garage on the lower level, maintaining the same vertical separation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure has undergone a radical transformation. While there is still a two-level appearance, the upper level now consists of a transparent, crystalline dome-like structure rather than a wooden deck. There is no visible railing or deck surface, and the lower level is entirely reimagined as a base for the crystal structure, with no indication of a garage or functional space beneath. The vertical separation between levels remains, but the functional layout (deck above, garage below) has been completely altered. The original structural purpose of the levels is lost in favor of an artistic installation. Thus, the original configuration is not maintained.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the garage door located on the right side of the lower level, adjacent to the main entrance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible garage door or any indication of a functional entrance on the lower level. The entire lower portion is a smooth, white marble platform supporting the crystal structure. The original garage door and main entrance from Image A are completely absent. The new design does not include any doors or openings that could be interpreted as a garage or entrance. Therefore, the garage door is not present, let alone located on the right side.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the cabin symmetric about its central vertical axis, with the roof peak, main entrance, and supporting columns aligned centrally?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure maintains a strong sense of symmetry. The crystalline pyramid is perfectly centered, with its apex directly above the midpoint of the base. The reflections and facets are evenly distributed around the central axis, suggesting intentional symmetry in the design. Although there are no visible columns or entrance, the overall form is balanced and symmetrical about the central vertical line. The surrounding trees and landscape also appear mirrored on both sides, reinforcing the central alignment. Thus, despite the loss of architectural features, the new structure retains central symmetry.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the vertical support columns beneath the deck present and positioned at regular intervals along the front facade?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical support columns from the original cabin are no longer present. The lower level is a solid, flat marble platform with no visible columns or supports extending upward. The structure appears to float above the ground without any visible support beams. In contrast to the original image, where wooden columns were clearly spaced along the front, this edited version eliminates all such supports, replacing them with a seamless, monolithic base. Therefore, the support columns are absent.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the small rectangular window located on the lower level, to the left of the main entrance, still present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lower level has been transformed into a smooth, reflective surface with no visible windows. The small rectangular window from the original cabin is completely gone. The entire fa√ßade is now part of the crystalline structure, with no separate openings or windows. Even if one considers the internal reflections, there is no distinct rectangular window visible on the lower level. The original architectural feature has been entirely removed in favor of a unified, glassy exterior.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q7: Is the stone retaining wall made of large, irregular boulders visible on the right side of the cabin's base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right side of the structure's base is now a clean, white marble platform with no natural stone or boulders. The original retaining wall made of large, irregular rocks has been replaced by a smooth, uniform surface. The surrounding area shows no trace of the rocky terrain that was present in the original image. The transformation has eliminated all natural materials in favor of a polished, artificial foundation. Therefore, the stone retaining wall is no longer visible.",
    "answer": "No"
