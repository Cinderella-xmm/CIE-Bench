    "Question": "Q1: Is the truck still predominantly red in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is depicted in a cartoon or comic-style rendering. Despite the stylized art form, the primary color of the truck's cab and body remains red. This is consistent with common representations of semi-trucks in both real life and animation, where red is a frequently used color for visibility and branding. The red hue dominates the vehicle’s surface, including the hood, cab, and fenders, even though the shading and outlines are simplified. Therefore, based on visual cues and typical design conventions in illustrated vehicles, the truck is still predominantly red.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the large chrome exhaust pipe still present on the side of the truck?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck features a prominent vertical exhaust pipe extending upward from the driver’s side, which matches the appearance of a classic semi-truck design. Although the style is cartoonish, the exhaust pipe is clearly visible and rendered with metallic shading to suggest chrome. Its shape and position align with standard configurations seen in real trucks, such as those from brands like Kenworth or Peterbilt. Even in the stylized version, this key component has been preserved, indicating that the large chrome exhaust pipe is indeed still present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the wheels correctly positioned on the truck, including their size and visible lug nuts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck has multiple axles with wheels that are proportionally sized relative to the cab and chassis. The front wheel is larger than the rear duals, which is typical for heavy-duty trucks due to weight distribution and suspension design. Each wheel includes a detailed hubcap with lug nuts arranged in a circular pattern, consistent with real-world truck designs. While the cartoon style simplifies some details, the number of lug nuts and their placement appear accurate. The wheels are aligned properly under the frame, maintaining structural plausibility. Thus, despite stylistic exaggeration, the wheels are correctly positioned and reasonably detailed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the truck's front grille maintain its vertical slats and the emblem in the center?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front grille is clearly visible and features vertical slats, which are characteristic of many classic semi-truck models, especially those resembling Kenworth or similar makes. At the top center of the grille, there is a small red emblem, consistent with brand logos commonly found on such vehicles (e.g., the Kenworth 'K' logo). Although the illustration uses bold lines and flat colors, the essential structure of the grille—vertical bars and central emblem—is preserved. This matches real-world design elements, confirming that the grille maintains its key features.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the large windows on the truck's cab and the chrome side mirror still visible and in place?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cab of the truck includes large rectangular windows on the sides and front, allowing visibility into the interior. These windows are proportionate and positioned similarly to those on actual semi-trucks. Additionally, a chrome side mirror is attached to the cab’s door, extending outward—a standard safety feature for long-haul trucks. The mirror is depicted with reflective highlights, suggesting metallic material. Both elements are clearly present and correctly placed, even within the cartoon aesthetic. This aligns with real-world truck design, where visibility and safety components like mirrors and large windows are critical.",
    "answer": "Yes"
