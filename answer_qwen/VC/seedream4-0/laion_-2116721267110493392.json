        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the second boy is shown with a completely smooth, hairless head, which is consistent with the visual representation of a bald person. The cartoon style emphasizes this feature by rendering the head without any hair texture or strands, clearly indicating baldness. This aligns with common artistic conventions in animation where baldness is depicted through a lack of hair and a uniformly smooth scalp.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the first boy (the one with curly hair) is wearing glasses. The frames are dark in color, appearing black or very dark gray, which is typical for many types of eyewear. In cartoon illustrations, colors are often simplified, but the frame color here is consistently dark, matching the description of black-framed glasses. This conclusion is drawn from direct visual observation of the glasses' appearance in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bald boy is shown holding the tablet with both hands. His arms are raised, and the tablet is oriented vertically, meaning it is in an upright position. This posture is consistent with how one might hold a tablet to view content on screen, especially when showing it to someone else. The angle and positioning of his hands confirm that he is using both hands to support the device.",

      "question": "Is the boy with glasses leaning forward toward the tablet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy with glasses is positioned slightly forward relative to the bald boy, with his body angled toward the tablet. His facial expression and orientation suggest engagement and focus on the screen. While not dramatically leaning, his posture indicates a forward tilt, which is typical behavior when closely observing something on a screen. This is supported by the direction of his gaze and the proximity of his face to the tablet.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tablet screen in Image B shows a vivid, brightly colored interior space. It includes elements such as furniture, decorations, and possibly shelves or walls with various items, all rendered in bright hues like red, blue, and green. These features are characteristic of a colorful indoor environment, likely a classroom or playroom setting. The clarity and detail of the displayed image confirm that it is indeed a vibrant indoor scene.",

      "question": "Are both boys seated at a table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both boys are sitting on chairs that are positioned near a table. The table is visible in front of them, and their seating arrangement suggests they are at a desk or table within a classroom-like environment. Although the table is partially obscured, the context of the scene—such as the presence of desks, chairs, and educational materials—supports the conclusion that they are seated at a table. This is consistent with typical classroom layouts.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a backpack is visible on the chair next to the boy with glasses. It is located to his left side and appears to be hanging over the back of the chair. The backpack has a distinct shape and coloration (blue and green), making it identifiable as a school bag. This detail is consistent with the classroom setting and reinforces the idea that the boys are students.",
