      "question": "Is the subject’s hair styled in a tight bun at the back of her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair is gathered into a neat, compact bun positioned at the back of her head. The style appears tight and secure, with no loose strands visible, which is typical of athletic hairstyles designed to keep hair out of the face during physical activity. This aligns with common boxing or combat sports grooming standards where practicality and safety are prioritized. The visual cues—such as the shape and positioning of the bun—support this conclusion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B is clearly wearing a sleeveless crop top in a beige or light tan color. The top ends above the waistline, exposing the midriff area. This is consistent with athletic wear commonly worn in boxing or fitness contexts for mobility and ventilation. The garment's design and fit match the description provided in the question.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's shorts sit high on the waist, and the elastic waistband is clearly visible, featuring horizontal stitching and a gathered texture typical of athletic shorts. This design allows for flexibility and comfort during movement, which is standard in boxing attire. The waistband is prominent and consistent with high-waisted sportswear.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B is positioned with both hands raised close to her face, elbows bent and fists clenched, which is characteristic of a defensive boxing stance. This posture protects the head and prepares for counterattacks, a standard technique in boxing. The alignment of her arms and body supports this interpretation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A red rope runs horizontally across the lower portion of Image B, directly in front of the subject. This rope is part of the boxing ring's boundary, which is typically made of thick, colored ropes (often red) to define the fighting area. Its placement and appearance are consistent with standard boxing ring design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B is wearing red boxing gloves on both hands. Each glove has a visible wrist strap, which is used to secure the glove tightly around the wrist for safety and performance. These straps are clearly depicted, especially on the right glove, showing a white or metallic fastening mechanism. This detail is consistent with authentic boxing gear.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject’s facial features in Image B convey a strong sense of focus and intensity. Her eyebrows are slightly furrowed, lips are set in a firm line, and her eyes are wide and directed straight ahead, suggesting concentration and readiness. This expression is typical of athletes in competitive moments, reinforcing the impression of determination.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject’s midriff is clearly exposed due to the crop top, and the abdominal area displays well-defined musculature, including visible rectus abdominis (six-pack) and oblique contours. This level of definition suggests a high degree of physical fitness, which is common among professional athletes like boxers. The rendering emphasizes muscle tone through shading and highlights.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject’s skin in Image B exhibits a realistic range of tones, with subtle highlights on areas exposed to light (such as the cheekbones, shoulders, and arms) and soft shadows in recessed areas (like under the jaw and along the neck). These lighting effects suggest directional illumination, likely from overhead stadium lights, and contribute to a three-dimensional appearance. While stylized, the skin tone remains within a natural range.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject’s head is angled slightly to her right (viewer’s left), but her eyes are fixed forward, creating a dynamic pose that combines lateral orientation with direct focus. This positioning is common in boxing stances, allowing the fighter to maintain awareness while preparing for action. The angle of the head and direction of gaze are clearly discernible in the image.",
