      "question": "Is the woman’s hair styled in a short, straight black bob that frames her face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman has shoulder-length black hair with a blunt cut and bangs that fall across her forehead. The hair is straight and neatly styled, forming a classic bob shape that frames her face symmetrically. This style is consistent with a short, straight black bob. Based on visual cues such as the length, texture, and arrangement of the hair, combined with common knowledge of hairstyles, it is clear that this matches the description of a bob cut.",

      "question": "Does the woman wear a red sleeveless dress with visible knitted texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is wearing a red dress with thin spaghetti straps, indicating it is sleeveless. The surface of the dress displays a distinct pattern resembling knit stitches, particularly visible in the way light interacts with the fabric and the raised texture along the seams and body of the dress. This suggests a knitted material. The design includes decorative golden floral embroidery, but the base texture remains consistent with knitting. Therefore, based on visual texture analysis and common knowledge about clothing materials, the dress appears to be knitted.",

      "question": "Are the butterfly wings behind her back colored with blue centers, brown borders, and orange tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly wings in Image B are large and detailed, positioned symmetrically behind the woman. They feature a vibrant color scheme: the central areas of the wings are a bright blue, transitioning into darker brown edges, with prominent orange accents near the wingtips. This coloration is consistent with real-life morpho butterflies or artistic interpretations thereof, where blue iridescence is often paired with orange and black patterns. The visual details confirm the presence of blue centers, brown borders, and orange tips, aligning with the described pattern.",

      "question": "Are the woman’s hands clasped together in front of her chest with fingers interlocked?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hands are positioned directly in front of her chest, with both palms facing each other and fingers intertwined. The positioning shows a clear interlocking of the fingers, typical of a clasped gesture. This posture is common in posed images and conveys a sense of anticipation or politeness. Visual inspection confirms that the fingers are crossed over one another, fulfilling the criteria for being 'interlocked'.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a beige or light tan strap is visible running diagonally across the woman’s torso, starting from her right shoulder and extending downward toward her left hip. This is consistent with the appearance of a crossbody bag strap. The angle and placement match the description exactly. The strap is clearly defined against the red dress, making its path unambiguous.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's fingernails are visible due to the close-up nature of the hands. They are painted with a vivid, uniform red color that stands out against her skin tone. The polish appears glossy and evenly applied, characteristic of bright red nail polish commonly used in fashion photography or animated illustrations. This matches the description of 'bright red polish'.",

      "choices": [

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman has a wide, open-mouthed smile revealing her teeth, which indicates a joyful expression. Her lips are colored with a bold red shade, consistent with red lipstick. Her eyes are large, dark, and clearly visible, with defined pupils and eyelashes, contributing to an expressive facial appearance. These features are typical of stylized cartoon or anime-inspired art, where exaggerated features enhance emotional expression. Thus, she is indeed smiling with red lipstick and dark eyes visible.",
