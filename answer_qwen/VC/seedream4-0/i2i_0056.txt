    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the horse's brown coat and dark mane?",
    "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) features a stylized, cartoon-like character of a construction worker wearing a yellow hard hat, safety vest, and work clothes. There is no horse present in this image at all. The visual content is entirely different from Image A, which contains a real horse. Therefore, based on the visual cues in Image B, there is no horse to analyze for coat color or mane. The absence of any equine figure means the horseâ€™s brown coat and dark mane cannot be retained in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the horse depicted in a grazing posture in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no horse visible. Instead, the image shows a 3D-rendered cartoon character of a construction worker standing in a construction site environment with cranes and building blocks. Since there is no horse in the scene, it cannot be in a grazing posture. The original image (Image A) does show a horse grazing by the shore, but this detail is not preserved in the edited image. Thus, the grazing posture is absent in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image retain the sea and grassy shore in the background?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a constructed, minimalist scene resembling a construction site with a crane, concrete blocks, and a plain white background. There is no body of water or grassy shoreline visible. In contrast, Image A clearly shows a natural coastal landscape with a sea and grassy shore. The background in Image B has been completely replaced with artificial elements typical of a construction zone. Therefore, the sea and grassy shore are not retained in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the white house visible in the background of the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a construction site with a crane, scattered blocks, and a neutral-colored backdrop. There is no house, let alone a white one, visible in the scene. In Image A, a white house is located in the distance across the water, which is part of the natural landscape. However, in Image B, this element has been removed and replaced with industrial objects. Hence, the white house is not present in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the sea appear calm in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not contain any sea or body of water. It is set in a fictional construction site environment with no natural elements like water. While Image A shows a calm sea with gentle waves, this feature is entirely absent in Image B. Therefore, the sea cannot appear calm in the edited image because it does not exist in the scene.",
    "answer": "No"
