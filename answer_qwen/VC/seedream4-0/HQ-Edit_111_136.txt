    "Question": "Q1: Is the dancer depicted with her left leg lifted and bent at the knee, while her right foot remains planted on the ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is shown in a dynamic pose. Observing her legs, the left leg is clearly raised and bent at the knee, with the foot pointed downward, indicating an active movement such as a leap or spin. The right foot is firmly placed on the ground, supporting her body weight. This posture aligns with typical dance movements where one leg is lifted while the other provides balance. Based on visual cues and common dance anatomy, this configuration suggests a controlled, expressive motion. Therefore, the description matches the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the dancer positioned on the right side of the image, facing toward the left side of the frame?",
    "explanation": "The dancer in Image B is located on the right side of the composition. Her body orientation shows her head and upper torso turned toward the left side of the frame, with her arms extended in that direction. Her gaze and the flow of her movement also suggest she is facing left. This positioning creates a sense of motion from right to left, which is a common compositional technique to convey action. Thus, the dancer is indeed on the right and facing left.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the skirt of the dancer appear to be flared outward and upward due to motion, suggesting a spinning or leaping movement?",
    "explanation": "The dancer's skirt in Image B is white with gold trim and appears to be flowing outward and upward, particularly on the side away from her body. This flaring effect is consistent with centrifugal force generated during a spin or leap. The fabric’s billowing shape and the way it lifts off the ground indicate dynamic movement. In classical dance representations, especially those inspired by ancient art, such skirt dynamics are used to emphasize motion. Given these visual cues, the skirt’s appearance strongly suggests spinning or leaping.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the dancer positioned in the foreground, with a group of animals in the midground and trees in the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is prominently placed in the foreground, occupying the right side of the frame and appearing larger than the surrounding elements. Behind her, a herd of antelope-like animals is visible across the middle section of the image, forming the midground. Further back, several acacia-like trees are scattered across the horizon, establishing the background. This layered depth of field—foreground (dancer), midground (animals), background (trees)—is a classic artistic technique to create spatial perspective. Therefore, the spatial arrangement matches the description.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the light source coming from the right side of the image, illuminating the dancer and casting shadows to the left?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears to originate from the right side of the frame. This is evident from the highlights on the right side of the dancer’s body, particularly on her arm, shoulder, and face, as well as the bright illumination on the right edge of her skirt. Shadows are cast toward the left, including under her raised leg and along the ground beneath her. Additionally, the sky has a brighter glow on the right, reinforcing the directional light source. This lighting setup is consistent with a strong light coming from the right, creating contrast and depth. Thus, the light source is correctly identified as being on the right.",
    "answer": "Yes"
