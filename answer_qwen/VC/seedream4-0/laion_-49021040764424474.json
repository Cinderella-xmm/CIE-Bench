      "question": "Is the \"Wildtrak\" badge visible on the lower side fender of the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vehicle is a LEGO model of a pickup truck. The side fender area is constructed from orange LEGO bricks, and while there are some black elements near the wheel well, there is no visible 'Wildtrak' badge or any text resembling it. In real-world vehicles, such badges are typically placed in a prominent location on the side fender for branding purposes. However, in this LEGO model, the design prioritizes structural representation over fine details like badges. Therefore, based on visual inspection and knowledge of LEGO model design conventions, the 'Wildtrak' badge is not present.",

      "question": "Is the tailgate fully lowered, exposing the truck bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tailgate of the LEGO truck is visibly open and flat, lying horizontally at the rear of the vehicle. This position allows full access to the truck bed, which is composed of black LEGO studs. The tailgate is not raised or partially closed; instead, it is completely down, consistent with being fully lowered. In real trucks, a fully lowered tailgate serves to provide easy loading and unloading access. The LEGO model accurately mimics this functional state, so the tailgate is indeed fully lowered.",

      "question": "Are there two rear doors visible on the passenger side of the truck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the passenger side of the truck shows a single door structure behind the front cab. The design includes a door handle and window frame, but only one door is visible between the cab and the bed. The second door would be located further back if the truck had a crew cab configuration, but here the model appears to represent a regular cab with only one rear door. Based on the visible structure and typical pickup truck configurations, this LEGO model does not include two rear doors on the passenger side.",

      "question": "Do the rear taillights have a vertical orientation with a red upper portion and clear lower section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rear taillights are constructed using LEGO pieces that simulate a vertical layout. The upper part of the taillight is red, and the lower part is transparent (clear), mimicking the appearance of a real taillight assembly. This design aligns with common automotive lighting patterns where red indicates brake/turn signals and clear sections are used for reverse lights or reflectors. The LEGO model faithfully reproduces this dual-tone, vertically oriented design, indicating that the taillights match the described configuration.",

      "question": "Is a roof rack visible on top of the cab?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the cab features a series of black LEGO pieces arranged along the roofline. These pieces are positioned symmetrically and resemble crossbars typically found on roof racks. While they are simplified compared to real roof racks, their placement and structure strongly suggest they are meant to represent a roof rack system. Real roof racks are often mounted on the roof of trucks for carrying cargo, and this LEGO model includes similar components, indicating the presence of a roof rack.",

      "question": "Is there black trim running along the edge of the windows and the bed surround?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the windows and the perimeter of the truck bed are lined with black LEGO pieces. These black elements contrast with the orange body and are consistently placed along the window frames and the bed's outer edge, simulating trim. In real vehicles, such trim is often used for aesthetic appeal and protection. The LEGO model replicates this detail with black bricks, indicating the presence of black trim along both the windows and the bed surround.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rear wheels are clearly set within raised, defined structures made of LEGO bricks that form wheel arches. These arches are visible on both sides of the vehicle and extend outward from the body, creating a recessed space around each rear wheel. This design matches real-world pickup trucks, where wheel arches help accommodate tire movement and protect the body. The LEGO model accurately represents this feature, confirming that the rear wheels are indeed positioned within distinct wheel arches.",
