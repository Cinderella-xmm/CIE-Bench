      "question": "Does the atomic design retain the three intersecting elliptical orbits with a central nucleus and three electron positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the atomic imprint in the dough clearly shows three intersecting elliptical loops that represent electron orbits. These loops are symmetrically arranged around a central circular area, which represents the nucleus. The design includes three distinct points where the loops intersect or terminate, suggesting electron positions. This matches the classic Bohr model representation of an atom, commonly used in educational contexts. The visual structure is consistent with the intended atomic shape, including the central nucleus and three orbital paths. Therefore, the atomic design retains all key elements as described.",

      "question": "Is the white plastic cookie cutter retaining its original atomic-shaped outline with three elliptical loops and a central nucleus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white plastic cookie cutter in Image B maintains its original form: it has three distinct elliptical loops that intersect to form an atomic symbol, with a small central circular cutout representing the nucleus. This shape is identical to typical atomic models used in science education. There is no visible deformation or damage to the cutter, and its outline remains intact. Comparing it to the imprint in the dough confirms that the cutter's design was transferred accurately, indicating it has preserved its original atomic shape.",

      "question": "Is the cookie cutter positioned to the left of the atomic imprint, with a partial edge overlap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white cookie cutter is placed to the left of the atomic imprint on the dough. A portion of the right edge of the cutter overlaps with the left edge of the dough piece, particularly near the bottom curve of the atomic design. This slight overlap suggests the cutter was pressed into the dough from the left side, leaving the imprint. The positioning is consistent with typical cookie-cutting techniques where the tool is aligned adjacent to the dough and slightly overlaps to ensure full contact. Thus, the description of 'partial edge overlap' is accurate.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the atomic imprint in the dough have clean, continuous edges without breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The atomic imprint in the dough appears well-defined with smooth, continuous lines forming the elliptical orbits and central nucleus. There are no visible breaks, jagged edges, or distortions in the outline. The uniformity of the impression suggests that the cookie cutter was pressed firmly and evenly into the dough, resulting in a clear transfer of the design. Even minor imperfections such as slight indentations at the corners are minimal and do not disrupt the overall continuity. Therefore, the edges are considered clean and intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small central hole in the nucleus area of the atomic imprint?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, in the center of the atomic imprint, there is a small circular hole corresponding to the central nucleus. This hole matches the central cutout in the cookie cutter, which is designed to create a hollow center in the final cookie shape. This feature is consistent across both the cutter and the imprint, confirming that the central nucleus area includes a small hole. This detail aligns with the typical design of atomic-shaped cookie cutters, where the nucleus is represented by a void rather than solid material.",
