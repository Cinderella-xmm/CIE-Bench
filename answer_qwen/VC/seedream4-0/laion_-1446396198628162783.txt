    "Question": "Q1: Is the NASA logo clearly visible on the left shoulder of the space suit?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is wearing a white space suit with a prominent patch on the left shoulder. The patch features the iconic NASA 'meatball' logo, which includes a blue sphere with stars, a red vector, and the word 'NASA' in white. This logo is clearly visible and well-defined, consistent with standard NASA space suit design. The clarity of the logo is maintained despite the image being part of a composite graphic with added text and icons. Based on visual inspection and world knowledge of NASA's branding, this logo is unmistakable and properly positioned.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the red trim bands visible on the upper arm and lower leg of the space suit?",
    "explanation": "The space suit in Image B displays distinct red trim bands. One is located around the upper arm, just below the shoulder, and another is visible around the lower thigh area, near the knee. These red bands are characteristic of NASA's Advanced Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) suits and serve both functional and aesthetic purposes, such as indicating joint articulation points. In Image B, these bands are clearly visible and match known designs of real NASA suits. Their presence is confirmed by visual cues and alignment with standard space suit configurations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the white backpack unit attached to the back of the suit, with coiled white hoses extending down the sides?",
    "explanation": "The astronaut in Image B has a large white backpack unit affixed to their back, which resembles a Portable Life Support System (PLSS). This unit is connected via coiled white hoses that run down along both sides of the suit, linking to the torso area. These hoses are typical components of a space suit’s life support system, delivering oxygen and removing carbon dioxide. The configuration matches known NASA EMU suits. Although the background has been edited, the backpack and hose details remain intact and clearly visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the helmet’s visor partially raised, revealing part of the astronaut’s face?",
    "explanation": "The helmet in Image B shows a clear visor that is not fully closed. It appears to be slightly lifted or tilted upward at the front, allowing visibility of the astronaut’s face, particularly the nose and mouth. This partial opening is consistent with training or pre-mission scenarios where astronauts may need to communicate or breathe normally before full sealing. The visor’s position is supported by the visible gap between the helmet shell and the face seal, which is a common feature during suit checks or simulations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the astronaut standing upright with their body oriented to the right side of the image?",
    "explanation": "The astronaut in Image B is standing in an upright posture, with their body facing toward the right side of the frame. The orientation is evident from the alignment of the shoulders, legs, and head, all angled toward the right. The positioning of the limbs and the direction of the gaze further confirm this orientation. This stance is consistent with a person standing still in a controlled environment, such as a mission control room, which is depicted in the background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the hoses visibly connected from the backpack to the suit at the torso area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the coiled white hoses extend from the backpack unit and connect directly to the torso region of the space suit. These connections are visible at the mid-back and side areas, where the hoses attach to ports on the suit. These ports are standard in NASA space suits for life support integration. The continuity of the hoses from the backpack to the suit is clearly depicted, even though the image has been digitally enhanced. The connection points are consistent with real-life suit designs, ensuring the functionality of the life support system.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the astronaut’s boots and gloves visible and properly attached to the suit?",
    "explanation": "The astronaut’s boots are clearly visible in Image B, showing the standard white, rigid-soled design typical of NASA space suits. They are securely attached to the lower legs, with no signs of detachment or misalignment. Similarly, the gloves are visible on the hands, appearing to be integrated into the suit’s arms with proper seals. The gloves are grayish-white and appear to be fully articulated, matching known EMU glove designs. Both boots and gloves are properly fitted, indicating correct assembly of the suit.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q8: Is the astronaut standing on a blue tarp covering the floor?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is standing on a flat, blue surface that appears to be a tarp or protective covering. This blue material extends beneath the astronaut’s feet and covers a significant portion of the floor. While the original background (Image A) shows a blue tarp in a workshop setting, the edited version (Image B) maintains this element, albeit within a different context—a simulated mission control room. Despite the change in background, the blue tarp remains visually consistent and identifiable under the astronaut’s feet. Therefore, based on visual evidence and continuity of elements, the astronaut is indeed standing on a blue tarp.",
    "answer": "Yes"
