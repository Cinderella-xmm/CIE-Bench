      "question": "Is the curved carriage of the typewriter present and accurately shaped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter is depicted as an illustration on the cover of a book titled 'Tales Untold'. The image shows a stylized representation of a vintage typewriter. Observing the region above the keyboard, there is a curved structure that represents the carriage, which is consistent with the design of classic manual typewriters. The curvature appears to follow the typical arc shape seen in such machines, allowing for paper movement across the platen. Although this is a 2D rendering, the shape aligns with known typewriter designs where the carriage is curved to accommodate the paper and typebars. Based on visual cues and common knowledge of typewriter anatomy, the curved carriage is present and accurately shaped.",

      "question": "Are the round silver key caps arranged in a QWERTY layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typewriter illustration on the book cover in Image B shows a series of round keys arranged in rows. While the image is stylized, the arrangement of the keys follows the standard QWERTY layout commonly found on English-language typewriters. This can be inferred from the relative positions of the first row of keys (Q, W, E, R, T, Y), which are clearly visible and match the expected pattern. Additionally, the presence of a space bar at the bottom and the overall keyboard configuration supports this conclusion. Even though it's a simplified depiction, the layout is consistent with historical typewriter designs using the QWERTY arrangement.",

      "question": "Is the brand name \"Underwood\" visible on the front panel of the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the front panel of the typewriter illustrated in Image B, there is text embossed or printed below the carriage. However, upon close inspection, the text is not clearly legible due to the stylization and resolution of the image. The letters appear somewhat blurred and do not distinctly spell out 'Underwood'. In contrast, real Underwood typewriters typically have the brand name prominently displayed in a specific font. Given that the text here is indistinct and does not match the known typography of Underwood branding, it cannot be confirmed as 'Underwood'. Therefore, based on visual evidence alone, the brand name is not visibly identifiable.",

      "question": "Is the radial fan-like pattern beneath the carriage present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Below the carriage of the typewriter in Image B, there is a decorative element resembling a fan or radiating lines. This feature is characteristic of many vintage typewriters, particularly those from the early to mid-20th century, where a ribbed or fan-shaped design was used both functionally (for structural support) and aesthetically. The illustration includes this pattern, which emanates from the center beneath the carriage, mimicking the actual mechanical components like the typebars or frame. This design choice reflects accurate representation based on historical typewriter models.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter illustration includes two knobs on the right side of the carriage, which correspond to the ribbon spools or tension controls commonly found on manual typewriters. Additionally, there is a lever extending from the left side of the machine, which matches the appearance of the carriage return lever. These elements are consistent with the physical features of traditional typewriters. Although rendered in a simplified style, their placement and form align with real-world counterparts, indicating that both the side knobs and left lever are present.",

      "question": "Is the typewriter body predominantly glossy black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typewriter illustrated on the book cover in Image B is shown in dark tones, primarily black. The surface has a reflective quality that suggests a glossy finish, especially noticeable around the edges and curved surfaces. This glossiness is typical of vintage typewriters made from painted metal or enamel-coated materials. While the image is stylized, the shading and highlights imply a shiny, polished surface. Therefore, based on visual cues and common knowledge about typewriter manufacturing, the body is depicted as predominantly glossy black.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The platen roller is the cylindrical component that holds the paper in place during typing. In Image B, a horizontal cylinder is clearly visible just above the keyboard, positioned centrally beneath the paper. This matches the location and form of the platen roller in traditional typewriters. Although it is part of a stylized illustration, its placement and shape are consistent with real typewriter mechanics. Thus, the platen roller is indeed visible and correctly represented in the image.",
