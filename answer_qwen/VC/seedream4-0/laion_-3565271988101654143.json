      "question": "Is the smartphone still a silver-colored device with a visible circular home button below the screen and rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone appears to be silver in color, consistent with the design of older iPhone models. The circular home button is clearly visible beneath the screen, which aligns with the physical characteristics of such devices. The edges of the phone are rounded, matching the typical design language of smartphones from that era. These visual cues—color, home button presence, and shape—are all consistent with a silver-colored iPhone with rounded corners. There is no indication of any change in these physical attributes despite the digital enhancements on the screen.",

      "question": "Does the laptop retain its silver chassis, black keyboard, and visible trackpad below the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The laptop in Image B shows a silver-colored body, which matches the appearance of modern laptops like MacBook models. The keyboard is black with white lettering, consistent with standard designs. Below the keyboard, a touch-sensitive trackpad is visible, positioned centrally. Despite the futuristic graphics displayed on the screen, the physical components of the laptop—including chassis color, keyboard, and trackpad—remain unchanged and are clearly identifiable. Therefore, the laptop retains its original physical features.",

      "question": "Is the hand anatomically correct with five fingers, visible fingernails, and a natural grip around the phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand in Image B displays five distinct fingers, each with visible fingernails. The positioning of the fingers suggests a natural grip around the smartphone, with the thumb and other fingers wrapping around the device in a realistic manner. While there are holographic overlays (such as a fingerprint scan), they do not obscure or distort the anatomical structure of the hand. The hand remains biologically accurate and proportionate, indicating an anatomically correct representation.",

      "question": "Is the smartphone held directly above the laptop keyboard, with the hand positioned over the trackpad area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone is being held by a hand that is positioned directly above the laptop's keyboard. The placement of the hand indicates that it is hovering over the trackpad region, which is located just below the keyboard. This positioning is consistent with how one might naturally hold a phone while working on a laptop. The spatial relationship between the phone, hand, and laptop components supports this conclusion. The angle and alignment confirm that the hand is indeed over the trackpad area.",

      "question": "Are horizontal window blinds visible in the background behind the laptop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the laptop shows horizontal lines that resemble window blinds. These lines are evenly spaced and extend across the upper portion of the image, consistent with the appearance of closed or partially open horizontal blinds. Although the lighting and digital effects may slightly blur the details, the pattern and orientation of these lines strongly suggest the presence of window blinds. This detail is preserved from the original scene, even though the overall aesthetic has been enhanced.",

      "question": "Is blue present as a dominant color on both the smartphone and laptop screens?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the smartphone screen in Image B, the interface is predominantly blue, featuring charts, graphs, and data points rendered in various shades of blue. Similarly, the laptop screen displays a cityscape with a blue-toned overlay and digital elements such as glowing lines and data panels, all dominated by blue hues. The use of blue is consistent across both screens, suggesting a thematic or stylistic choice to emphasize technology and data visualization. Thus, blue is indeed the dominant color on both devices' displays.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smartphone screen in Image B is clearly rectangular in shape, with smoothly curved corners that match the design of modern smartphones. Despite the addition of holographic elements and digital effects around the screen, the actual display area retains its original geometric form. The screen’s boundaries remain intact, confirming that it maintains a rectangular shape with rounded corners. This structural consistency is preserved even with the augmented visual effects.",
