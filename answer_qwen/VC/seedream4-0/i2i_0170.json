      "question": "Are there two women standing with their backs visible toward the shop window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two female figures are clearly depicted from behind, facing a shop window. Their postures and positioning indicate that they are standing with their backs to the viewer, looking at the display inside the window. The visual cues such as the orientation of their heads, shoulders, and body alignment confirm that their backs are turned toward the camera and directed toward the shop window. This is consistent with common human behavior when observing a store display. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and typical observational context, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Do both women stand upright with their attention directed towards the shop window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both women are shown in an upright posture, with their bodies aligned vertically and heads slightly tilted forward, suggesting focus on the shop window. Their arms are relaxed at their sides or slightly bent, and there is no indication of leaning or slouching. The direction of their gaze—implied by the angle of their heads and the positioning of their eyes—is toward the window display. This aligns with typical human behavior when viewing something of interest. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that both women are standing upright and paying attention to the window.",

      "question": "Is the shop window displaying mannequins with outfits and handbags?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shop window in Image B features two mannequins, one on the left and one on the right. Each mannequin is dressed in a distinct outfit: the left one wears a beige jacket with red pants, and the right one wears a white jacket with black pants. Additionally, there are handbags displayed in front of each mannequin—one orange and one black—positioned on stands. These elements are characteristic of retail window displays, especially for fashion brands. The presence of clothing and accessories confirms that the window is showcasing outfits and handbags.",

      "question": "Are the two women dressed distinctly—one in a navy outfit with a beige bag, and the other in a beige sweater with a brown bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman on the left is wearing a navy blue blazer over dark pants, with a beige shoulder bag. The woman on the right is wearing a light beige ribbed sweater paired with light blue jeans and carries a brown shoulder bag. These clothing choices are visually distinct in color and style, matching the description provided. The contrast between the navy and beige attire, along with the different bag colors (beige vs. brown), supports the conclusion that they are dressed differently. This aligns with common fashion diversity observed in everyday street scenes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two women are standing side by side, with minimal space between them, indicating proximity. Both are oriented in the same direction—facing the shop window—suggesting shared attention to the display. Their relative positions and alignment confirm that they are standing close together and viewing the same window. This spatial arrangement is typical for individuals engaged in joint observation or conversation while shopping. Therefore, based on their placement and orientation, the answer is affirmative.",
