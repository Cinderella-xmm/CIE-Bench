      "question": "Is the background a uniform beige color without any gradient, pattern, or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a solid, consistent beige tone across the entire frame. There are no visible gradients—meaning no gradual shifts in color intensity or hue—and no discernible patterns or textures such as fabric weave, wood grain, or digital noise. The uniformity is maintained even around the edges and behind the objects, suggesting a flat, controlled studio-like backdrop. This conclusion is supported by the lack of visual breaks or irregularities in the color field, which would otherwise indicate variation.",

      "question": "Does the background have no visible texture, grain, or surface variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the background shows no signs of texture, grain, or surface variation. It lacks microscopic imperfections such as speckles, bumps, or roughness that might suggest a physical material like paper or fabric. The smoothness is consistent with a digitally rendered or highly polished surface, commonly used in professional product photography or digital art. There are no subtle variations in reflectivity or matte finish that would imply texture. Therefore, based on visual cues and common knowledge of high-quality image backgrounds, it can be concluded that the background is texture-free.",

      "question": "Are there no shadows, reflections, or light variations on the background surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the background itself is largely uniform, there are subtle shadows cast by the mechanical beetle and the eye-like object onto the surface. These shadows are soft but clearly visible, particularly beneath the beetle’s legs and body, indicating directional lighting from above. Additionally, slight light variations can be observed near the edges of the objects, where illumination is slightly brighter due to reflection or highlight effects. Although these effects are minimal, they do constitute light variations and shadows on the background surface. Thus, the presence of these elements means the background is not entirely free of such phenomena.",

      "question": "Is the image framed with straight edges and no border or crop distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image in Image B has clean, straight edges forming a rectangular frame. There are no curved corners, uneven borders, or signs of cropping distortion such as pixelation or stretching. The composition appears well-aligned, with the objects centered within a balanced frame. The absence of any visual artifacts like vignetting, perspective skew, or warped edges suggests that the image was either shot with a stable camera setup or properly post-processed. Based on standard photographic principles and visual inspection, the framing is geometrically accurate and free from distortion.",

      "question": "Is the lighting on the background evenly distributed with no hotspots or directional shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the background appears uniformly lit overall, the presence of soft shadows under the beetle and the eye-like object indicates directional lighting. Furthermore, the beetle’s wings exhibit bright highlights, especially along their translucent veins, suggesting a light source from above or slightly to the side. This creates localized brightness (hotspots) and uneven illumination across the scene. While the background itself does not have harsh hotspots, the interplay of light and shadow implies that the lighting is not perfectly even. Directional shadows and subtle brightness variations confirm that the lighting is not uniformly distributed.",
