      "question": "Is the transparent tank section of the vape device clearly visible, allowing the internal liquid to be seen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vape device is depicted in a detailed diagrammatic form in the lower panels. The transparent tank section is clearly shown in both diagrams, with a labeled 'Liquid' component visible inside. The transparency is emphasized through shading and color differentiation, allowing the viewer to see the liquid level within the tank. This aligns with real-world vape designs where the tank is made of clear plastic or glass to allow users to monitor liquid levels. The visual clarity in the illustration supports the conclusion that the liquid is indeed visible.",

      "question": "Is the black mouthpiece and cap at the top of the vape device present and correctly positioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper panel shows the man holding a vape device with a black component at the top, which matches the typical design of a vape mouthpiece and cap. In the lower schematic diagrams, this black component is consistently placed at the top of the device, serving as the inhalation point. This positioning is standard for most vape devices, where the mouthpiece is located at the top to allow airflow from the user’s lungs into the device. The consistent placement across both the realistic and schematic views confirms correct positioning.",

      "question": "Is the coil component located at the base of the device, visible through the transparent tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the lower-left diagram of Image B, the coil is labeled and positioned near the bottom of the device, beneath the liquid reservoir. This is consistent with actual vape device design, where the coil (heating element) is typically located at the base of the tank to ensure it is submerged in e-liquid during use. The transparency of the tank allows the coil to be visible in the diagram, even though it's not always visible in real-life devices due to lighting or material opacity. The label 'Coil' directly points to this component, confirming its presence and location.",

      "question": "Is the liquid inside the transparent tank clearly visible and present at a measurable level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the lower-left diagram of Image B, the liquid is represented by a colored section within the tank, with labels indicating 'Liquid' at two points. The liquid appears to occupy a portion of the tank, suggesting a measurable level. The use of distinct color (pinkish-red) differentiates it from other components, enhancing visibility. This representation is consistent with how liquid levels are illustrated in technical diagrams to convey functionality. Although it's a stylized drawing, the intent to show a measurable liquid level is clear.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the internal components (coil, liquid, battery) arranged in a logically consistent vertical alignment within the device?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the lower-left diagram of Image B, the components are arranged vertically: the battery is shown at the bottom, followed by the liquid reservoir, and then the coil near the base of the liquid chamber. However, in standard vape design, the battery is typically located below the tank, and the coil is inside the tank, not above it. The diagram incorrectly places the battery outside the main body, connected via wires, which is not typical. Additionally, the coil should be submerged in liquid, but here it appears slightly separated. While the overall layout attempts to show vertical alignment, the functional logic is flawed. Therefore, despite the attempt at consistency, the arrangement is not fully logical.",

      "question": "Is an airflow pathway indicated or implied in the device’s structure, such as an inlet near the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the lower-right diagram of Image B, there is no explicit indication of an airflow inlet near the base of the device. While the text bubble says 'Understanding its internal magic!', the diagram focuses on the heating element and coil structure. There is no visible air intake or venting mechanism shown in either of the schematics. In real vape devices, airflow pathways are usually present—either through side vents or bottom airflow holes—to regulate vapor production. Since these are absent in the diagram, and no such feature is implied, the answer is no.",
