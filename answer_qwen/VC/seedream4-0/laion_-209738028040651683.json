      "question": "Are the almond-shaped eyes with visible dark eyeliner and defined lashes present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's eyes are clearly visible and exhibit an almond shape, which is a common facial feature often emphasized in portrait photography. The eyeliner is distinctly dark and well-defined along the upper lash line, enhancing the eye's shape. Additionally, the lashes appear long and separated, suggesting either natural fullness or the use of mascara. These features align with typical makeup application for formal or historical costume photography, where emphasis on facial features is common. Based on visual cues such as the sharp contrast of the eyeliner and the volume of the lashes, it is evident that both elements are present.",

      "question": "Is the woman smiling with visible upper teeth in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s mouth is open in a smile, and her upper teeth are clearly visible. This is consistent with a joyful or expressive pose commonly seen in formal portraits, especially when modeling elaborate costumes. The visibility of the teeth indicates a wide, genuine smile, which is often used to convey warmth and elegance in such settings. Comparing this to Image A, the same woman also smiles with visible teeth, but the context here (a more theatrical, historical setting) emphasizes the expression further. The lighting in Image B enhances facial features, making the teeth distinctly visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the facial structure in Image B, the woman’s nose has a straight bridge, which runs evenly from the brow bone to the tip. The tip appears slightly rounded, not pointed, contributing to a balanced and classical facial profile. This type of nose is common in European aesthetics and is often highlighted in period costume photography to emphasize elegance. In comparison to Image A, the nose shape remains consistent—straight bridge and rounded tip—indicating that the facial features have not been altered significantly between the two images. The lighting in Image B enhances the contours of the nose, confirming its shape.",

      "question": "Does the woman have light skin with a warm undertone in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B has light skin, which is consistent with fair complexion tones. Upon closer inspection, the skin tone exhibits a subtle golden or peachy hue under the warm indoor lighting, indicating a warm undertone rather than cool or neutral. This is further supported by the way the light reflects off her skin, giving it a soft, radiant quality typical of warm-toned complexions. In contrast, Image A shows the same woman under natural daylight, where the skin tone may appear more neutral due to cooler ambient light. However, in Image B, the controlled lighting and likely makeup application enhance the warm undertones, making them more apparent.",

      "question": "Is the woman's body silhouette consistent with the original — upright, slender build, and proportional limbs — in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman maintains an upright posture with a straight spine and balanced shoulders, indicating good posture. Her build appears slender, and her limbs are proportionate to her torso, consistent with the original image. The voluminous dress does not distort her natural proportions; instead, it accentuates her figure in a way typical of historical fashion, where silhouettes were designed to highlight elegance and symmetry. Comparing to Image A, the woman’s physique remains unchanged—slender and proportionate—despite the different attire and setting. The editing process has preserved her physical form while changing her clothing and environment, suggesting no significant alteration to her body silhouette.",

      "question": "Is a silver necklace with a small pendant visible around the woman’s neck in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is wearing a pearl necklace composed of multiple strands, which is highly visible around her neck. There is no silver necklace or small pendant present. Instead, the jewelry is entirely made of pearls, which is historically accurate for the Rococo-style attire she is wearing. This contrasts with Image A, where she wears a delicate silver necklace with a small pendant. The change in accessories reflects the shift in costume style—from modern formal wear to historical aristocratic fashion. Therefore, based on visual evidence, the silver necklace with a pendant is absent in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s hair is styled in an elaborate updo typical of 18th-century fashion, featuring powdered white curls on top. While the base color of her hair is not directly visible due to the wig or powder, the underlying dark roots at the temples and nape suggest that her natural hair is dark brown. This is consistent with Image A, where her dark brown hair is clearly visible. The use of a powdered wig in Image B does not obscure the fact that her natural hair color is dark brown, as evidenced by the visible roots and the contrast with the white powder. Thus, despite the styling, her dark brown hair is still present and identifiable.",
