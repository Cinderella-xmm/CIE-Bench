    "Question": "Q1: Is the red lantern room with glass panes and domed roof present at the top of the lighthouse?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighthouse is enclosed within a snow globe, but the structure's top is clearly visible. The lantern room at the summit is red, features glass panes that allow light to pass through, and has a domed roof with a small finial on top. This matches the typical architectural design of traditional lighthouses, where the lantern room houses the light source and is often made of glass for visibility. The red color is consistent with many real-world lighthouses used for maritime signaling. Based on visual cues and common lighthouse architecture, this feature is accurately represented.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Does the lighthouse have a cylindrical tower with a tapering shape and weathered stone surface?",
    "explanation": "The tower in Image B appears cylindrical and tapers slightly toward the top, which is a common design in lighthouses to reduce wind resistance and enhance structural stability. The surface shows discoloration and texture variations indicative of weathering, suggesting it is made of stone or masonry material exposed to coastal elements over time. These visual details align with real-world lighthouses located in harsh marine environments. The tapering shape and weathered appearance are consistent with both aesthetic and functional design principles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a metal railing encircling the lantern room near the top of the lighthouse?",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the lantern room in Image B, a thin metallic railing can be observed surrounding the upper perimeter of the red lantern room. This railing serves both safety and structural purposes in real lighthouses, allowing maintenance access while protecting personnel. Its presence is consistent with standard lighthouse construction practices. The railing is visible despite the scale and transparency of the snow globe, indicating its inclusion in the miniature representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the lighthouse have a rectangular stone base with arched windows and a central wooden door?",
    "explanation": "The base of the lighthouse in Image B is clearly rectangular and constructed from stone-like material. It features arched windows on the sides and a centrally located wooden door, which is typical of lighthouse designs that include living quarters or operational spaces below the tower. The symmetry and architectural style suggest functionality combined with durability. This configuration is consistent with historical lighthouse construction, especially those built along rugged coastlines.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the lighthouse standing on rocky terrain within the scene?",
    "explanation": "Within the snow globe, the lighthouse is situated on a cluster of rocks, surrounded by water and waves. The terrain beneath the structure is uneven and composed of large, jagged stones, characteristic of coastal outcrops. This setting is consistent with real-world lighthouses placed on rocky islands or headlands to maximize visibility and withstand oceanic forces. Even though it's scaled down in the snow globe, the rocky foundation is clearly depicted.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there waves depicted around the base of the lighthouse, indicating its seaside location?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows stylized blue waves inside the snow globe, crashing against the rocks and surrounding the base of the lighthouse. These waves are rendered in translucent blue with white foam, mimicking the dynamic motion of sea waves. Their presence reinforces the seaside context of the lighthouse, emphasizing its role as a coastal navigational aid. While artistic in nature due to the snow globe format, the depiction is faithful to the idea of a lighthouse enduring ocean conditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the windows on the tower arranged vertically with one small window above another, and an arched window on the base?",
    "explanation": "Observing the tower in Image B, three vertical windows are visible: two smaller rectangular ones stacked above each other, and a larger arched window below them on the base level. This arrangement is typical in lighthouse architecture, where upper windows provide ventilation and light to the lantern room, while the arched window at the base adds aesthetic appeal and structural balance. The alignment and shape match known lighthouse designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is there a wooden door centered on the front face of the lighthouse base?",
    "explanation": "The front face of the lighthouse base in Image B displays a dark, rectangular wooden door positioned directly in the center. This central placement is standard in lighthouse construction for accessibility and symmetry. The door appears to be framed and slightly recessed, suggesting it leads into the interior of the structure. Despite being part of a miniature scene within a snow globe, the doorâ€™s position and material are clearly defined and consistent with real-world examples.",
    "answer": "Yes"
