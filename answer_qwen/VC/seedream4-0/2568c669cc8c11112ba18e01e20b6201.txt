    "Question": "Q6: Is the mother looking directly at the viewer?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mother’s gaze is directed forward, toward the viewer. Her eyes are open and focused, with a calm and serene expression.

    "explanation": "In Image B, the child’s head is tilted slightly upward, and her eyes are directed toward the mother’s face. This upward gaze suggests dependence, affection, or admiration. The positioning of the child’s head and facial orientation supports this interpretation. In classical art, such gestures are often used to express innocence and emotional attachment. The direction of the gaze is clear and unambiguous.",

    "Question": "Q8: Do both the mother and child have curly dark hair?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the mother and the child have voluminous, dark, curly hair. The mother’s hair is styled in loose curls that frame her face, while the child’s hair is similarly curly and flows down her back. The texture and color are consistent across both figures, suggesting a shared familial trait. Dark curly hair was common in European portraiture of the period, especially in depictions of noble or idealized families. The visual evidence strongly supports that both individuals have curly dark hair.",

    "Question": "Q9: Is the lighting coming from the upper left, casting soft shadows on the right side of the figures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the light source appears to originate from the upper left, as indicated by the highlights on the left sides of the faces, shoulders, and arms of both figures. Soft shadows are cast on the right sides of their bodies, particularly noticeable on the mother’s right cheek and the child’s right shoulder. This directional lighting creates depth and volume, a hallmark of classical painting techniques. The gradual transition from light to shadow suggests a soft, diffused light source, consistent with studio lighting used in traditional portraiture.",

The white dress shows natural creases and soft cascades, suggesting fabric movement and weight. Similarly, the blue dress displays realistic folds, especially around the sleeves and skirt, indicating careful rendering of textile physics. These details are consistent with high-quality oil painting techniques used in classical art, where accurate depiction of fabric was essential for realism.
