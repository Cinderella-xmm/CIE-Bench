      "question": "Does the image retain the triangular shape and creamy texture of the cheesecake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheesecake is clearly visible as a slice with a distinct triangular shape, which is typical for a slice of cake or cheesecake. The surface appears smooth and dense, consistent with the creamy texture expected from a cheesecake. The visual cues such as the even consistency and slight sheen on the surface support the conclusion that it retains its creamy texture. This assessment aligns with common knowledge about how cheesecake is typically presented and appears when served.",

      "question": "Are both the whipped cream and banana slices present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a generous dollop of whipped cream next to the cheesecake slice, identifiable by its fluffy, swirled appearance and white color, which is characteristic of whipped cream. Additionally, several round slices of banana are arranged beside the cheesecake, matching the typical presentation of banana-based desserts. These elements are clearly visible and match the expected appearance of bananas and whipped cream used as toppings or garnishes.",

      "question": "Is the cheesecake still placed on a white oval plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plate in Image B is white and has an elongated, oval shape, which is consistent with the description of a white oval plate. The edges of the plate are smooth and curved, supporting this identification. The placement of the cheesecake and other elements fits within the confines of the plate, confirming its function as a serving dish. This matches standard tableware design and usage.",

      "question": "Is the beige table surface visible beneath the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area surrounding the plate reveals a light-colored wooden or laminate surface with a warm tone, consistent with a beige or light brown table. This surface is partially visible under the edge of the plate and around the spoon, indicating that the table is indeed visible beneath the plate. The lighting and texture suggest a typical dining table surface, reinforcing this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the silver spoon still placed near the edge of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A silver spoon is visible in Image B, positioned to the left side of the plate, close to its edge. Its reflective surface and metallic appearance confirm it is made of silver or a similar material. It is placed on the table surface, slightly angled, and remains in proximity to the plate, consistent with its placement in the original scene. This positioning suggests it is ready for use, as is typical in dessert settings.",
