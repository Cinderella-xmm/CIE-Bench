      "question": "Are the two jet engines mounted under the wings of the airplane present and correctly positioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane is partially visible, with the focus on its front section and one side. The wing on the right side of the image clearly shows a large jet engine mounted underneath it. Another engine is visible on the left side, though partially obscured by the packaging box. Both engines are cylindrical in shape and appear to be properly attached beneath their respective wings, consistent with typical commercial jet aircraft design (e.g., Airbus A320 family). The positioning matches real-world engineering standards where engines are mounted under the wings for balance and aerodynamic efficiency. Therefore, both engines are present and correctly positioned.",

      "question": "Is the continuous row of oval-shaped passenger windows visible along the side of the fuselage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side of the fuselage is visible, particularly near the front and middle sections. A series of small, oval-shaped windows can be seen running along the side of the airplane. These windows are evenly spaced and aligned in a straight line, which is characteristic of commercial passenger aircraft. The number and shape of these windows match those found on real planes like the Airbus A320. Although part of the fuselage is obscured by the toy box, the visible portion confirms the presence of the continuous row of oval passenger windows.",

      "question": "Is the rounded nose cone with the three-part cockpit window configuration present at the front of the airplane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the airplane is clearly visible. It features a rounded nose cone, typical of modern commercial jets. The cockpit window configuration includes three distinct sections: a central windshield and two side windows, forming a horizontal arrangement. This three-part configuration is standard for many commercial aircraft, including the Airbus A320 series. The visual details align with known aircraft designs, confirming that the nose cone and cockpit windows are accurately represented.",

      "question": "Is the tall vertical stabilizer (tail fin) present at the rear of the airplane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail section of the airplane is not fully visible due to the angle and obstruction by the toy box. However, based on the visible portion of the fuselage and the general shape of the aircraft, it is reasonable to infer that the vertical stabilizer is present. In Image A, the tail fin is clearly visible, and since Image B appears to be an edited version of Image A with added elements (like the toy box), it is likely that the tail structure remains intact. Real-world aircraft always have a vertical stabilizer for directional stability, so unless explicitly removed or distorted, it should be present. Given the continuity of the fuselage and the absence of any indication of removal, the tail fin is assumed to be present.",

      "question": "Are the landing gear assemblies with multiple wheels visible beneath the fuselage and wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landing gear is partially visible beneath the fuselage. On the left side, a set of main landing gear with multiple wheels (typically two wheels per strut) can be seen. Similarly, under the wing on the right side, another set of wheels is visible. These configurations are consistent with commercial aircraft landing gear systems, which include main gear under the fuselage and wing-mounted gear. While the full extent of the gear may not be visible due to the angle, the visible components confirm the presence of multiple-wheel landing gear assemblies.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wing structure is clearly visible extending from the fuselage on both sides. The wings are long and narrow, typical of commercial airliners. Each wing has a jet engine mounted underneath, as previously confirmed. The placement of the engines directly beneath the wings is standard in modern jet aircraft design for optimal weight distribution and aerodynamics. The visual evidence supports the presence of the main wing structure with engines correctly mounted underneath.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the airplane shows the cockpit area. The windows are arranged in a horizontal line: one central window flanked by two side windows. This configuration is typical of many commercial aircraft, such as the Airbus A320, and matches the design seen in Image A. The alignment is consistent with real-world aviation design, where the pilot's view is optimized through this layout. The visual cues in Image B confirm that the three cockpit windows are indeed arranged in a horizontal line.",
