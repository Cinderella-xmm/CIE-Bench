      "question": "Is the owl's face clearly depicted with two large, dark, round eyes and a distinct facial disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl’s face is prominently displayed in the center of the composition. The eyes are large, dark, and round, characteristic of nocturnal raptors like owls, which rely on excellent night vision. These eyes are positioned within a clearly defined facial disc—a circular arrangement of feathers that helps funnel sound to the ears—typical of many owl species. This facial structure enhances auditory perception and is visually distinct in the image. The combination of the eye shape, size, and surrounding feather pattern confirms the presence of a well-defined facial disc. Based on biological knowledge of owls and visual analysis, these features are accurately represented.",

      "question": "Are the horizontal bars on the owl’s chest and the white spots on its wings visibly present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The owl in Image B exhibits detailed plumage. On the chest, there are clear horizontal streaks or bars in shades of brown and cream, consistent with the natural patterning of species such as the barred owl or spotted owl. These markings serve as camouflage in woodland environments. Additionally, the wings display numerous small, irregular white spots against a darker background, which are typical of certain owl species like the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis). These patterns are visible and sharply rendered in the image, indicating high detail in the illustration. This matches known morphological traits of owls and is faithfully portrayed here.",

      "question": "Is the owl positioned facing forward with its head slightly turned toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The owl in Image B is oriented such that its body faces directly forward, but its head is rotated slightly to the left (from the viewer’s perspective), giving a three-quarter view of its face. This positioning allows for a clear view of both eyes and the facial disc while still showing depth and dimensionality. Owls have the ability to rotate their heads significantly due to their unique neck anatomy, enabling them to look in various directions without moving their bodies. The slight turn of the head is consistent with natural behavior and adds realism to the depiction. Thus, the owl is indeed facing forward with a subtle head turn.",

      "question": "Does the tree branch display a deeply ridged and layered bark texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree branch in Image B shows an extremely detailed texture. The bark is characterized by deep vertical grooves and layered ridges, resembling the rough, segmented surface of mature trees such as oak or sycamore. The lighting emphasizes these textures through shadows and highlights, enhancing the three-dimensional appearance. Such bark morphology is common in old, gnarled trees and contributes to the overall realism of the scene. The level of detail suggests artistic intent to depict a natural, aged tree structure, aligning with real-world observations of tree bark.",

      "question": "Is the moon located directly behind the owl, centered in the upper portion of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the full moon is positioned just above and slightly behind the owl, occupying the upper central area of the composition. It is not perfectly centered but is close to the vertical axis and aligned horizontally with the owl’s head. The moon is partially obscured by the owl’s silhouette, creating a dramatic backlighting effect. While it is not exactly centered in the frame, it is centrally located in the upper half and serves as a key compositional element. Given the context of a nocturnal scene, this placement is realistic and artistically intentional. Therefore, it can be considered effectively centered in the upper portion.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there leafy branches visible in the upper corners of the image, forming a partial canopy around the owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes green leafy branches extending from the top-left and top-right corners, framing the owl and moon. These branches form a natural arch or canopy over the central subject, contributing to the sense of enclosure and depth. The leaves are detailed and appear to belong to deciduous trees, possibly oak, based on their shape. This framing technique is commonly used in nature illustrations to create a sense of environment and context. The presence of these elements enhances the nocturnal forest atmosphere and supports the theme of observation in nature.",
