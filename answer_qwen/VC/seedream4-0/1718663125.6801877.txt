    "Question": "Q1: Is the crown-like forehead design with three dots and a central triangle present on the child's forehead?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the child's forehead is clean and unadorned, showing natural skin texture and hairline. There is no visible makeup or design resembling a crown, nor are there any dots or triangular shapes present on the forehead. This contrasts with typical decorative face paint seen in cultural or artistic contexts such as Day of the Dead (Día de Muertos) designs, where such patterns are common. Based on visual inspection, the forehead lacks any artificial markings. Therefore, the crown-like design described in the question is absent.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the lace-like borders encircling the eyes clearly visible and symmetrically drawn?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the child’s eyes with natural eyelashes and skin contours; there are no painted or drawn lace-like borders around the eyes. The eye area appears unaltered by makeup or artistic embellishments. In contrast to traditional skull or sugar skull makeup styles that often include intricate lace-like patterns around the eyes, this image does not feature such details. The symmetry of the facial features is preserved naturally, but no added decorative elements are present. Thus, the lace-like borders are not visible.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the mouth depicted with a stitched, jagged-tooth pattern and vertical lines extending from the nose to the chin?",
    "explanation": "The child in Image B has a natural, unpainted mouth with soft lip contours and no signs of a stitched or jagged-tooth pattern. There are no vertical lines drawn from the nose to the chin, which would be characteristic of stylized skull makeup. The lips appear intact and undistorted, consistent with a realistic human facial structure. This is in contrast to typical 'Day of the Dead' or horror-themed face painting, which often includes exaggerated teeth and linear patterns. Since no such features are present, the description does not match the image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the eyes positioned symmetrically and maintain their original almond shape and direct forward gaze?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the child's eyes are indeed positioned symmetrically within the face, aligned horizontally and vertically. The eye shape is naturally almond-shaped, typical of human anatomy, and both eyes are looking directly forward, indicating a neutral, frontal gaze. There is no distortion or asymmetry in the placement or form of the eyes. This aligns with standard human facial proportions and normal photographic representation. No artificial manipulation or makeup alters the eye structure or direction of gaze.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the makeup pattern symmetrically aligned across the left and right sides of the face?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows no makeup or painted design on the face. The facial features are natural and symmetrical in appearance—such as the eyebrows, eyes, nose, and cheeks—but this symmetry arises from biological structure, not from an applied pattern. Since there is no makeup present, there can be no discussion of its symmetry. The absence of any painted elements means the question about alignment of a makeup pattern is irrelevant. Therefore, while facial symmetry exists naturally, the specific makeup pattern described is not present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the nose bridge clearly defined and retains its original shape and position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the child’s nose bridge is clearly visible and anatomically accurate. It is straight, well-defined, and maintains the natural curvature and positioning expected in a human face. There is no distortion, elongation, or artificial modification. The lighting highlights the nasal structure without altering its perceived shape. This reflects a realistic portrayal consistent with standard human facial anatomy. The nose remains in its natural position relative to the eyes and mouth.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the natural lip contours visible beneath the painted teeth?",
    "explanation": "There are no painted teeth present on the child’s face in Image B. The lips appear natural, with soft, unaltered contours and no overlay of graphic designs or makeup. The mouth is closed, and the lip line is smooth and continuous, showing no indication of being obscured or replaced by painted elements. Since there is no tooth pattern painted over the lips, the natural lip contours are fully visible and unobscured. This contrasts with images where face paint mimics skeletal teeth, covering the natural lip shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
