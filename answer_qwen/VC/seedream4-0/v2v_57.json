      "question": "Does the image retain the warm red and gold color palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dominant colors are warm red and gold, which are clearly visible in the LEGO minifigure's red outfit, the golden accents on the dragon, and the metallic base of the display case. The dragon itself is primarily red with gold detailing, reinforcing the red and gold theme. The background also features a gradient from amber to cream, which complements these warm tones. This color scheme aligns with the aesthetic of warmth and richness often associated with red and gold palettes. Therefore, based on visual cues and common design principles, the warm red and gold color palette is retained.",

      "question": "Is the wooden surface texture and tone preserved in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a display case resting on a black base with silver feet, placed on a smooth, light-colored surface. There is no visible wooden surface in this image. In contrast, Image A features a clear wooden surface beneath the book and pitcher, showing grain patterns and a warm brown tone. Since Image B lacks any indication of wood grain or texture, and instead presents a plain, possibly synthetic or polished surface, the wooden surface texture and tone are not preserved.",

      "question": "Are the reflective qualities of metallic surfaces retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the display case has glass panels that reflect light subtly, indicating transparency and some reflective properties. The base of the case is black with metallic silver feet that show reflections, suggesting a polished metallic finish. Additionally, the plaque on the base has a shiny, metallic appearance with engraved text. These elements demonstrate reflective qualities typical of metallic surfaces. While the reflections are not as pronounced as in highly polished metals like brass or chrome, they are still present and consistent with realistic rendering of metallic materials. Thus, the reflective qualities are retained.",

      "question": "Is the textured appearance of the book cover retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a book at all. Instead, it features a LEGO minifigure and a dragon figurine inside a glass display case. Since there is no book present, the textured appearance of a book cover cannot be evaluated in this image. In contrast, Image A clearly shows a red leather-bound book with visible texture, including stitching and a slightly worn surface. Therefore, because the book is absent in Image B, the textured appearance of the book cover is not retained.",

      "question": "Does the background feature a gradient transition from deep amber to soft cream tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B transitions smoothly from a deep amber hue at the top left to a lighter, soft cream tone toward the bottom right. This gradient is visually evident and creates a warm, inviting atmosphere. The color progression is consistent with a deliberate artistic choice to enhance the presentation of the display case. Based on visual analysis, this gradient matches the description provided in the question. Hence, the background does feature the described gradient transition.",
