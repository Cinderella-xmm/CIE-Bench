    "Question": "Q1: Does the bandage retain its rounded rectangular shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bandage is clearly visible on the surface, and its shape is consistent with a standard adhesive bandage. It has smoothly curved ends and straight sides, forming a rounded rectangle. This shape is typical of common first-aid bandages, which are designed to fit comfortably over wounds without sharp edges. The visual cues such as the smooth curvature at both ends and the elongated form confirm that it retains the classic rounded rectangular shape. There is no distortion or deformation observed in the shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the central adhesive strip still present in the same relative position and size?",
    "explanation": "The central adhesive strip in Image B is visible as a lighter-colored, textured rectangle located in the middle of the bandage. Its position is centered along the length of the bandage, which is consistent with the design of standard adhesive bandages. The size appears proportionate to the overall dimensions of the bandage, matching what one would expect from a typical product. Comparing this to the original image (Image A), where the central pad is also centrally located and similarly sized, there is no noticeable change in either position or size. Therefore, based on visual consistency and standard bandage design, the central strip remains unchanged.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the bandage retain its visible fabric texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the bandage displays a clear woven or textile-like texture, especially noticeable on the outer adhesive area and the central pad. This texture is consistent with real fabric materials used in medical bandages, such as gauze or non-woven fabric. The lighting highlights the fine grain and weave pattern, reinforcing the impression of a tactile, fibrous material. This matches the expected appearance of a real-world bandage, confirming that the fabric texture is preserved and visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the bandage's overall proportions consistent with the original image?",
    "explanation": "To assess proportionality, we compare the bandage in Image B with the one in Image A. In both images, the bandage maintains an elongated oval shape with a central pad. The ratio of length to width appears consistent between the two images, suggesting that the proportions have not been altered. Additionally, the central pad occupies approximately the same fraction of the total area in both cases. Given that both images depict the same object under different contexts (one isolated, one with packaging), the proportional integrity is maintained. This consistency aligns with expectations for accurate representation across different visual setups.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a shadow cast by the bandage, contributing to its three-dimensional appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bandage casts a soft, defined shadow on the surface beneath it, particularly on the right side and slightly behind. This shadow indicates directional lighting, likely coming from the upper left, which creates depth and enhances the perception of the bandage as a three-dimensional object rather than a flat graphic. Shadows are a key visual cue for depth and volume in photography and digital rendering. The presence of this shadow confirms that the bandage is rendered with attention to realism and spatial context, contributing significantly to its 3D appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
