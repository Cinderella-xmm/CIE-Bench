      "question": "Does the elderly man retain his white hair and mustache?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man is clearly visible with a full head of white, wavy hair that appears voluminous and textured, consistent with the appearance of an older individual. His facial features include a prominent white mustache, which is well-defined and matches typical depictions of historical figures like Albert Einstein. The lighting accentuates the texture of both the hair and mustache, confirming their presence. Based on visual cues and common knowledge of such portrayals, there is no indication of any change to these features. Therefore, the man retains both his white hair and mustache.",

      "question": "Does the pineapple retain its spiky green leaves and textured golden-brown skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pineapple in Image B displays a crown of spiky green leaves at the top, which are sharply defined and appear natural in structure. The body of the pineapple exhibits a detailed, hexagonal pattern typical of its outer skin, with a golden-brown coloration that suggests ripeness. These characteristics are consistent with real-world pineapples and match the appearance seen in Image A. There is no visual evidence of alteration or distortion in the fruit's surface or foliage. Thus, the pineapple retains its original physical traits.",

      "question": "Is the elderly man still gazing contemplatively toward the pineapple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elderly man’s head is turned slightly to the right, and his eyes are directed toward the pineapple, indicating a focused and thoughtful gaze. His facial expression, including furrowed brows and a neutral mouth, conveys a sense of contemplation. This posture and expression align with the idea of deep thought or curiosity, commonly associated with intellectual figures observing something unusual. The positioning and direction of his gaze remain unchanged from Image A, reinforcing the continuity of this contemplative moment. Therefore, he continues to gaze contemplatively at the pineapple.",

      "question": "Are the warm lighting and shadows on the man and pineapple retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is characterized by a warm, golden tone that highlights the contours of the man’s face and the surface of the pineapple. Soft shadows are cast along the left side of the man’s face and beneath the pineapple, creating depth and dimensionality. This use of chiaroscuro-style lighting enhances the dramatic effect and maintains consistency with the aesthetic of Image A. The light source appears to originate from the upper right, casting subtle highlights and shadows that define form without harshness. Since these lighting qualities are preserved, the warm lighting and shadowing are indeed retained.",

      "question": "Is the pineapple still positioned to the right of the elderly man, maintaining their spatial relationship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pineapple is placed on a surface directly to the right of the elderly man from the viewer’s perspective. The man is seated or standing to the left, facing the pineapple, preserving the same relative positioning observed in Image A. The distance between them remains consistent, and there is no shift in their alignment. The background elements, such as the chalkboard, further confirm that the scene has not been reoriented. Thus, the spatial relationship between the man and the pineapple is maintained.",
