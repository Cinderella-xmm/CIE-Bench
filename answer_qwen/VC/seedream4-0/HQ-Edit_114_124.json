      "question": "Does the edited image retain the recognizable coastline shape of North and South America, including the Gulf of Mexico and the narrow isthmus of Central America?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the map depicts a stylized version of the Americas with clear visual cues indicating the general shape of North and South America. The Gulf of Mexico is identifiable as a large indentation on the eastern coast of North America, and the narrow strip connecting North and South America—representing the isthmus of Central America—is clearly visible. While the style is artistic and exaggerated, especially in the northern regions (which appear more fantastical), the core geographical features such as the Gulf and the isthmus are preserved in a recognizable form. This aligns with common cartographic conventions and historical map representations where continents are depicted with symbolic accuracy even when stylized. Therefore, despite the artistic liberties, the fundamental coastline shapes remain intact.",

      "question": "Are the latitude and longitude grid lines still visible or clearly implied in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background of the map shows a network of intersecting lines forming a grid pattern across the parchment surface. These lines are consistent with the typical representation of latitude and longitude used in historical maps. Although some areas are obscured by the ship’s wheel and the rolled edges of the scroll, the grid remains visible in the central and lower portions of the map. The spacing and alignment suggest a deliberate attempt to maintain geographic orientation, which is standard in navigational maps. Even if not perfectly precise, the presence of these lines implies a coordinate system, fulfilling the functional purpose of a map's graticule. Thus, the grid lines are clearly present and implied throughout the visible area.",

      "question": "Is the aged parchment texture, including stains and discoloration, preserved in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the map in Image B exhibits a textured appearance consistent with aged parchment. There are visible variations in tone, including darker stains, uneven browning, and subtle creases that mimic natural aging processes. These characteristics are typical of old maps and contribute to the antique aesthetic. The lighting enhances these textures, particularly along the rolled edges and near the center, reinforcing the illusion of wear and age. The overall effect suggests intentional preservation of the original parchment-like quality, even though it is now part of a larger cinematic composition. Hence, the aged texture is clearly maintained.",

      "question": "Are the original sepia, gold, and green tones preserved as the dominant color palette in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the warm, vintage color scheme seen in the original. The parchment has a sepia tone, which dominates the background and gives it an antique look. Gold is prominently featured in the ship’s wheel and the text at the top of the scroll, echoing the metallic elements from the original compass. Additionally, the compass face within the wheel incorporates green hues, particularly in the inner ring, which mirrors the green accents found in the original compass design. While the ocean backdrop introduces blue tones, the map itself remains true to the original palette. Thus, the primary colors—sepia, gold, and green—are preserved and remain dominant in the map portion of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are at least two of the original handwritten script labels or ship illustrations visibly present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, several small ship illustrations are visible along the coastlines of the Americas, particularly near the Gulf of Mexico and along the eastern seaboard. These ships resemble those commonly drawn on old nautical charts. Additionally, faint handwritten-style labels can be seen scattered across the map, such as 'Oceano' and other partially legible inscriptions, consistent with the ornate labeling style of historical maps. While not all labels are fully readable due to the artistic rendering and perspective, at least two distinct ship illustrations and one or more script labels are clearly visible. This matches the level of detail expected from the original map’s decorative elements.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the transformed compass (now a ship’s wheel) retain the golden metallic finish and intricate engraved patterns seen in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B that was originally a compass has been reimagined as a ship’s wheel, but it maintains the same golden metallic finish and detailed engraving. The spokes and rim of the wheel feature elaborate patterns, including floral motifs and geometric designs, similar to those found on the original compass. The central hub also includes a raised knob and decorative detailing, consistent with the craftsmanship seen in the original. Despite the transformation into a steering mechanism, the material appearance and ornamental style are preserved, suggesting a thematic continuity. The lighting further emphasizes the reflective gold surface, reinforcing the metallic quality. Therefore, both the finish and engravings are faithfully retained.",

      "question": "Is the map oriented such that North remains at the top of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the map is displayed with the northern part of North America pointing upward, consistent with traditional map orientation. The Gulf of Mexico is positioned below the southern United States, and the Caribbean islands lie to the southeast, which aligns with standard geographic layout. Furthermore, the compass rose embedded in the map (though smaller than the main wheel) indicates cardinal directions with North at the top. The overall composition places the Americas in a north-up orientation, even though the scroll is slightly tilted for dramatic effect. This orientation is maintained despite the artistic presentation, ensuring that the map remains functionally and visually aligned with conventional cartography.",
