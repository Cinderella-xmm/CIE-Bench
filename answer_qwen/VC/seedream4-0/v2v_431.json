      "question": "Is the pentagram symbol (five-pointed star within a circular frame) present and structurally intact in the top-left key's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-left key features a circular head with a five-pointed star inside. The star is clearly defined with five distinct points, and it is enclosed within a circular border. This matches the description of a pentagram—a five-pointed star inscribed in a circle. The design is symmetrical and complete, with no missing or distorted elements. Based on visual inspection, the pentagram is both present and structurally intact. This conclusion aligns with common symbolic representations of the pentagram, which are typically rendered as a regular star polygon within a circle.",

      "question": "Is the Eye of Horus symbol (with eye, eyebrow, teardrop, and side line) clearly depicted in the top-right key's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top-right key in Image B has a circular head with a red background and gold detailing. Within this circle, there is an eye-like figure that includes a prominent eye shape, an eyebrow above it, a teardrop-shaped element below the eye, and a vertical line extending from the outer corner of the eye—consistent with the traditional depiction of the Eye of Horus. These components are clearly visible and stylistically accurate to the ancient Egyptian symbol. Therefore, based on the visual cues and knowledge of the Eye of Horus iconography, the symbol is clearly depicted.",

      "question": "Is the Latin cross (vertical bar with a shorter horizontal bar near the top) present in the center of the bottom-center key's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom-center key in Image B has a circular head with a red background and a gold-colored cross at its center. The cross consists of a vertical bar intersected by a shorter horizontal bar positioned near the upper third of the vertical shaft. This configuration matches the definition of a Latin cross, which is characterized by a longer vertical arm and a shorter horizontal arm located closer to the top. The proportions and orientation are consistent with typical depictions of the Latin cross. Thus, the symbol is present and correctly formed.",

      "question": "Is the Celtic knot pattern (interlacing continuous lines forming a square) present in the bottom-right key's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom-right key in Image B has a square-shaped head with a red background and a gold interlacing design. The pattern consists of continuous loops that weave over and under each other in a symmetrical fashion, forming a closed, square-shaped knot. This is characteristic of traditional Celtic knotwork, which often uses endless loops to symbolize eternity. The design is intricate and maintains the continuity and symmetry typical of such patterns. Therefore, the Celtic knot pattern is indeed present and accurately rendered.",

      "question": "Is the triangular head with a symmetrical internal geometric pattern (three arches forming a trident-like shape) present in the top-center key?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top-center key in Image B has a triangular head with a red background and gold outlines. Inside the triangle, there is a symmetrical geometric design composed of three arch-like shapes arranged vertically, resembling a trident or stylized tree. These arches are evenly spaced and symmetrically aligned, creating a balanced and deliberate pattern. This matches the description of a symmetrical internal geometric pattern with a trident-like appearance. While not a standard historical symbol, the design is clearly structured and intentional, fitting the given criteria.",

      "question": "Is the floral scrollwork (symmetrical curvilinear design with looping tendrils) present in the bottom-left key's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom-left key in Image B has a head shaped like a stylized flower or ornamental flourish. It features multiple symmetrical, curved loops that resemble scrolling vines or tendrils, forming a decorative, organic pattern. This type of design is commonly referred to as floral scrollwork, especially when it incorporates flowing, symmetrical curves. The pattern is clearly visible and matches the description of curvilinear, looping designs typical of such ornamentation. Therefore, the floral scrollwork is present.",

      "question": "Does each key have a notched or toothed bit end at the bottom of its shaft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining all six keys in Image B, each one terminates at the bottom with a distinct, angular structure that resembles a traditional key bit. These bits are not smooth but feature a series of notches or teeth, designed to fit into a lock mechanism. The shapes vary slightly across the keys (e.g., some have two notches, others more), but all share the characteristic toothed or notched profile. This is consistent with functional key designs, even if stylized. Therefore, every key has a notched or toothed bit end.",

      "question": "Are there exactly six keys arranged in two rows of three on the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keys are arranged in a grid-like formation. There are three keys in the top row and three keys in the bottom row, making a total of six keys. Each key is spaced evenly and aligned horizontally within its respective row. This arrangement matches the description of two rows of three. Counting the individual keys visually confirms the total number. No additional keys are present, and none are missing. Therefore, the count and arrangement are correct.",

      "question": "Are all six keys oriented with their shafts pointing downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each of the six keys in Image B has a shaft that extends from the head toward the bottom of the image. The heads are at the top, and the bit ends are at the bottom, indicating a consistent downward orientation for all keys. This uniform alignment suggests intentional placement for visual symmetry. There are no keys rotated or flipped; all follow the same direction. Based on this consistent orientation, all six keys are indeed oriented with their shafts pointing downward.",
