      "question": "Is the woman’s face clearly visible with her dark skin tone, smiling expression, and bright eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is depicted in a side profile facing to the right. Her facial features are clearly rendered, showing a dark skin tone consistent with African descent. She has a broad smile, revealing white teeth, and her eyes are bright and expressive, with defined eyelashes and irises that reflect light, suggesting liveliness. These visual cues align with common artistic representations of joyful and warm expressions. The clarity of her face is maintained despite the stylized cartoon-like rendering, which still preserves essential facial details such as the shape of her nose, lips, and eyes. Thus, based on the visual information and typical standards for character depiction in illustrated media, her face is indeed clearly visible with the described attributes.",

      "question": "Is the orange headwrap with multicolored patterns wrapped around the woman’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B is wearing a headwrap that is predominantly orange and features intricate multicolored patterns, including red, yellow, and black geometric designs. This style is characteristic of traditional West African textiles, such as those found in Kente or Ankara fabrics. The headwrap is neatly tied around her head, covering her hair completely and draping over her forehead and back. The patterned design is clearly visible and matches the description provided. This conclusion is supported by visual analysis of the fabric's texture and color distribution, which are consistent with cultural textile patterns commonly used in African fashion.",

      "question": "Are the large beaded earrings and layered pinkish-beige necklace visible on the woman’s ears and neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the woman is wearing large, circular earrings that appear to be made of beads, consistent with traditional African jewelry styles. They are visible on her left ear (from the viewer's perspective). Additionally, she wears a layered necklace composed of multiple strands of pinkish-beige beads, which rests around her neck and extends down slightly onto her chest. These accessories are clearly depicted and match the description. The use of layered beadwork is common in African fashion, especially in ceremonial or cultural attire, further supporting the authenticity of these elements in the image.",

      "question": "Does the woman wear a long-sleeved dress with dominant orange, red, yellow, and black colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B is wearing a full-length dress with long sleeves. The dress features a vibrant pattern dominated by orange, red, yellow, and black hues, arranged in swirling and geometric designs typical of African print fabrics like Ankara or Kitenge. The colors are vivid and evenly distributed across the garment, and the sleeve length extends to her wrists. This matches the description of a long-sleeved dress with the specified color palette. The style and pattern are consistent with traditional African attire, reinforcing the accuracy of this observation.",

      "question": "Are the wooden shelves holding multiple terracotta pots of various sizes and shapes visible along the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes wooden shelves mounted on the wall, which hold several terracotta pots. These pots vary in size and shape—some are tall and narrow, others are wide and rounded, and a few have lids. The arrangement is consistent with traditional kitchen storage, often seen in African or rustic-style kitchens. The pots are clearly visible and placed in an organized manner on the shelves. This visual evidence supports the presence of multiple terracotta vessels of different forms, as described in the question.",

      "question": "Is a stainless steel pot placed on a lit burner of the stove with visible steam rising from it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stainless steel pot positioned on one of the burners of the stove. There is a subtle indication of steam rising from the pot, represented by faint wavy lines above it, which is a common artistic convention to depict heat and cooking activity. While the flame itself is not directly visible, the presence of steam suggests that the burner is lit. This interpretation is supported by general knowledge of cooking scenes in illustrations, where steam is used to imply active heating. Therefore, based on the visual cue of steam and the placement of the pot on the stove, the answer is affirmative.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the stove in Image B, there are two wooden boards. One board holds three golden-brown bread rolls stacked together, while the other board has one additional roll and a single green cucumber slice. This totals four bread rolls and one cucumber slice, matching the description. The bread rolls appear freshly baked, with a crusty surface, and the cucumber slice is clearly green with a visible seed pattern. Both items are placed on round wooden boards, which rest on the stove surface. The count and arrangement are consistent with the question's description.",

      "question": "Is the backsplash composed of beige square tiles arranged in a grid pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backsplash behind the stove in Image B consists of uniformly sized square tiles in a beige or light tan color. These tiles are arranged in a regular grid pattern, with visible grout lines forming a consistent rectangular layout. This type of tiling is common in kitchen designs for both aesthetic and practical reasons, such as ease of cleaning. The uniformity and spacing of the tiles confirm the grid arrangement, and their color matches the description of beige. Thus, the visual evidence supports the claim about the backsplash.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stove in Image B features a metallic surface, likely stainless steel, which reflects light subtly. Along the front edge of the stove, a row of control knobs is clearly visible. These knobs are aligned horizontally and appear to be made of metal or plastic, typical of gas stoves. Their positioning and design suggest they control individual burners. The visibility of both the metal surface and the knobs is consistent with standard stove construction. Therefore, based on the visual details and common knowledge of kitchen appliances, the answer is yes.",
