    "Question": "Q1: Is the woman’s face clearly visible with her dark skin tone, smiling expression, and bright eyes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is depicted in a side profile facing to the right. Her facial features are clearly rendered, showing a dark skin tone consistent with African descent.

    "Question": "Q6: Is a stainless steel pot placed on a lit burner of the stove with visible steam rising from it?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a stainless steel pot positioned on one of the burners of the stove.
