    "Question": "Q1: Are the shrimp rendered in a pink-orange color consistent with cooked shrimp?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp are depicted in a vibrant pink-orange hue, which is characteristic of cooked shrimp. This coloration results from the denaturation of proteins during cooking, particularly when exposed to heat, causing the shrimp to turn from translucent gray to a reddish-pink or orange tone. The cartoon style enhances this color but remains within realistic culinary expectations. The consistency of this color across all shrimp in the comic panels supports the idea that they are cooked. Therefore, based on visual cues and common knowledge about cooked seafood, the shrimp are correctly colored.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is there visible red spice coating on the shrimp?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp are shown with speckled red seasoning distributed across their surface, especially noticeable in the first panel where spices are being gathered and in the final panel where the shrimp are presented atop a mound of seasoning. These red flecks resemble paprika, chili flakes, or cayenne pepper—common spices used in spicy shrimp dishes. The visual representation aligns with typical spice coatings seen in real-world seasoned shrimp preparations. Thus, the presence of red spice coating is evident.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are there yellow lemon wedges with visible rind and pulp in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, specifically in the second panel, a lemon wedge is clearly depicted being squeezed over the shrimp. The lemon is bright yellow, showing a distinct outer rind and inner pulp structure, consistent with a freshly cut lemon wedge. The texture and segmentation suggest the presence of juice and pulp, reinforcing its authenticity as a citrus garnish. This matches real-world representations of lemon wedges used in seafood dishes for flavor enhancement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are there finely chopped green herbs visible on and around the shrimp?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, particularly in the third panel, green herbs are shown flying toward the shrimp with dynamic motion lines, indicating they are being sprinkled. In the final panel, small green flecks are scattered on top of the shrimp and around them, resembling chopped parsley or cilantro—common herbs used in shrimp dishes. These herbs are also present in the background of some panels, reinforcing their use as a garnish. The depiction is consistent with how herbs are typically added to enhance both flavor and presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the shrimp maintain a curled, C-shaped form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp are illustrated in a classic curled, C-shaped posture, which is typical of cooked shrimp. This shape occurs due to muscle contraction during cooking, causing the shrimp to curl inward. Across all panels, the shrimp consistently exhibit this form, even in exaggerated cartoon style. The curvature is uniform and anatomically plausible for cooked shrimp, supporting the accurate representation of their physical state post-cooking.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the stainless steel pan with rivets present in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the primary focus is on a comic-style narrative involving animated shrimp and food preparation. There is no stainless steel pan with rivets visible in any of the panels. Instead, the shrimp are shown on plates or mounds of seasoning. While Image A features such a pan, Image B does not include it. The absence of the pan in the comic format suggests a shift from a real-life cooking scene to a stylized, illustrative one. Therefore, based solely on Image B, the pan is not present.",
    "answer": "No"
