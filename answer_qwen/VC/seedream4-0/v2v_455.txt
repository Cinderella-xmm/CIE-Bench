    "Question": "Q1: Is the character wearing a rust-orange jacket?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, multiple cartoon-style characters are depicted across nine panels. In several of these panels (e.g., top-left, bottom-left, and bottom-center), the character is shown wearing a jacket that is clearly rust-orange in color. This color is consistent with typical winter sportswear and matches common visual representations of outdoor gear in animated styles. The jacket appears to be a standard snowboarding jacket, designed for warmth and mobility. Based on visual analysis and general knowledge of clothing colors used in such contexts, the jacket is indeed rust-orange.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the snowboard positioned under the character’s feet?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown in various poses across different panels. In most of the panels where the character is snowboarding (e.g., top-left, top-center, bottom-left, and bottom-right), the snowboard is clearly visible beneath their feet. The positioning of the feet on the board aligns with standard snowboarding posture. Even when the character is not actively riding, such as in the panel where they are rolling in the snow or making a snowball, the snowboard is still present underfoot in other instances. Therefore, based on the visual cues and typical snowboarding behavior, the snowboard is consistently positioned under the character’s feet in the relevant scenes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the character wear a black helmet with red-tinted goggles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown in multiple panels. In the bottom-left panel, the character is clearly wearing a black helmet and red-tinted goggles. This combination is consistent with standard safety gear used in snowboarding. The goggles have a reflective red tint, which is commonly used in snowy environments to enhance visibility. Other panels show the character without goggles, but the presence of the helmet and goggles in at least one panel confirms this attribute. Given that the same character design is reused across panels, it is reasonable to infer that this equipment is part of their outfit when engaged in snowboarding activities.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the character have long brown hair?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in various forms. In the bottom-left panel, the character has a visible braid extending from the back of their head, indicating long hair. The hair is brown in color, consistent with common depictions in anime-style illustrations. While some panels show the character with short hair or no visible hair due to the helmet, the presence of a braid in one panel suggests that the character does have long brown hair. This detail is supported by the fact that braids are typically associated with longer hair lengths. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and typical hair styling conventions, the character has long brown hair.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the character’s pants black?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown in multiple panels. Across all instances where the character's lower body is visible (e.g., top-left, top-center, bottom-left, bottom-right), the pants are consistently black. This color choice is typical for winter sports apparel, providing both durability and contrast against snow. The pants appear to be full-length and fitted, suitable for snowboarding. There is no variation in color across the different panels, confirming that the character wears black pants throughout.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the character fully visible in the image, with no body parts cut off?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in multiple panels, each showing them in different poses and actions. In all panels, the character is fully visible, with no limbs or body parts appearing to be cut off or cropped out. For example, in the top-left panel, the character is shown in full profile, with arms, legs, and head clearly visible. Similarly, in the bottom-center panel, the character is crouching, but all body parts remain within the frame. The design style ensures complete visibility of the character in each scene, maintaining clarity and completeness. Therefore, based on visual inspection, the character is fully visible in all instances.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Does the character wear black gloves?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown in various poses across the nine panels. In every instance where the hands are visible (e.g., top-left, top-center, bottom-left, bottom-right), the character is wearing black gloves. These gloves are consistent with winter sports gear, designed to provide warmth and grip. The gloves match the overall color scheme of the outfit and are typical for snowboarding activities. Since the gloves appear in all relevant panels, it can be concluded that the character wears black gloves.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q8: Are there snow-covered evergreen trees in the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background of several panels features a winter landscape. In panels such as the top-left, top-center, and bottom-center, there are clear depictions of snow-covered evergreen trees, resembling pine or fir trees. These trees are characteristic of alpine environments and are commonly found in snowy regions. The presence of snow on the branches and the conical shape of the trees confirm they are evergreens. While some panels have simplified backgrounds, the majority include detailed snowy forests. Therefore, based on visual cues and world knowledge of winter landscapes, snow-covered evergreen trees are present in the background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
