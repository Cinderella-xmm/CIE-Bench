      "question": "Is the skateboard's distinct elongated rectangular shape with rounded ends retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard maintains its elongated rectangular form with rounded ends, which is characteristic of a standard skateboard. Despite the artistic transformation into a stained-glass style, the overall silhouette and proportions remain consistent with a typical skateboard. The visual cues such as the placement of the trucks (the metal axles) and wheels confirm that the shape has not been altered in terms of fundamental geometry. The artistic rendering does not distort the length or curvature of the deck. Therefore, based on both visual analysis and world knowledge of skateboards, the shape is preserved.",

      "question": "Is the stainless steel sink's oval shape and placement on the countertop retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sink in Image B retains its oval shape and central position on the countertop, just as it appears in Image A. Although the image has been stylized with stained-glass patterns, the outline of the sink remains clearly defined and matches the original oval contour. The faucet and surrounding countertop elements also maintain their relative positions, indicating no change in placement. This consistency suggests that the artist preserved the sink’s spatial relationship to other objects despite the stylistic overhaul. Thus, both shape and placement are retained.",

      "question": "Are the wooden cabinets with silver handles and their arrangement retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabinets are still present and maintain their general structure and arrangement — including the double-door lower cabinet, side drawers, and silver handles. However, the wood texture has been replaced with a stained-glass mosaic pattern, which alters the appearance but not the underlying layout. The number, size, and positioning of the cabinets and handles remain consistent with the original configuration. The doors and drawers are still aligned symmetrically, and the handle placements correspond to those in Image A. Therefore, while the material appearance changes, the structural and spatial arrangement of the cabinets is preserved.",

      "question": "Is the skateboard still leaning against the cabinet in the same position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skateboard in Image B is still positioned vertically, leaning against the right side of the cabinet, just as in Image A. Its base rests on the floor, and its upper end touches the countertop, maintaining the same angle and contact points. The stained-glass art style does not alter the physical orientation or location of the skateboard. Visual inspection confirms that the alignment with the cabinet and the floor remains unchanged. Thus, despite the artistic transformation, the skateboard’s position relative to the cabinet is preserved.",

      "question": "Are the beige tile patterns on the floor and white tile patterns on the wall retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor tiles retain their square beige pattern and grid layout, consistent with the original image. Similarly, the wall behind the sink continues to display a white tiled pattern with visible grout lines. Although the stained-glass effect applies color overlays and geometric fragmentation, the underlying tile shapes and arrangement remain discernible. The continuity of the tile grid suggests that the original pattern has been preserved even if stylized. This indicates that the tile patterns are retained in both location and structure, albeit visually transformed.",
