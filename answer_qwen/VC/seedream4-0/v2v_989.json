        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is illustrated in a cartoon style with solid dark shading across its entire body. The color used is uniformly dark, consistent with black or very dark gray. Based on visual cues and common conventions in cartoon representation, where solid dark tones are used to depict black fur, it is reasonable to conclude that the dog is intended to have a black coat. This interpretation aligns with typical artistic rendering practices where black animals are represented using dark fills without lighter highlights unless specified otherwise.",

      "question": "Is the dog shown in a relaxed, lying-down posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog in Image B is depicted in a horizontal position with its legs tucked under its body and head resting on the ground. Its eyes are closed, which is a common visual cue for rest or sleep. In cartoon illustrations, such postures are typically used to convey relaxation or sleepiness. The lack of tension in the limbs and the peaceful facial expression further support the interpretation that the dog is in a relaxed, lying-down state. This matches common representations of dogs resting in both real-life observations and stylized art.",

      "question": "Is the bench depicted in green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bench in Image B is colored with a teal or greenish-blue hue, which falls within the broader category of green tones. While it is not a pure forest green, it is still perceptually classified as green in most contexts, especially in simplified or stylized illustrations. In graphic design, such shades are often labeled as 'green' due to their position on the color spectrum. Therefore, based on visual analysis and common color categorization, the bench can be considered green.",

      "question": "Is the dog positioned next to the bench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is located directly beneath the bench, with its body aligned parallel to the bench's base. The positioning shows the dog lying on the ground immediately adjacent to the benchâ€™s left side (from the viewer's perspective). Since 'next to' implies proximity and adjacency, and the dog is clearly beside the bench rather than underneath or behind it, this satisfies the spatial relationship described. Thus, the dog is indeed positioned next to the bench.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, three distinct objects are visible on the bench: a black boombox (radio), an orange juice carton with a cap, and a tied black trash bag. These items are placed on the seat of the bench, matching the arrangement seen in the original image. Although the illustration is stylized, the shapes and relative positions of these objects are preserved. Given that all three items are clearly depicted on the bench surface, they are present as described.",
