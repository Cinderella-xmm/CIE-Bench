      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject maintains a calm and composed facial expression. Her mouth is slightly upturned in a gentle, enigmatic smile, which is characteristic of the original Mona Lisa’s expression. The eyes are soft and directed toward the viewer, contributing to a sense of serenity. Although the artistic style has shifted from realistic oil painting to anime-style illustration, the emotional tone of the expression—subtle, peaceful, and introspective—is preserved. This retention of mood aligns with the iconic quality of the original painting, where the smile is central to its mystique. Based on visual cues such as the curvature of the lips and the relaxed facial muscles, combined with knowledge of the original artwork’s intent, the subtle smile is indeed retained.",

      "question": "Is the subject wearing a dark garment with a gold-trimmed neckline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted wearing a dark-colored dress, consistent with the original’s somber attire. The neckline is visible and features a distinct golden or light brown trim that outlines the edge of the garment. This detail closely matches the original painting’s design, where the gold trim accentuates the square neckline. While the color palette and texture are simplified due to the anime art style, the presence and placement of the trim are clearly maintained. Therefore, based on visual analysis and comparison with known details of the original, the garment retains the key feature of a gold-trimmed neckline.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s arms are positioned in front of her body, with one hand resting over the other near the lower abdomen area. This posture mirrors the iconic pose of the original Mona Lisa, where the hands are folded across the lap or waist region. Despite the stylized rendering typical of anime art, the positioning of the arms and hands remains consistent with the original composition. The overlap of fingers and the relaxed yet deliberate arrangement confirm that the arms are crossed in front of her at the waist. This gesture is a defining element of the portrait and is accurately preserved here.",

      "question": "Does the background retain the winding river and distant mountain elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a landscape with rolling green hills, a meandering blue river, and distant mountains under a warm-toned sky. These elements correspond directly to the natural scenery seen in the original Mona Lisa, particularly the winding waterway and hilly terrain. While the artistic style is more cartoonish and vibrant compared to the original’s atmospheric perspective, the core components—the river, mountains, and general topography—are clearly present and recognizable. The transformation into an anime aesthetic does not remove these key geographical features; instead, it reinterprets them in a more stylized manner. Thus, the essential background elements are retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is placed directly in the center of the composition, facing forward with symmetrical framing around her head and shoulders. This central alignment is consistent with the original painting’s balanced and focused composition, where the figure occupies the middle ground and draws immediate attention. Even though the background is more colorful and detailed in this version, the subject remains the focal point and is proportionally centered within the canvas. The symmetry and visual weight distribution confirm her central positioning, adhering to classical portraiture principles. Therefore, the subject is indeed centrally positioned.",
