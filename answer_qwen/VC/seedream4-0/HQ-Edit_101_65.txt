    "Question": "Q1: Is the subject's facial expression, including a wide smile showing teeth and eyes looking upward to the left, preserved?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject displays a broad smile with visible teeth, which is consistent with a joyful or celebratory expression. The eyes are directed upward and slightly to the left, suggesting a gaze toward something off-frame in that direction. This aligns with the description of the facial expression in the query. Based on visual cues, the smile is pronounced and natural-looking, and the eye direction is clearly angled upward-left. There is no indication of distortion or alteration in the facial features that would suggest a change from the original expression. Therefore, the facial expression as described is preserved.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the subject's head turned slightly to the left, maintaining the original angle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s head is positioned such that her face is angled slightly toward the left side of the frame, indicating a gentle turn of the head. The orientation of the jawline and the placement of the ear relative to the face confirm this subtle leftward tilt. The neck posture supports this slight rotation, and there is no evidence of a frontal or right-facing alignment. Comparing this to typical portrait conventions, a slight head turn to the left is common for dynamic composition. Thus, the head's orientation matches the description of being turned slightly to the left, preserving the original angle.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the subject's hands clasped gently in front of the torso, with fingers interlaced?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s hands are positioned in front of her torso, with both hands overlapping and fingers interlaced. The positioning appears delicate and composed, consistent with a gentle clasp. The hands are not held apart or resting separately; instead, they form a unified gesture centered near the lower chest area. The fingers are visibly intertwined, and the overall posture suggests elegance and poise. This matches the description of hands being clasped gently with interlaced fingers. There is no sign of separation or unnatural positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the henna designs visible on the subject's palms and fingers preserved?",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the subject's hands show intricate patterns consistent with henna art, particularly on the back of the hands and along the fingers. However, the palms themselves are not fully visible due to the way the hands are clasped — the palms are facing inward and partially obscured by the overlapping fingers. While some henna details are visible on the outer surfaces of the hands, the specific design on the palms cannot be confirmed. Given that the palms are not exposed, it is not possible to definitively say whether the henna designs on the palms are preserved. Therefore, based on the visibility in the image, the henna on the palms is not clearly preserved in view.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the subject's natural skin tone and lighting on the face and arms preserved?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s skin tone appears warm and consistent with a natural complexion, enhanced by soft, ambient lighting that highlights facial contours and arm tones without harsh shadows or over-saturation. The lighting seems to originate from multiple sources, including lanterns and ambient glow from the background, creating a balanced illumination. The skin texture looks smooth and realistic, with subtle shading that reflects natural light behavior. There is no apparent digital enhancement or color distortion that would alter the natural appearance. Therefore, the natural skin tone and lighting are preserved, contributing to a lifelike representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the subject's long, wavy brown hair flowing over the shoulders preserved?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject has long, dark hair that cascades down past the shoulders in soft waves. The hair is styled naturally, with volume and movement, giving it a flowing appearance. It drapes over the shoulders and back, consistent with the description of 'long, wavy brown hair.' The color is deep brown, and the texture shows fine detail and shine, indicating healthy, well-rendered hair. Although the style differs slightly from typical Indian bridal hairstyles (e.g., more loose and less adorned), the core characteristics — length, wave pattern, and flow — are preserved. Therefore, the hair description is accurately represented.",
    "answer": "Yes"
