      "question": "Does the image retain the cylindrical, elongated shape of the baseball bats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two objects depicted resemble baseball bats in terms of their overall form. They are clearly elongated and have a cylindrical profile, tapering from the handle to the barrel. The wooden texture is rendered with brushstrokes that suggest grain and curvature consistent with real baseball bats. Despite being stylized in an artistic, possibly East Asian ink painting style, the fundamental cylindrical and elongated shape remains intact. This conclusion is supported by world knowledge of baseball bats—standard design features include a long, tapered cylinder with a thicker hitting end and thinner grip end, all of which are preserved here.",

      "question": "Are the black taped handles of the bats still distinctly visible against the wooden shafts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handles of both bats are shown as dark, segmented bands near the top, consistent with wrapped tape typically found on baseball bats. These black areas contrast clearly with the lighter wood color of the shafts, even though the rendering is painterly rather than photorealistic. The use of darker tones and layered brushwork effectively distinguishes the taped sections from the rest of the bat. Based on common knowledge, baseball bat handles are often wrapped in tape for grip, and this feature is faithfully represented in the artwork despite stylistic abstraction.",

      "question": "Do the two baseball bats remain parallel to each other in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two bats are positioned side by side and aligned such that their long axes run nearly parallel to one another. While there may be slight variations due to the artistic interpretation (e.g., subtle differences in angle or perspective), they maintain a consistent orientation relative to each other. From a visual standpoint, both bats point in the same direction and do not converge or diverge significantly. This alignment mirrors typical photographic compositions where objects are placed symmetrically. The parallelism supports a balanced composition and is consistent with how such items might be arranged in reality.",

      "question": "Are the bats still placed on a grassy surface, indicating an outdoor setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the bats resting on a textured ground composed of green and gray strokes resembling blades of grass. Although the background is rendered in a traditional artistic style—likely inspired by Chinese or Japanese ink wash painting—the visual cues strongly suggest grass. The use of fine, upward-pointing lines and varying shades of green and black mimics natural grass growth patterns. This artistic representation still conveys an outdoor environment, even if it is not photorealistic. In context, placing bats on grass aligns with typical outdoor sports settings like baseball fields, reinforcing the intended scene.",

      "question": "Do the bats maintain their slight angle toward the viewer, preserving perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both bats are oriented so that their barrels face slightly toward the foreground, creating a sense of depth. The ends of the bats appear larger and more prominent compared to the handles, which recede into the background. This foreshortening effect suggests a three-dimensional perspective where the objects are angled toward the viewer. Though stylized, the composition uses size variation and spatial arrangement to imply depth, consistent with principles of visual perspective. This matches real-world expectations when viewing objects lying on the ground at an angle.",
