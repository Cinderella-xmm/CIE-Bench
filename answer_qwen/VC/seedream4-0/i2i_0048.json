      "question": "Does the zebra retain its black-and-white stripe pattern without significant alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes appear to be preserved in their classic black-and-white alternating pattern. However, upon closer inspection, the surface of the zebra has a reflective, metallic sheen, suggesting that it is not a real animal but rather a sculpture or artificial representation. This reflective quality distorts the natural appearance of the stripes, giving them a glossy, almost chrome-like finish. While the pattern itself (stripes) remains consistent with a real zebra, the material and texture are significantly altered, which affects the perception of the pattern. In reality, zebras have matte fur, not reflective surfaces. Therefore, although the stripe pattern is maintained in terms of design, the significant alteration in material and texture means the pattern is not preserved naturally.",

      "question": "Is the zebra still in its original standing posture facing slightly towards the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is standing upright on all four legs, with its head turned slightly toward the viewer's left (which corresponds to the zebra's right). This orientation matches the general posture seen in Image A, where the zebra also faces slightly to the right. The body alignment and stance remain consistent with a natural standing position, indicating no major changes in posture. Despite the zebra being a metallic sculpture, its pose mimics the natural stance observed in the original image. Thus, based on visual cues and common knowledge about zebra anatomy and behavior, the posture is preserved.",

      "question": "Is the second zebra partially visible behind the first one, preserving its placement in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a second zebra is indeed present behind the first one, with its rear half and part of its side visible. This positioning mirrors the arrangement in Image A, where the second zebra is similarly obscured by the first. The relative spatial relationship between the two animals is maintained: the second zebra appears to be standing close and slightly behind the primary subject. Although both zebras appear to be sculptures in this image, their placement within the frame aligns with the original composition. Therefore, the framing and positioning of the second zebra are preserved.",

      "question": "Does the image still feature a grassy savannah background with some scattered vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wide expanse of green and yellow grass, consistent with a savannah landscape. There are scattered trees and shrubs in the midground and background, typical of such an environment. Additionally, rolling hills and distant urban structures are visible, which may suggest a modified or hybrid setting, but the dominant terrain remains grassy and open. The presence of natural vegetation and open plains aligns with the savannah biome. While the inclusion of a city skyline in the distance introduces an element not typically found in a pure savannah, the foreground and midground still reflect a grassy savannah environment. Thus, the background retains key features of a savannah.",

      "question": "Are the zebras' relative sizes, proportions, and perspectives maintained as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the zebras appear anatomically accurate when compared to real zebra morphologyâ€”head, torso, legs, and tail are in correct scale relative to each other. The perspective suggests they are at a similar distance from the viewer as in Image A, maintaining consistent depth and size relationships. The first zebra is fully visible and larger in the frame, while the second is smaller and partially hidden, reflecting the same relative sizing and depth cueing as in the original. Although the zebras are metallic sculptures, their physical dimensions and spatial relationships appear faithful to the original image. No distortion in scaling or foreshortening is evident, so the proportions and perspective are preserved.",
