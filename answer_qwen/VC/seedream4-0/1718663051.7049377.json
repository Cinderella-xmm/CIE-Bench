      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual composition centers around a single tree that is clearly placed in the middle of the frame. The stained-glass style design emphasizes symmetry, and the tree's vertical axis aligns with the central point of the image. There are no other trees or similar structures present, confirming that only one tree exists. This conclusion is supported by the balanced layout typical of stained-glass art, where focal points are often centrally located for aesthetic harmony. Based on this visual evidence and common artistic principles, it is clear that there is exactly one tree in the center.",

      "question": "Does the tree have a clearly defined layered canopy structure with multiple horizontal tiers of foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the tree using a geometric, stained-glass style, where the canopy is composed of distinct, segmented sections arranged in a tiered fashion. Each level of the canopy appears as a separate horizontal band of colored glass pieces, forming a stepped or layered effect. This design mimics natural tree canopies but stylizes them into repeating horizontal layers. The visual segmentation and consistent spacing between these bands strongly suggest a deliberate layered structure. Thus, despite the artistic abstraction, the tree clearly has a layered canopy with multiple horizontal tiers.",

      "question": "Is the tree positioned in front of the mountain range in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is depicted in the foreground, with a mountain range rendered behind it. The mountains are composed of angular, geometric shapes in shades of brown and teal, placed at the lower half of the background. The tree’s trunk and branches extend upward from the base, overlapping the horizon line where the mountains begin, indicating depth and spatial layering. In stained-glass art, such layering is used to create perspective, and here, the tree is clearly in front of the mountains. This placement is consistent with typical landscape compositions, where foreground elements are closer to the viewer than background features.",

      "question": "Is there a visible shadow extending from the base of the tree onto the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground beneath the tree is depicted with textured, horizontal bands of color representing grass or earth. However, there is no darkened area or gradient suggesting a shadow cast by the tree. The stained-glass medium typically avoids realistic shading unless explicitly included, and in this case, the base of the tree does not show any elongated or darker region extending outward. Shadows are generally absent in such stylized representations unless they serve a symbolic purpose, which is not evident here. Therefore, based on the visual content and stylistic conventions, no shadow is visible.",

      "question": "Is there a flat grassy plain beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The area beneath the tree in Image B is represented by horizontal bands of color—browns, tans, and greens—that mimic a field or plain. These bands are uniform and lack elevation changes, suggesting a flat surface. The texture within these bands resembles grass, especially in the lowermost section where fine lines indicate blades. Although the representation is abstract due to the stained-glass style, the overall impression is of a flat, open space beneath the tree. This interpretation aligns with typical landscape symbolism in art, where horizontal lines denote plains or fields. Thus, the image suggests a flat grassy plain.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a series of angular, triangular forms in varying shades of brown, teal, and blue, arranged in a way that suggests a mountain range. These shapes are positioned behind the tree and follow the typical silhouette of distant hills or mountains. The use of geometric patterns and color gradients creates a sense of depth and distance. In stained-glass art, such forms are commonly used to represent mountainous terrain. Since these elements are clearly present and positioned behind the tree, it is accurate to conclude that mountains are visible in the background.",
