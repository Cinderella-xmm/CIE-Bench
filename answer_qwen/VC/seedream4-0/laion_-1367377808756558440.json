      "question": "Is the hull number \"J244\" clearly visible and positioned on the side of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hull number 'J244' is clearly visible on the side of the ship, just below the main deck level. The text is large, white, and contrasts sharply against the dark, rust-colored hull of the vessel. This placement is consistent with standard naval identification practices where hull numbers are painted prominently on the bow or side for visibility. The font and style match typical military ship markings, even though the ship has been modified in a steampunk aesthetic. Therefore, based on visual evidence and maritime conventions, the number is both visible and correctly positioned.",

      "question": "Is the British flag flying from the secondary mast of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the secondary mast of the ship (the one behind the main superstructure) displays a flag. Upon close inspection, the flag appears to be the Union Jack, which is the national flag of the United Kingdom. This is consistent with the historical context of ships bearing such flags when affiliated with the Royal Navy or British maritime forces. While the ship's design has been altered into a steampunk style, the presence of the British flag aligns with its original identity as a British naval vessel. The flag is clearly visible and attached to the secondary mast, confirming its presence.",

      "question": "Does the ship retain its original silhouette with a tall mast, funnel, and forward gun mount?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship’s silhouette has been significantly altered to reflect a steampunk aesthetic. While it retains a tall mast structure and a forward gun mount (now stylized with gears and brass elements), the addition of a prominent central funnel emitting steam suggests a reimagining of the vessel’s propulsion system. The original silhouette—characterized by clean lines and functional naval design—has been transformed into a fantastical version with mechanical embellishments. However, the core structural elements like the mast, funnel, and gun mount are still present, albeit in a stylized form. Thus, while the overall shape is recognizable, it no longer reflects the original silhouette in a literal sense.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a bright yellow boat in the lower right foreground. The text on its roof is partially visible and reads 'WILLIAMSTOWN CHARTERS', not 'HULL HAMLET TOWN'. This can be confirmed by comparing the lettering and layout with known signage. The name 'Williamstown Charters' is consistent with real-world ferry services in Australia, particularly near Melbourne. The text 'HULL HAMLET TOWN' does not appear anywhere on the boat. Therefore, the claim about the text is incorrect based on visual evidence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several green lampposts with curved arms are clearly visible along the wooden pier. These lampposts have a classic design with dual lamps extending from curved arms, matching the style seen in many historic harbor areas. They are evenly spaced and continue along the length of the pier, providing illumination. Their presence is consistent with the setting of a public dock area. Even though the scene has been edited with steampunk elements, these lampposts remain unchanged and are clearly part of the environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a flagpole is visible on the far left side of the image, adjacent to the ship. The flag displayed is blue with a Union Jack in the upper left corner and a constellation of stars, including the Southern Cross. This matches the design of the Australian national flag. The flag is fully unfurled and clearly identifiable despite the artistic modifications to the ship. Given that the location appears to be an Australian port (as suggested by the 'Williamstown Charters' boat), the presence of the Australian flag is both plausible and visually confirmed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features several large, white gantry cranes typical of modern container ports. These cranes are positioned behind the ship and extend into the sky, forming a distinct industrial skyline. Despite the steampunk overlay applied to the ship, the cranes remain unaltered and are clearly visible. Their structure and placement are consistent with real-world port infrastructure, indicating that this element of the scene has not been modified. Therefore, the cranes are indeed visible in the background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pier near the ship shows four figures walking toward the camera. However, these figures are not human but rather robotic or mechanical beings dressed in steampunk attire, including top hats and brass suits. They resemble automatons or characters from a fantasy setting. Although they occupy the same space as the original people in Image A, their appearance is entirely fictional. Since the question asks whether 'three individuals' are visible, and 'individuals' typically refers to humans, these mechanical figures do not qualify as such. Therefore, no actual human individuals are visible walking along the pier.",
