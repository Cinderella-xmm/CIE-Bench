      "question": "Is the Great Wall depicted as a continuous, zigzagging structure following the contours of the mountain ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Great Wall is shown inside a snow globe, which contains a miniature representation of the wall. The structure within the globe follows a winding path across a small, stylized mountain ridge, mimicking the natural undulations of terrain. This zigzagging pattern is consistent with how the actual Great Wall traverses mountainous regions in reality, where it snakes along ridgelines to maximize defensive advantage and follow topography. Although the scale is reduced and stylized, the depiction maintains the characteristic meandering form. Therefore, based on visual cues and world knowledge of the Great Wall's design, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Are the walls constructed with visible gray stone bricks and topped with crenellated battlements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the snow globe in Image B, the miniature Great Wall is crafted to resemble the real structure. The wall appears to be made of light-colored, textured material that simulates stone bricks, consistent with the appearance of the actual Great Wall built from granite and other stones. Additionally, the top edge of the wall features regularly spaced notches or projections, which are characteristic of crenellations—defensive architectural elements used historically for protection. These details are accurately represented in the model, even at this small scale, suggesting an intentional effort to replicate authentic construction features. Thus, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Are there watchtowers visible at regular intervals along the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small tower-like structure is clearly visible at the highest point of the miniature Great Wall inside the snow globe. This structure resembles a traditional Chinese watchtower, complete with a flat roof and openings typical of historical fortifications. While the model is simplified, the inclusion of such a tower aligns with the historical fact that watchtowers were placed at strategic intervals along the actual Great Wall for surveillance and communication. Given the limited space in the globe, only one such tower is present, but its presence indicates that the design includes key architectural elements. Therefore, based on both visual evidence and historical context, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Do the trees surrounding the wall display bright autumn colors, including yellow, orange, and red foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature landscape inside the snow globe in Image B features small trees planted along the sides of the Great Wall. These trees have vibrant leaves in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which are typical of autumn foliage. This coloration is a deliberate artistic choice to evoke the fall season, possibly referencing the scenic beauty of the Great Wall during autumn when natural surroundings change color. Such seasonal depictions are common in souvenirs and decorative items to capture memorable experiences. Based on the vivid hues and their alignment with known autumnal tree colors, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Is there a large, rounded rock formation embedded near the right side of the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right side of the miniature Great Wall within the snow globe shows a prominent, smooth, rounded rock formation integrated into the base of the wall. This feature is clearly visible and appears to be part of the sculpted terrain. While not a natural geological feature like those seen in real landscapes, it is included in the model to add realism and texture to the scene. In contrast, in the original image (Image A), such a specific rock formation is not evident in the same location, but since this question pertains only to Image B, we assess it independently. The presence of this rock is confirmed visually, so the answer is yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the snow globe in Image B, several tiny human figures are positioned along the pathway of the Great Wall. Some are shown walking, while others appear to be standing or climbing steps. The figures are arranged in a way that suggests movement and activity, mimicking tourists exploring the wall. The inclusion of these figures enhances the narrative of travel and memory, which is reinforced by the label 'Great Wall Memories' on the base. This detail reflects common souvenir designs that depict people interacting with iconic landmarks. Therefore, based on visual observation and contextual understanding, the answer is yes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the path of the miniature Great Wall includes distinct stepped sections that rise up the slope of the hill. These steps are modeled to resemble stone staircases, consistent with the actual construction of the Great Wall, which often includes steep inclines and stairways to navigate rugged terrain. The steps are clearly visible and integral to the walkway, allowing the small figures to ascend. This detail adds authenticity to the model and reflects real-world engineering features. Hence, based on visual analysis and knowledge of the Great Wall’s architecture, the answer is yes.",
