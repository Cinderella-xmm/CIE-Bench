        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant has large, rounded ears that are prominent and extend outward from the sides of its head, consistent with the characteristic features of an elephant. The inner part of the ears is pink, which adds to their visual prominence. The trunk is clearly visible, positioned centrally below the eyes, and maintains a soft, curved shape typical of elephants. These features are anatomically accurate in form and proportion relative to the rest of the body, even though stylized. Based on common knowledge of elephant anatomy and visual cues in the image, both the large ears and trunk are preserved in a recognizable way. Comparing this to Image A (the original LEGO model), both images maintain these key features, though Image B presents them in a more realistic, plush-like texture. However, since the question only asks about Image B, the presence and shape of the ears and trunk are clearly retained.",

      "question": "Is the hat placed on top of the elephant's head and the collar around its neck in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow hat is clearly positioned on top of the elephant’s head, resembling a small top hat. Its placement is centered and aligned with the crown of the head, which is typical for such accessories. Additionally, the red and yellow ruffled collar is wrapped around the neck area, just below the head and above the torso, consistent with how collars are worn. This matches common fashion conventions for costumed characters. When comparing to Image A, the same hat and collar are present but constructed from blocky LEGO pieces. In Image B, they are rendered with soft textures and smoother contours, but their positions remain identical—on the head and around the neck respectively. Therefore, based on visual cues and world knowledge of clothing placement, the hat and collar are correctly positioned.",

      "question": "Are the eyes of the elephant black in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant’s eyes are large, round, and entirely black with a glossy finish, giving them a cartoonish yet expressive appearance. There are no visible irises or pupils other than the reflective highlights, which is typical in stylized or plush toy designs to convey cuteness and emotion. This aligns with common design choices in children’s toys and animated characters where simplified black eyes enhance charm. In contrast, Image A shows the same black eyes made from LEGO pieces, but they have a more rigid, segmented look due to the block construction. Despite the difference in material and texture, both versions use black for the eyes. Thus, based on visual inspection of Image B alone, the eyes are indeed black.",

      "question": "Is the elephant facing forward in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is positioned so that its face is directly oriented toward the viewer. The symmetry of its features—such as the placement of the eyes, ears, and trunk—indicates a frontal view. The body is also angled slightly to the side, but the head and facial orientation are clearly forward-facing. The lighting and stage setup further emphasize this front-facing pose, with the spotlight illuminating the face directly. In comparison to Image A, the original LEGO model is also shown facing forward, maintaining the same pose. Both images share this perspective, suggesting intentional presentation for visibility and appeal. Therefore, based on visual cues and spatial orientation, the elephant in Image B is facing forward.",

      "question": "Does the overall shape of the elephant in the edited image resemble the original block-style model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the elephant appears soft and furry, its overall silhouette—including the head, ears, trunk, limbs, and proportions—mirrors the blocky structure seen in Image A. The placement of the hat, collar, arms, and legs follows the same general configuration. Even though the textures are now plush rather than plastic blocks, the underlying geometry remains consistent: the head is boxy, the ears are wide and flat, and the body is compact with short legs. This suggests that the edit preserved the core design of the original LEGO model but applied a different aesthetic (plush/soft toy). World knowledge of character redesigns in media (e.g., turning LEGO figures into plush toys) supports that such transformations aim to maintain recognizable shapes while changing materials. Therefore, despite the stylistic shift, the overall shape is still reminiscent of the original block-style model.",
