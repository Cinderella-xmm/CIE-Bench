      "question": "Does the perfume bottle include a shade of pink that matches the \"Rose Pink\" eyeshadow in the original palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle contains a deep red liquid with a gradient effect transitioning from dark red at the top to a lighter pinkish-red at the bottom. While the liquid has a pinkish hue, it is significantly darker and more saturated than the 'Rose Pink' shade shown in the eyeshadow palette in Image A. The 'Rose Pink' shade is a soft, shimmering rose tone, whereas the liquid in the perfume bottle leans toward a rich burgundy or deep crimson with subtle pink undertones. Therefore, while there are pink elements, they do not match the specific 'Rose Pink' shade in terms of tone and intensity. Based on visual comparison and color theory, this does not constitute a match.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Anastasia Beverly Hills\" visible on the perfume bottle or its packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a perfume bottle with the brand name 'delya' written vertically in gold lettering on the front. There is no indication of the 'Anastasia Beverly Hills' branding anywhere on the bottle or its surrounding elements. The design is clean and minimalistic, focusing on the rose motif and the brand 'delya'. In contrast, Image A clearly displays the 'ANASTASIA BEVERLY HILLS' logo on the makeup palette. Since the perfume bottle in Image B features a different brand name entirely, the Anastasia Beverly Hills text is absent.",

      "question": "Does the perfume bottle feature an external accent in the color \"Burnt Orange\" as seen in the palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The perfume bottle in Image B is primarily composed of clear glass with a golden rose-shaped cap and engraved floral designs. The only prominent colors are the gold of the cap and the red-pink gradient of the liquid inside. There is no visible use of burnt orange on the exterior of the bottle or any part of its design. In Image A, 'Burnt Orange' is a distinct warm, reddish-orange shade used in the eyeshadow palette. Since the perfume bottle lacks any burnt orange accents—either in the cap, engraving, or labeling—it does not feature this color. This conclusion is based on direct observation of the bottle's materials and color scheme.",

      "question": "Is the dual-ended makeup brush visible in the final perfume bottle design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a standalone perfume bottle with no accessories attached or included in the frame. The bottle is presented cleanly against a pink background with no additional tools or applicators visible. In contrast, Image A includes a dual-ended makeup brush placed inside the open eyeshadow palette. Since the perfume bottle in Image B is a product shot focused solely on the bottle itself, and there is no brush present, the dual-ended makeup brush is not part of this design. This absence is consistent with typical perfume product photography, where only the bottle is showcased.",

      "question": "Is the background of the image a soft pink gradient matching the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background that is a solid, uniform soft pink color. While it is indeed a soft pink, it is not a gradient—it lacks variation in tone or shading across the surface. In Image A, the background appears to be a similar soft pink but may have subtle lighting effects that create a slight gradient impression due to the close-up nature of the shot. However, in Image B, the background is flat and evenly lit, without any visible transition from light to dark or color variation. Thus, although the color is consistent with the original, the gradient effect is absent. Therefore, the background is not a gradient.",
