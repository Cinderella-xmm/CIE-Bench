    "Question": "Q1: Is the elephant clearly visible and positioned centrally beneath the archway?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is prominently displayed in the center of the frame, directly under a scalloped archway that frames the scene. The composition places the elephant as the focal point, with its body fully visible and symmetrical within the architectural structure. The archway's design, with its ornate carvings and decorative elements, further emphasizes the central positioning of the elephant. This visual arrangement is consistent with traditional artistic compositions where the main subject is centered to convey importance and balance. Based on these visual cues and common compositional principles, the elephant is clearly visible and centrally positioned.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the rider seated on the elephant’s back, directly above its spine?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rider is seated atop the elephant, positioned along the central axis of the animal's back. The rider’s posture is upright, and his placement aligns with the natural curvature of the elephant’s spine, which is typically where riders are seated for balance and stability. This positioning is consistent with traditional depictions of elephants in ceremonial processions, where the rider sits on a howdah or saddle placed over the spine. The symmetry of the image further supports this alignment, as the rider is centered both horizontally and vertically relative to the elephant. Therefore, based on anatomical and cultural knowledge of elephant riding, the rider is indeed seated directly above the spine.",

    "Question": "Q6: Is the rider’s head turned slightly to the right side of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rider’s head is oriented such that his face is turned toward the right side of the frame. His gaze is directed off to the right, suggesting a slight turn of the head. This pose is typical in portraits where the subject is depicted in profile or three-quarter view, adding dynamism to the composition. The angle of the rider’s head, combined with the direction of his eyes, confirms that he is looking to the right. This detail contributes to the narrative quality of the image, possibly indicating awareness of something outside the frame. Therefore, based on visual analysis, the rider’s head is indeed turned slightly to the right.",

    "Question": "Q7: Are marigold petals visible on the ground around the elephant’s feet?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ground around the elephant’s feet is scattered with orange marigold petals. These petals are densely distributed, particularly near the base of the elephant’s legs and extending outward. The presence of marigold petals on the ground is a common element in Indian celebrations, symbolizing reverence and festivity. The petals appear to have fallen from the garlands adorning the elephant, which is consistent with the cultural practice of using flowers in ceremonial contexts. The visual clarity of the petals, along with their color and distribution, confirms their presence.",

These domes are part of larger buildings, likely palaces or temples, and feature intricate detailing and golden accents. The architectural style is consistent with Mughal or Rajput design, commonly found in North India. The domes are symmetrical and positioned on either side of the central pathway, contributing to the balanced composition of the scene. Their visibility is enhanced by the open space behind the archway, allowing them to be clearly seen. Therefore, based on visual cues and architectural knowledge, two dome-shaped structures are indeed visible in the background.",
