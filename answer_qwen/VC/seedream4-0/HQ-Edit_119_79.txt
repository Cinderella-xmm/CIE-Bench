    "Question": "Q1: Is the calico pattern of orange, black, and white patches preserved in the same spatial arrangement across the cat’s body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted as a mosaic sculpture composed of gem-like facets. The coloration includes clear, brown, black, and green elements that mimic the calico pattern. However, instead of fur, the colors are represented by individual crystal pieces arranged in a geometric fashion. While the overall distribution of orange (amber), black, and white (clear) areas roughly mirrors the original calico pattern seen in typical cats, the spatial arrangement is not preserved in a naturalistic way due to the stylized, angular nature of the crystals. The patches are segmented into sharp, faceted shapes rather than flowing organic patterns. Therefore, although the general color scheme is maintained, the exact spatial arrangement of the patches is altered by the artistic interpretation.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the eyes still green and positioned symmetrically in the center of the face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes are clearly visible and are made of bright green gemstones, which match the green hue seen in the original image. They are placed centrally on the face, one on each side of the vertical axis, and appear to be symmetrically aligned. This symmetry is consistent with natural feline facial anatomy and matches the positioning in the original image. Despite being crystalline in form, their placement and color remain faithful to the original depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the cat in an upright seated position with both front paws placed directly in front of the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat sculpture is shown in a seated posture, with its body upright and its front legs positioned forward. The paws are clearly defined and placed directly in front of the torso, mimicking the natural sitting pose of a cat. Although the limbs are constructed from angular crystal facets, the overall posture remains consistent with the anatomical structure of a seated cat. The alignment of the paws relative to the body suggests a balanced and symmetrical sitting position.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the pink nose present at the center of the face, surrounded by white fur on the muzzle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the nose area is formed by a small, clear or translucent crystal piece, but it lacks any pink coloring. Instead, it appears as a neutral or transparent facet. Furthermore, the surrounding area is not white fur but rather a cluster of clear and colored crystals. There is no visible pink nose or white fur on the muzzle; these features have been replaced by the geometric design of the sculpture. In contrast, the original image (Image A) clearly shows a pink nose centered on a white-furred muzzle. Thus, this feature has been significantly altered in the edited version.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the cat seated on a vertical wooden block that supports its full weight?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat sculpture is positioned atop a vertical wooden stump, similar to the one in Image A. The base appears to be solid and stable, supporting the entire lower body of the cat. The structure of the wooden block is consistent with a tree stump, and the cat’s body rests fully upon it without any indication of suspension or imbalance. The weight distribution appears realistic for a seated figure, even though the cat is made of crystals. Therefore, the wooden block serves as a full support for the cat’s weight.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the tail curled to the right side and displaying alternating orange and black bands consistent with the body pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the cat is visibly curved toward the right side of the frame, consistent with the original image. It is composed of alternating segments of amber (orange) and dark (black) crystal facets, which reflect the calico pattern seen in the body. These bands follow a similar sequence to those on the torso and hindquarters, maintaining visual continuity. Although the texture is crystalline rather than fur, the banding pattern and curl direction are preserved. Thus, the tail retains both the shape and color pattern of the original.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are both ears upright and pointed forward, symmetrically placed on the top of the head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ears are clearly defined as upward-pointing triangular structures made of clear and amber-colored crystals. They are positioned symmetrically on either side of the head and are oriented forward, matching the alert posture seen in the original image. The symmetry and orientation are consistent with natural feline ear placement. Even though they are stylized, their shape and positioning suggest attentiveness and balance, preserving the intended expression of the cat.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is there a large white fluffy area on the chest extending from the neck down to the front paws?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chest area of the cat is composed of clear and white-tinted crystal facets, but it does not resemble fluffy fur. Instead, it has a geometric, faceted appearance. While the region is predominantly light-colored, resembling white, it lacks the soft, textured quality of fur. Moreover, the transition from neck to paws is not smooth or fluffy but segmented into angular shapes. In contrast, Image A shows a distinct, fluffy white chest extending downward. Therefore, while the color may suggest whiteness, the texture and form do not preserve the 'fluffy' characteristic.",
    "answer": "No"
