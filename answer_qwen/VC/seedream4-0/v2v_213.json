      "question": "Does the edited image retain the specific black spots and white markings on the butterfly's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is rendered in a blocky, pixelated style reminiscent of LEGO or voxel art. Despite this stylized representation, the overall pattern of the wings—specifically the placement of black spots and white markings—is preserved. The black spots are visible as dark blocks arranged in a similar configuration to natural butterfly wing patterns, and the white markings are represented by lighter-colored blocks along the edges of the wings. While the texture is not smooth or realistic, the key visual elements such as the position and shape of the spots are maintained in a simplified form. This indicates that the essential features of the wing pattern have been retained even though they are abstracted into a geometric form.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the fuzzy texture of the butterfly's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly’s body is constructed from block-like elements, consistent with the voxel-style design. The body appears solid and composed of uniform cubes rather than soft, fuzzy material. In contrast, real butterflies (like the Painted Lady, which this resembles) have a fuzzy, hair-like texture on their thorax and abdomen due to fine scales and hairs. The edited version lacks any indication of softness or fine detail; instead, it presents a rigid, angular structure. Therefore, the fuzzy texture has not been retained in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly still positioned on the wooden surface in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background and surface in Image B remain consistent with Image A: a wooden table with horizontal grain lines and warm brown tones. The butterfly is placed in the same central position, resting on the edge of the table. Although the butterfly itself is now stylized, its spatial relationship to the surface has not changed. There is no shift in perspective, lighting, or positioning that would suggest movement or reorientation. Thus, based on visual cues and context, the butterfly remains on the same wooden surface as in the original.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the detailed texture of the butterfly's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are made up of discrete, cube-shaped blocks, creating a pixelated appearance. Real butterfly wings have a delicate, intricate texture formed by microscopic scales that create iridescent and fine patterns. These details are absent in the edited image, where the texture is replaced by sharp, geometric shapes. While the general color scheme and pattern are preserved, the fine-scale texture—such as the gradation of colors and subtle scale arrangement—is lost. Therefore, the detailed texture is not retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of spots on the butterfly's wings in Image B follows the same general layout as seen in real butterflies like the Painted Lady. The black spots are located in similar positions on both forewings and hindwings, and the white markings near the wing margins are also present. Even though the rendering is blocky, the relative spacing and grouping of these features match the biological pattern observed in nature. The transformation into a voxel model does not alter the fundamental placement of these markings. Hence, despite the artistic abstraction, the specific arrangement of spots is preserved.",
