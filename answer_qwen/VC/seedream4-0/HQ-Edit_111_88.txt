    "Question": "Q1: Is the dancer’s right leg raised high with the knee bent and foot pointed down, and is her left arm extended upward while her body leans forward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is depicted in a dynamic pose characteristic of traditional African dance. Her right leg is clearly raised high, with the knee bent and the foot pointing downward, indicating a mid-motion step typical of energetic dance movements. Her left arm is extended upward, holding a colorful cloth, which enhances the sense of motion and balance. The body leans slightly forward, contributing to the overall impression of movement and grace. This posture aligns with common representations of African dance forms that emphasize rhythm and expressive gestures. The stained-glass style does not obscure these details; instead, it emphasizes them through bold lines and segmented shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the beaded top and patterned skirt visibly present on the dancer, maintaining their distinct horizontal striped and geometric designs?",
    "explanation": "The dancer in Image B wears a beaded top and a patterned skirt that are clearly visible despite the stained-glass artistic style. The top features horizontal stripes composed of various colors, consistent with traditional African beadwork. The skirt displays geometric patterns, including diamond and checkerboard motifs, rendered in vibrant hues such as yellow, red, blue, and orange. These designs are preserved in the stained-glass medium through segmented color fields, which mimic the appearance of woven or embroidered fabric. The visual clarity of these patterns confirms their presence and adherence to cultural design elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are there multiple bracelets on both wrists, anklets on both ankles, a multi-layered necklace around the neck, and a headband on the head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is adorned with multiple accessories. Both wrists display several bracelets, each composed of different colored bands, consistent with traditional African jewelry. Anklets are visible on both ankles, featuring layered, multicolored bands that match the style of the bracelets. Around the neck, a multi-layered necklace is clearly present, made up of stacked circular or tubular beads. A headband, decorated with similar colors and patterns, wraps around the dancer's forehead. These elements are stylized but remain identifiable within the stained-glass format, where each piece is delineated by lead lines and distinct color sections.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are there at least five elephants visible in the background, positioned near the huts and scattered across the ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes several elephant figures. Upon close inspection, at least six elephants can be identified: some are lying down, others are sitting, and one appears to be standing. They are positioned near the huts and dispersed across the sandy ground, suggesting a communal or natural setting. Although the stained-glass style simplifies their forms, their trunks, tusks, and ears are recognizable enough to confirm their identity as elephants. The number exceeds five, satisfying the condition of the question.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there at least three human figures visible in the background, with some seated and some standing near the huts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background contains multiple human figures. On the left side, two individuals are seated near the hut, appearing to engage in an activity such as tool-making or conversation. On the right side, another figure stands near the second hut, possibly walking or observing. Additionally, a fourth figure is partially visible behind the right hut. These figures are rendered in simplified form due to the stained-glass style, but their postures—seated and standing—are distinguishable. Thus, there are more than three human figures, fulfilling the requirement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there two distinct thatched-roof huts visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the scene?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows two prominent structures in the background with conical thatched roofs, typical of traditional African dwellings. One hut is located on the left side of the composition, and another is on the right. Both are constructed with visible wooden supports and straw-like roofing material, consistent with vernacular architecture in savanna regions. Despite the artistic abstraction of the stained-glass medium, the structural features of the huts—such as their shape, texture, and placement—are clear enough to identify them as separate and distinct buildings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there at least two acacia trees with flat, rounded canopies visible in the background behind the huts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes several tree silhouettes. Two of these trees, located behind the huts, have flat, rounded canopies characteristic of acacia trees commonly found in African savannas. Their sparse branches and broad crowns are stylized but recognizable in the stained-glass format. These trees contribute to the environmental context, reinforcing the African setting. While other trees may be present, the two acacias are clearly distinguishable by their unique canopy shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the dancer positioned in the foreground, clearly separated from the background elements like huts and elephants?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer occupies the central foreground of the composition. She is significantly larger in scale compared to the background elements such as the huts, elephants, and other human figures, which creates a strong sense of depth and separation. The stained-glass frame further isolates her, drawing attention to her dynamic pose. Her placement in front of the landscape, combined with the use of perspective and layering in the artwork, ensures she is visually distinct from the background, making her the focal point of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
