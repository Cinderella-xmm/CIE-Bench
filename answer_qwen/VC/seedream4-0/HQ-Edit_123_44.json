      "question": "Is the U.S. national insignia (white star within a blue circle, flanked by red and white bars) present on the wings and fuselage of the aircraft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft is displayed inside a glass case, and its underside is visible. On both wings, there is a clear depiction of a white star within a blue circle, with red and white bars extending horizontally from the sides of the circle—this matches the U.S. national insignia used during World War II on military aircraft. Additionally, a similar insignia is visible on the fuselage near the tail section. This marking is consistent with historical U.S. military aircraft designations, particularly those from the 1940s. The presence of this insignia confirms the aircraft's association with the U.S. military. Based on visual inspection and world knowledge of WWII-era U.S. aircraft markings, the insignia is accurately represented.",

      "question": "Are there two radial engines mounted beneath the wings of the aircraft, one on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft is shown in a three-dimensional orientation within a display case. Each wing has a large engine nacelle attached beneath it, positioned symmetrically. These nacelles are characteristic of radial engines, which were commonly used in twin-engine aircraft of the mid-20th century. The shape and placement of these engines—beneath the wings, one per side—are typical of designs such as the Grumman TBF Avenger or similar aircraft. The engines appear to be mounted externally, consistent with radial engine configurations. Therefore, based on visual evidence and historical aircraft design knowledge, two radial engines are indeed present beneath the wings.",

      "question": "Does each engine have a three-bladed propeller attached to its front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the propellers at the front of each engine are clearly visible. Each propeller consists of three blades, which is consistent with the design of many WWII-era aircraft engines. The blades are angled appropriately for rotation and are attached to the engine’s nose. The configuration matches known models like the Pratt & Whitney R-1830 or similar radial engines that powered aircraft such as the TBF Avenger. The three-bladed design was common for balancing performance and efficiency during that period. Thus, based on visual cues and historical aviation knowledge, each engine does have a three-bladed propeller.",

      "question": "Is there a rounded, transparent cockpit canopy located at the front of the fuselage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cockpit area of the aircraft is visible from below and slightly from the rear. The canopy appears to be rounded and transparent, covering the pilot's compartment. It is located at the forward end of the fuselage, directly above the nose section. The shape and material suggest a plexiglass or acrylic construction, typical of WWII-era military aircraft. This type of canopy provided good visibility and was common on torpedo bombers and attack aircraft. Given the visual clarity and positioning, the presence of a rounded, transparent cockpit canopy is confirmed.",

      "question": "Do the wings extend straight and symmetrically from the fuselage, forming a dihedral angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the aircraft are visible from below, showing their attachment to the fuselage. The wings extend outward from the centerline and are symmetrical in shape and length. They also appear to be angled upward relative to the horizontal plane of the fuselage, which is known as a dihedral angle. This design improves lateral stability during flight and is common in many aircraft, especially those designed for carrier operations. The wings maintain a straight span with no noticeable sweepback, and their upward tilt is evident. Therefore, based on visual observation and aerodynamic principles, the wings do form a dihedral angle.",

      "question": "Is the tail section composed of a vertical stabilizer and two horizontal stabilizers with small fins at the ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail section of the aircraft is visible from below. It features a single vertical stabilizer (fin) at the rear, which is typical for most monoplane designs. Attached to the horizontal stabilizer, there are two small fins at the tips—these are called elevators or rudder control surfaces. The horizontal stabilizers extend from the fuselage and are symmetrically placed, with small vertical fins at their outer ends, which are likely part of the control surface design. This configuration is consistent with the tail design of many WWII-era aircraft, such as the TBF Avenger. Thus, the tail section includes both a vertical stabilizer and horizontal stabilizers with small fins at the ends.",
