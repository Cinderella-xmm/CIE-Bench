    "Question": "Q1: Is the white oval-shaped sink still present on the wooden vanity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central feature of the bathroom vanity is a white, oval-shaped vessel sink placed directly on top of the wooden countertop. This sink is clearly visible and matches the description in the question. The shape and placement are consistent with typical modern bathroom designs where vessel sinks are used for aesthetic appeal. Based on visual inspection, the sink remains unchanged in form and position. There is no indication of it being removed or replaced. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the golden faucet still positioned above and centered over the sink?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the faucet is visible but does not appear to be golden in color—it is dark, likely matte black or bronze, which contrasts with the description of a 'golden' faucet. Additionally, while the faucet is mounted on the wall above the sink, its position appears slightly off-center relative to the sink's width, leaning more toward the left side. This deviation from centering suggests that either the faucet was repositioned or the original design has been altered. Given that the faucet is not golden and is not perfectly centered, the answer must be 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"

Its appearance matches the description in the question—dark glass material and red floral stems. This decorative element is commonly used in interior design to add warmth and natural contrast to neutral spaces. Since this object is present and unaltered in appearance and location, the answer is 'Yes'.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the large white marble-style wall tiles with gray veining still present?",
    "explanation": "The wall behind the vanity in Image B features large rectangular tiles with a white base and gray veining, characteristic of marble-look tiles commonly used in modern bathrooms. These tiles extend across the entire visible wall surface and maintain their size, pattern, and texture as seen in typical high-end bathroom designs.

    "Question": "Q5: Are the two cylindrical pendant lights still flanking the wall art?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, two cylindrical pendant lights are visible on either side of the wall art (which is now a textile piece depicting mountains). These lights are mounted symmetrically on the wall and emit warm light, consistent with their function in bathroom lighting design. Their positioning mirrors the typical setup where sconces flank a mirror or artwork to provide balanced illumination. Since both lights are present and located on either side of the central wall decoration, they continue to flank the wall art. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"
