      "question": "Is the knight wearing a crown with multiple pointed spires on his head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight is clearly visible inside a snow globe-like structure. His head is adorned with a crown that features multiple upward-pointing spires, which are characteristic of regal or royal crowns in medieval or fantasy depictions. These spires are evenly spaced and rise vertically from the base of the crown, resembling traditional representations of kingship. This design is consistent with historical and fictional depictions of royal crowns, such as those seen in European heraldry or fantasy art. The visual clarity of the crown's structure allows for confident identification of its spiked form.",

      "question": "Is there a long red cloak with gold trim draped over the knight’s left shoulder and trailing behind him?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the knight is wearing a flowing red cloak that begins at his left shoulder and extends backward, forming a dramatic trail on the ground. The edges of the cloak appear to have a decorative border, consistent with gold trim, which is common in royal or noble attire to signify status. The fabric drapes naturally, suggesting weight and texture, and the color contrast between the red and the metallic armor enhances visibility. The placement over the left shoulder and the way it trails behind aligns with typical ceremonial garb in historical or fantasy settings.",

      "question": "Is the knight holding a longsword in his right hand, resting it on the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight is depicted standing in profile, facing right. His right hand is gripping the hilt of a longsword, which extends downward and rests on the ground in front of him. The sword is positioned diagonally, with the tip pointing toward the lower right corner of the scene. The grip and stance suggest a formal, static pose, typical of ceremonial or symbolic representations. The blade appears straight and elongated, consistent with a longsword design. The positioning matches the description of holding the sword in the right hand and resting it on the ground.",

      "question": "Are there two arched niches on either side of the central gate, each containing a relief sculpture of an armored figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a detailed stone gate structure with two symmetrical arched niches flanking the central archway. Each niche contains a relief sculpture of a figure clad in armor, standing upright and holding what appears to be a weapon or shield. These figures are stylized but clearly represent armored warriors, possibly guards or knights, carved into the stonework. The architectural style and placement of these reliefs are consistent with medieval or fantasy castle designs, where such figures serve both decorative and symbolic purposes. The symmetry and detail confirm their presence and purpose.",

      "question": "Is there an armored figure standing atop the battlement, holding a red banner with a golden emblem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the battlement in Image B, directly above the central gate, there is a small armored figure positioned on the crenellations. This figure is holding a vertical flagpole with a red banner attached. The banner features a golden emblem, though the specific details of the emblem are not fully discernible due to scale. The figure's posture and equipment suggest a guard or sentinel role, common in fortified structures. The presence of this figure and the banner is consistent with medieval fortifications where banners were used to display allegiance or identity.",

      "question": "Is the knight positioned in a side profile view, facing to the right of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight is shown in a clear side profile, with his body oriented so that the left side of his face and torso are visible to the viewer. He is facing toward the right side of the frame, with his gaze directed forward and slightly to the right. This orientation is consistent with a classic profile pose often used in portraiture and figurative art to convey dignity and authority. The angle of his armor, cape, and sword further supports this interpretation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The battlement at the top of the gate in Image B features a red banner mounted on a pole. The banner displays a golden emblem, which, although not fully detailed, is recognizable as a symbol—possibly a coat of arms or heraldic device—commonly associated with nobility or kingdoms. The banner is unfurled and appears to be fluttering slightly, indicating wind or movement within the scene. Its placement at the highest point of the structure emphasizes its symbolic importance, aligning with historical practices of displaying flags atop castles or gates.",
