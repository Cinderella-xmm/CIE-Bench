      "question": "Are there four clock faces, one on each visible side of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower is depicted in a cartoon style with two visible clock faces on the front and right sides. However, only two clock faces are clearly shown due to the perspective of the image. Clock towers typically have four clock faces, one on each side, but since this is a 2D illustration and only two sides are visible, we cannot confirm the presence of clocks on the other two sides. Based on architectural norms for such towers, it is likely that there are four clock faces, but the visual evidence in this image only confirms two. Therefore, without seeing all sides, we cannot definitively say 'Yes' based solely on what is visible.",

      "question": "Do the clock faces contain black Roman numerals arranged in a circular pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock faces are clearly visible and show numbers arranged in a circular pattern. The numerals appear to be Roman numerals (I, II, III, etc.) and are colored black against a white background. This matches common design features of traditional clock towers. The arrangement is consistent with standard analog clocks, where Roman numerals are used to mark the hours in a circular layout. Thus, based on the visual cues in the edited image, the description aligns with typical clock face design.",

      "question": "Is there a steeply pitched pyramidal roof topped with a finial at the very top of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof of the tower is depicted as a sharply angled, pointed structure resembling a pyramidal spire. It rises steeply from the top of the tower and culminates in a small decorative element at the peak, which is consistent with a finial. This is a common feature in Gothic or Victorian-style clock towers. The visual representation supports the presence of both a steeply pitched roof and a finial, matching architectural conventions seen in real-world examples like the Albert Memorial Clock Tower in Belfast.",

      "question": "Are there four arched openings at the base of the tower, one on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the tower shows two arched openings visible from the front view — one on the left and one on the right. These arches are supported by columns and allow passage underneath. While only two arches are visible due to the angle of the image, architectural symmetry suggests that there would likely be two more on the opposite side. However, since only two are directly visible, and no indication of the other two is present in the image, we cannot confirm the existence of four arches based solely on visual evidence. The image does not provide enough information to assert that there are four arches.",

      "question": "Is the tower located at the center of a circular road with vehicles traveling around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower is positioned in the middle of a roundabout, with curved road markings forming a circular path around it. Vehicles are shown driving along this circular road, indicating that the tower is indeed situated at the center of a roundabout. This layout is consistent with real-world urban planning, where prominent structures like clock towers are sometimes placed in central traffic circles. The visual cues — curved lanes, dashed lines, and cars moving in a loop — confirm that the tower is at the center of a circular road.",

      "question": "Are there multiple cars visible on the road surrounding the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several cars are clearly visible on the circular road around the tower. There are at least five distinct vehicles shown — some approaching, others receding — distributed along the roundabout. These include a dark-colored car on the left, a white car on the right, and additional cars in the background. The presence of multiple vehicles confirms that the road is active and used for traffic flow. This aligns with typical urban scenes where roundabouts host ongoing vehicular movement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees lining the road behind the tower are illustrated with full green foliage. They appear lush and leafy, suggesting a spring or summer season. There are no visible signs of bare branches or sparse leaves. While some trees in the distance may have slightly less dense canopies, overall the foliage is abundant. This contrasts with winter or early spring conditions where trees might be bare. Therefore, based on the visual representation, the trees do not have bare or sparse foliage.",
