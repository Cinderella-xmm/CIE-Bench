    "Question": "Q1: Is the treasure chest depicted with an arched top and horizontal metal bands secured by brass rivets?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the treasure chest is illustrated in a detailed sketch style on what appears to be aged parchment. The chest has a clearly defined arched top, which is typical of traditional pirate or medieval-style treasure chests. Horizontal metal bands run across the length of the chest, and these bands are secured with small circular elements that resemble rivets. These rivets are consistently spaced and appear metallic, consistent with brass or similar material used in historical chest construction. This design aligns with common depictions of treasure chests in maritime lore and adventure themes. Therefore, based on visual cues and world knowledge of such artifacts, the description matches.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is there an ornate lock mechanism present on the right front panel of the chest?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right front panel of the chest displays a decorative, intricate lock mechanism. It includes a central knob-like component with surrounding detailing that suggests a keyhole and possibly a latch system. The design is stylized yet recognizable as a locking apparatus, often seen in antique chests.

    "Question": "Q5: Are gold coins, colorful gemstones, and small golden pottery vessels visible near the base of the chest?",
    "explanation": "Near the base of the chest in Image B, there is a scattered collection of objects that include round, shiny items resembling gold coins, multi-colored gemstones (in hues of blue, red, green, etc.), and small cylindrical vessels that look like miniature golden pots or jars. These elements are arranged around the lower front of the chest, suggesting spilled treasure. The artistic rendering uses highlights and reflections to convey their material properties, consistent with valuable loot. This matches the description in the question.",

    "Question": "Q6: Is the treasure chest positioned between the coiled rope knot and the pile of coins and gems?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the layout shows the coiled rope knot on the left side of the chest, and the pile of coins and gems on the right side, at the base of the chest. The chest itself occupies the central area, effectively placing it between these two elements. The spatial arrangement is balanced and symmetrical, reinforcing the idea that the chest is centrally located relative to both the rope and the treasure. Thus, the chest is indeed positioned between them.",

    "Question": "Q7: Are vertical rigging ropes and partially visible sails present in the background behind the chest?",
    "explanation": "Image B is a stylized illustration on parchment with a map-like background featuring sketched ships, sea monsters, and navigational symbols. However, there are no visible vertical rigging ropes or sails in the background behind the chest. Instead, the background consists of faint lines suggesting landmasses and sea routes, along with decorative ship illustrations at the corners. These are not actual rigging or sails but symbolic representations. Therefore, the presence of real rigging and sails as described is absent in this image.",
