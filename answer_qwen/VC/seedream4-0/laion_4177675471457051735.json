      "question": "Is the deep burgundy lip color present on the subject's lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's lips are clearly visible and display a rich, deep burgundy shade. This color is consistent with classic makeup choices for formal or historical portraits, where bold lip colors are used to emphasize facial features. The hue appears smooth and evenly applied, suggesting intentional styling. Based on visual cues alone, the lip color is unmistakably deep burgundy, matching the description.",

      "question": "Is the black beaded mesh veil covering the forehead and extending over the eyes present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the subject with an elaborate hairstyle that includes pearls and intricate braiding, but there is no black beaded mesh veil visible. The forehead and eyes are fully exposed, with no netting or veil present. In contrast, such veils are often seen in modern fashion events (like those worn by celebrities at galas), but they are not part of traditional or historical portraiture styles like this one. Therefore, based on the visual evidence, the veil is absent.",

      "question": "Are large, dangling earrings attached to the earlobes, featuring a multi-tiered, ornate structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B is wearing jewelry around the neck—a pearl necklace—but no earrings are visible. The earlobes are not adorned with any hanging or multi-tiered accessories. In historical portraits of noblewomen, earrings were sometimes included, but in this case, the focus is on the necklace and the hairstyle. There is no visual indication of large, dangling earrings. Thus, the presence of such earrings cannot be confirmed.",

      "question": "Are the eyes positioned symmetrically, with a prominent nose and defined jawline visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s face is presented in a three-quarter view, showing both eyes, which appear to be symmetrically aligned. The nose is well-defined and proportionate, and the jawline is clearly visible and structured, contributing to a balanced facial profile. These features are typical of classical portraiture, where symmetry and clarity of facial features are emphasized. Based on visual analysis, the facial structure meets the described criteria.",

      "question": "Does the gown feature a deep V-neckline with triangular spike embellishments along the edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gown in Image B has a square neckline with lace trim and decorative embroidery, rather than a deep V-neckline. Additionally, there are no triangular spike embellishments visible along the edges. Instead, the dress features ornate gold embroidery and floral patterns, characteristic of 17th- or 18th-century fashion. The neckline style and embellishments do not match the description provided. Therefore, the claim about the V-neckline and spikes is inaccurate.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B has a warm, even skin tone that appears smooth and free of blemishes or discoloration. The lighting in the portrait enhances the natural glow of the skin, which is typical in fine art portraiture aiming to depict idealized beauty. There are no visible signs of uneven pigmentation, redness, or other imperfections. The overall appearance suggests careful artistic rendering to maintain a uniform and flattering complexion.",
