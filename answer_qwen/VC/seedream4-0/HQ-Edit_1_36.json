      "question": "Does the edited image retain the distinct network of wrinkles around the eyes and mouth of the elderly woman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly woman's facial features are stylized in a cartoonish or animated manner. Her skin appears smooth with minimal texture, and the fine lines and deep wrinkles typically associated with an elderly person—especially around the eyes (crow's feet) and mouth—are significantly reduced or absent. Instead, her face has exaggerated, rounded features common in animated characters, such as large expressive eyes and soft cheeks. This artistic style prioritizes a youthful and cheerful expression over realistic aging details. Therefore, based on visual cues and knowledge of animation aesthetics, the distinct network of wrinkles is not retained.",

      "question": "Is the silver-gray hair styled in a traditional updo with a clear central part and rounded bun at the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s hair is indeed silver-gray and neatly arranged. It is parted down the middle and swept into a symmetrical, rounded updo that resembles a traditional Korean hairstyle often seen in historical or cultural depictions. The hair is voluminous and well-defined, forming a soft bun at the back of the head, consistent with formal styles worn with hanbok. This aligns with traditional Korean aesthetics for elder women, where modesty and elegance are emphasized through structured hairstyles. The visual clarity of the central part and the shape of the bun confirm this styling.",

      "question": "Is the white collar of the jeogori clearly visible and forming a V-shape at the neckline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jeogori in Image B features a prominent white collar that extends from the shoulders and meets at the center of the chest, creating a distinct V-shape. This design is characteristic of traditional Korean hanbok, where the collar is typically wide and stiff to maintain structure. In this image, the collar is clearly outlined against the pastel-colored fabric of the outer layer, and its sharp, clean edges form a clear V-shape at the neckline. This matches both visual observation and cultural knowledge of hanbok construction.",

      "question": "Is there a coral-colored ribbon bow located at the center of the chest, tied in a neat knot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the center of the chest in Image B, there is a clearly visible ribbon tied into a bow. The color is a soft coral or peach tone, which contrasts gently with the pastel blue and pink hues of the jeogori. The bow is symmetrically tied and positioned directly over the V-neckline, serving as a decorative element typical of traditional Korean attire. Its neatness and placement suggest it is meant to be a focal point of the garment’s design. Based on both visual evidence and cultural understanding of hanbok accessories, this description is accurate.",

      "question": "Are there visible floral embroidery patterns along the inner edge of the jeogori, featuring pink, purple, and red flowers on a greenish-gray background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Along the inner edge of the jeogori in Image B, there is a detailed strip of fabric with floral embroidery. The pattern includes various flowers in shades of pink, purple, and red, set against a muted greenish-gray background. These embroidered designs are consistent with traditional Korean textile art, where nature-inspired motifs like flowers are commonly used. The visibility and arrangement of these elements confirm their presence and match the described colors and layout. This detail adds authenticity to the garment’s design.",

      "question": "Is the elderly woman standing upright and facing directly toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is positioned frontally, with her body oriented straight toward the camera. Her head is slightly tilted upward, and her gaze is directed forward, engaging the viewer directly. Her posture is upright, suggesting confidence and poise. There is no indication of a side angle or tilt in her stance. This frontal composition is typical in portrait-style illustrations, especially in animated or stylized representations, where direct engagement is emphasized. Based on the alignment of her shoulders, head, and eyes, she is indeed facing directly toward the viewer.",

      "question": "Is the outer jeogori visibly layered over an inner garment, creating a translucent effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outer jeogori in Image B appears to be made of a sheer or semi-transparent fabric, allowing glimpses of the inner garment beneath. The translucency is particularly noticeable in the sleeves and upper torso, where the underlying layer shows through with subtle color variations. This layering technique is common in traditional Korean fashion, especially in ceremonial hanbok, where multiple layers create depth and elegance. The visual cue of light passing through the fabric, combined with the visible contrast between the outer and inner garments, confirms the presence of a translucent layering effect.",
