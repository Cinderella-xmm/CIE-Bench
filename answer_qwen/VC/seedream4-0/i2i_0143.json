      "question": "Is the \"PARKING\" label clearly visible on the parking meter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'PARKING' label is located at the top of the parking meter, within a circular display area. In Image B, this label is clearly legible and positioned prominently. The text is in uppercase, bold font, and is not obscured by glare or any other object. Despite the sun's position creating a slight lens flare above the meter, the label remains readable due to its high contrast against the background. This visibility is consistent with standard design practices for parking meters, where clarity is essential for public understanding. Therefore, based on visual cues and common design principles, the label is clearly visible.",

      "question": "Does the sticker on the parking meter display the text \"ComsiAcara\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sticker located in the central section of the parking meter contains multiple lines of text. Upon close inspection, the most prominent word in red text is 'ComsiAcara', which appears to be the name of an organization or company. The text is centered and clearly printed, matching the style typical of official notices or service provider labels. The surrounding smaller text appears to be additional information, possibly related to maintenance or regulations. Given that the text is legible and matches the exact spelling provided in the question, it can be confirmed that the sticker does display 'ComsiAcara'.",

      "question": "Is the parking meter securely attached and standing upright on a pole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parking meter is mounted on a vertical black pole, which appears to be firmly fixed into the ground. The meter itself is aligned vertically and shows no signs of tilting or leaning. Its structural integrity is intact, with no visible damage or deformation. The base of the meter connects seamlessly to the pole, indicating a secure attachment. In real-world contexts, parking meters are typically installed this way to prevent theft or tampering. The absence of any wobbling or instability in the image further supports that it is securely and uprightly mounted.",

      "question": "Does the parking meter retain its original size and structural proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parking meter in Image B exhibits standard dimensions and proportions consistent with typical urban parking meters. It has a symmetrical, elongated rectangular body with a rounded top, housing the display, coin slot, and informational stickers. There is no distortion such as stretching, compression, or scaling errors. The relative sizes of components (e.g., the display window, coin slot, and label area) are proportionally accurate. Additionally, the perspective suggests a realistic depth and scale, without any visual anomalies that would indicate resizing or warping. Based on these observations and knowledge of standard parking meter designs, the meter retains its original size and structural proportions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B indicates a bright, sunny environment with the sun positioned high and slightly behind the meter, casting light from the upper rear. However, despite the strong illumination, there is no visible shadow of the parking meter on the ground beneath it. Shadows are typically cast when an object blocks direct sunlight, but in this case, the ground surface around the base of the meter is uniformly lit, with no darkened area corresponding to the meterâ€™s silhouette. This could be due to the angle of the sun being directly overhead or the image being edited to remove shadows. Based on visual evidence alone, the shadow is not present.",
