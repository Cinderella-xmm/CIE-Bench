      "question": "Is the dress clearly divided into a red upper section and a dark blue lower section, forming a visible gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's dress is visually distinct in its color division. The upper portion of the dress is a vibrant red, which transitions sharply into a deep navy blue at the lower part of the skirt. This transition is not a smooth gradient but rather a clear demarcation line between the two colors. The contrast is strong and intentional, suggesting a deliberate design choice rather than a blended gradient. Based on visual inspection, there is no gradual blending of red to blue; instead, it appears as two separate color blocks. Therefore, while the dress has both red and blue sections, it does not form a visible gradient.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dress appear to be in motion, with the fabric fanning outward and upward as if caught in a twirl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B exhibits dynamic movement. The fabric of the skirt flares out dramatically, with layers lifting upward and outward from the body, especially on the right side. This suggests rotational motion, consistent with a twirling action. Additionally, the flow of the fabric and the positioning of the arms imply momentum. The way the material drapes and lifts indicates that the dress is being moved by an energetic motion, likely spinning. This effect is further enhanced by the floating petals, which contribute to the sense of motion in the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the woman’s right arm extended forward and her left arm raised, with her left hand lifting the edge of the dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the pose of the woman in Image B, her right arm is indeed extended forward, pointing slightly downward. Her left arm is raised and bent at the elbow, with her left hand grasping the edge of the dress near the hem. This gesture lifts the fabric, contributing to the dynamic appearance of the skirt. The positioning of the arms aligns with a classic twirling pose, where one arm leads and the other controls the dress. Thus, both conditions described in the question are met.",

      "question": "Does the woman have long, wavy, golden-brown hair flowing behind her?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B has long, voluminous hair that cascades down her back and flows outward, indicating motion. The hair is styled in loose waves and has a golden-brown hue, consistent with sunlight reflecting off it. The strands appear to be lifted and spread by the movement, suggesting she is in motion. The coloration and texture are typical of animated or stylized representations of flowing hair, and the direction of the flow matches the implied rotation of the figure.",

      "question": "Are there dense clusters of pink flowers on the left side and yellow spherical flowers on the right side of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left side of the frame features large, dense clusters of pink flowers, including roses and other blossoms, arranged along the border. On the right side, particularly in the foreground, there are numerous yellow spherical flowers resembling marigolds or chrysanthemums. These are grouped closely together, creating a vibrant contrast with the pink blooms. The distribution of these flower types is asymmetrical, with pink dominating the left and yellow the right, supporting the description in the question.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a bright, warm light source coming from the top right, illuminating the woman and casting a golden glow on the right side of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a strong light source originating from the top right corner, characterized by radiant beams and a soft glow. This light casts a golden hue across the right side of the composition, particularly illuminating the woman’s face, hair, and the yellow flowers. The lighting creates highlights on the dress and enhances the warmth of the scene. The directional nature of the light, combined with its brightness and color temperature, indicates a warm, possibly sun-like source positioned above and to the right.",

      "question": "Does the woman have closed eyes, a gentle smile, and a visible silver hoop earring on her left ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B has her eyes gently closed, contributing to a serene and joyful expression. She displays a soft, pleasant smile, reinforcing the peaceful mood of the scene. On her left ear, a silver hoop earring is clearly visible, hanging from the lobe. The earring is reflective and matches the overall artistic style of the image. All three elements—closed eyes, gentle smile, and visible earring—are present and consistent with the description.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Throughout Image B, numerous pink petals are scattered in the air, particularly around the woman’s head and dress. These petals appear to be falling or drifting, adding to the sense of motion and whimsy. They vary in size and orientation, suggesting they were released from nearby flowers. The presence of these petals enhances the magical, dreamlike quality of the scene. Their distribution is consistent with natural petal dispersion during movement or wind.",
