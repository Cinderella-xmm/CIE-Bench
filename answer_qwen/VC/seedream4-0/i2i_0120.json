      "question": "Is the Bulbasaur figurine primarily green with darker green diamond patterns on its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Bulbasaur figurine is clearly depicted in a light green color, consistent with its canonical design. Darker green diamond-shaped markings are visible across its back, head, and limbs, which align with the standard appearance of Bulbasaur in the Pokémon franchise. These patterns are not merely decorative but serve as distinguishing features of the character's design. The lighting in the image enhances the contrast between the lighter base color and the darker patches, making them stand out. Based on visual inspection and world knowledge of Bulbasaur’s iconic look, these markings are accurately represented. This matches the known design from both official artwork and merchandise.",

      "question": "Does the Bulbasaur figurine retain its red eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B has bright red eyes with white sclera and black pupils, consistent with Bulbasaur's classic design. In the Pokémon series, Bulbasaur is known for its striking red eyes, which are a key part of its recognizable appearance. The figurine preserves this feature, ensuring visual fidelity to the original character. Even under natural lighting conditions in the scene, the red color remains vivid and distinct. Comparing this to typical depictions in animation or official media, the eye color is accurately maintained. There is no evidence of color alteration or stylization that would deviate from the original design.",

      "question": "Is there a plant bulb with visible leaves on the Bulbasaur figurine's back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B shows a large green bulb on its back, which is characteristic of Bulbasaur. This bulb is textured and appears slightly rounded, resembling a seed pod or plant bulb. While the surface details suggest it may be smooth, there are subtle leaf-like structures emerging from the top of the bulb, indicating the beginning of plant growth. In the Pokémon universe, this bulb is where the plant part of Bulbasaur originates, and its presence is essential to the character’s identity. The depiction here aligns with canonical representations—though simplified for a figurine form, the bulb is clearly present and includes hints of foliage. Therefore, the bulb is identifiable as having visible leaf elements, albeit stylized.",

      "question": "Does the Bulbasaur figurine have an open mouth with a visible tongue, maintaining a cheerful expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B displays an open mouth with a pink tongue visible inside, contributing to a wide, smiling expression. This cheerful demeanor is consistent with how Bulbasaur is often portrayed in media—friendly and approachable. The mouth is curved upward, and the teeth are small and sharp, adding to the playful yet slightly fierce cartoonish charm. This expression matches the character’s typical portrayal in animations and games, where it often appears happy or excited. The lighting highlights the inner mouth and tongue, reinforcing the impression of a joyful face. Thus, the figurine maintains the cheerful expression through its facial features.",

      "question": "Are the claws on the Bulbasaur figurine's feet still shaped like small triangles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the figurine’s feet in Image B, the claws appear as small, pointed, white protrusions at the tips of each toe. These claws are distinctly triangular in shape, matching the stylized design commonly seen in Bulbasaur illustrations and merchandise. The triangular form is consistent with the character’s animated depiction, where simplicity and clarity of design are prioritized. Although the figurine is three-dimensional and may have slight rounding due to manufacturing, the overall shape remains triangular. This detail is preserved across various official renderings, so the representation here is accurate.",
