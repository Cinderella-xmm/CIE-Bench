      "question": "Is Ultraman’s suit rendered in red and silver?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Ultraman is depicted inside a snowglobe-like sphere. His suit is clearly visible and consists of a white base with red accents on the chest, shoulders, legs, and arms. The color scheme is predominantly red and white, not silver. Silver is typically associated with metallic or reflective surfaces, but the suit here does not appear to have a silver tone; it is more accurately described as white with red highlights. Therefore, based on visual analysis and common knowledge of Ultraman's design, the suit is not rendered in red and silver.",

      "question": "Does Ultraman have a yellow oval eye on his helmet and a blue gem on his chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Ultraman’s helmet features a prominent yellow oval-shaped eye, which is consistent with the classic design of Ultraman characters. Additionally, there is a distinct blue circular gem located at the center of his chest, which is a signature feature of Ultraman’s suit. This combination of a yellow oval eye and a blue chest gem aligns with the established visual identity of Ultraman across various media. Thus, both features are present and correctly rendered.",

      "question": "Does the monster have bat-like wings and a wide-open mouth with visible fangs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The monster inside the snowglobe has large, wing-like appendages that resemble bat wings, with a leathery texture and pointed tips. Its mouth is wide open, revealing sharp fangs and a pink interior, which is typical of kaiju designs in Ultraman media. These characteristics—bat-like wings and a fanged, open mouth—are consistent with the depiction of many Ultraman monsters (kaiju), such as Gigan or similar creatures. Therefore, the monster in Image B matches this description.",

      "question": "Is there metallic debris or a ruined structure visible at the base of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the base of the snowglobe in Image B, there is a rocky platform scattered with metallic fragments, including what appear to be broken mechanical parts, bolts, and pieces of machinery. These elements suggest destruction or wreckage, possibly from a battle. The presence of these metallic objects indicates a ruined structure or debris field, which is commonly used in collectible displays to evoke a sense of aftermath or conflict. Hence, metallic debris is indeed visible.",

      "question": "Is the artist signature \"Arthur Adams 10-17-2020\" present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork is contained within a snowglobe, and the base of the globe is designed to resemble a rocky surface with debris. There is no visible signature or date inscribed on the globe or its base. In contrast, Image A (the original comic cover) clearly shows the artist signature 'Arthur Adams 10-17-2020' near the bottom left corner. However, in Image B, this signature is absent due to the transformation into a collectible snowglobe format, which likely omits such details for aesthetic or production reasons. Therefore, the signature is not present in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top portion of the snowglobe contains etched text that reads 'MARVEL', 'ULTRAMAN', and 'THE TRIALS OF ULTRAMAN'. These words are engraved on the glass surface of the globe, matching the title and branding from the original comic cover (Image A). Although the style is different (etched rather than printed), the text is clearly legible and present. This suggests that the snowglobe is a themed collectible inspired by the comic, preserving the title information. Thus, all three phrases are indeed present.",

      "question": "Is Ultraman depicted in a forward-leaping pose with one arm extended?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Ultraman is standing upright inside the snowglobe, facing the monster. He is not in a dynamic leaping pose; instead, he appears to be in a neutral stance with both arms slightly bent and positioned close to his body. In contrast, Image A shows Ultraman in a dramatic forward-leaping pose with one arm extended, which is characteristic of action-oriented comic book covers. The snowglobe version simplifies the pose for display purposes, so the dynamic motion seen in Image A is absent here. Therefore, Ultraman is not depicted in a forward-leaping pose with one arm extended in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the background textures primarily greenish-yellow with organic, ribbed patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background inside the snowglobe features a starry space scene with swirling nebulae and planetary rings, not greenish-yellow organic patterns. The dominant colors are dark blues, blacks, and whites, simulating outer space. The texture is cosmic and celestial, not biological or ribbed. In contrast, Image A has a background filled with greenish-yellow, ribbed, organic structures resembling alien anatomy or a monstrous internal cavity. This difference arises because Image B is a stylized collectible representation focusing on a miniature scene, while Image A is a full comic cover with detailed environmental art. Thus, the background in Image B does not match the described texture.",
