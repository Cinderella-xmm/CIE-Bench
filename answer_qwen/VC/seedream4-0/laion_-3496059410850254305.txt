    "Question": "Q1: Is the Fender logo visible on the headstock?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the headstock of the guitar features a prominent emblem that includes a stylized flame-like symbol and a bird or phoenix motif, which is not consistent with the standard Fender logo. The Fender logo typically consists of the word 'Fender' in a cursive script or a simple block font, often accompanied by a small crown or similar design. However, in this image, the headstock displays a custom-looking insignia with a glowing orange flame and a bird shape, suggesting a fictional or stylized branding rather than the actual Fender logo. This conclusion is supported by world knowledge about Fender's trademarked design elements, which are absent here.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there exactly six strings running from the bridge to the tuning pegs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar has six strings visibly extending from the bridge at the bottom of the body to the tuning pegs on the headstock. Each string is clearly depicted as running along the fretboard and terminating at one of the six tuning pegs—three on each side of the headstock. This configuration matches the standard setup for a six-string acoustic guitar. There are no additional or missing strings, and the visual continuity of each string from bridge to peg confirms their presence. This aligns with common knowledge about standard acoustic guitars, which typically have six strings.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a cutaway on the upper right side of the guitar body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar body shows a distinct indentation or cutaway on the upper right side (from the viewer’s perspective), which allows easier access to the higher frets. This feature is characteristic of many modern acoustic guitars, especially those designed for lead playing. The cutaway is clearly visible as a curved section near the neck joint, curving inward toward the center of the body. This matches the typical design of a cutaway acoustic guitar, where the body is shaped to allow better reach to the upper frets. Based on visual evidence and general knowledge of guitar anatomy, this is confirmed as a cutaway.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the soundhole located in the center of the guitar body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the soundhole is positioned centrally on the guitar's body, directly beneath the strings and aligned with the centerline of the instrument. This placement is standard for acoustic guitars, where the soundhole is typically centered to optimize resonance and sound projection. The circular opening is surrounded by a rosette pattern, which is common in such designs. The symmetry of the guitar body and the alignment of the strings suggest that the soundhole is indeed centered. This aligns with general knowledge about acoustic guitar construction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the neck extend directly from the body to the headstock without significant deviation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the neck of the guitar appears to extend straight from the body to the headstock, maintaining a consistent angle and alignment. There is no visible kink, bend, or angular deviation in the neck’s structure. The transition from the body to the neck is smooth, and the fretboard runs in a straight line toward the headstock. This is typical of most acoustic guitars, where the neck is attached at a slight angle but remains structurally straight. Visual inspection confirms the absence of any abnormal curvature or offset.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there three tuning pegs on each side of the headstock?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the headstock has six tuning pegs in total, with three on the left side and three on the right side when viewed from the front. This is a common configuration for acoustic guitars, particularly those with a 3+3 tuning peg layout. Each string connects to one tuning peg, and the arrangement is symmetrical. The visual count confirms that there are exactly three tuning pegs per side. This matches the standard design for most six-string guitars, including Fender models, though the brand is not confirmed here.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Does the guitar body retain the classic dreadnought shape with a rounded lower bout and a cutaway on the upper right?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar body exhibits a broad, rounded lower bout, which is characteristic of the dreadnought style—a popular acoustic guitar body shape known for its full-bodied sound and large size. Additionally, there is a clear cutaway on the upper right side of the body, allowing access to higher frets. While the overall shape is consistent with a dreadnought, the presence of the cutaway modifies it into what is often called a 'cutaway dreadnought.' This combination of features—rounded lower bout and cutaway—is common in modern acoustic guitars designed for versatility. Thus, the guitar retains the core dreadnought shape while incorporating a cutaway.",
    "answer": "Yes"
