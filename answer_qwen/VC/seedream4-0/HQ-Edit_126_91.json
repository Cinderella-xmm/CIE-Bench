      "question": "Is the curved side profile of the grand piano preserved, maintaining its characteristic gentle arc and elongated form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grand piano exhibits a smooth, flowing side profile that curves gently from the front to the back, consistent with the classic design of a grand piano. The elongated form is clearly visible, extending horizontally across the frame. This shape is typical of grand pianos, where the body follows a graceful arc to accommodate the strings and soundboard. The curvature is not distorted or flattened, and the overall silhouette matches the expected proportions of such instruments. Based on visual cues and world knowledge about piano design, this feature is accurately represented.",

      "question": "Are the four tapered legs with decorative casters present and positioned beneath the piano body as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the piano has four distinct legs that taper downward, ending in what appear to be decorative casters or feet. These are positioned symmetrically under the piano body, one at each corner, which aligns with standard grand piano construction. The legs are dark, matching the piano’s finish, and their shape—narrowing toward the bottom—is consistent with traditional designs. While the exact detail of the casters is slightly obscured by lighting, their presence is implied by the small golden accents at the base of each leg, which resemble ornamental casters. This configuration matches typical grand piano anatomy.",

      "question": "Is the piano positioned directly in the center of the corridor, aligned with the vanishing point created by the columns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano is placed centrally along the length of the corridor, facing forward toward the viewer. The perspective lines formed by the marble columns on both sides converge toward a central vanishing point in the background, and the piano is aligned directly along this axis. Its placement ensures symmetry relative to the surrounding architecture, reinforcing a sense of balance and grandeur. This alignment is intentional and visually harmonious, typical of staged architectural photography or product presentation in opulent settings. Therefore, the piano is indeed centered and aligned with the vanishing point.",

      "question": "Is the floor composed of large square tiles arranged in a repeating pattern of alternating dark and light shades?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor in Image B features large, polished marble tiles with a natural veining pattern, primarily in white and gray tones. However, there is no clear repeating pattern of alternating dark and light squares. Instead, the flooring appears to be continuous marble slabs with subtle variations in color and texture due to the stone's natural grain. The surface reflects light uniformly, suggesting a single material rather than a geometric tile layout. Thus, while the floor is tiled in a large format, it does not follow a checkerboard or alternating shade pattern as described.",

      "question": "Are there tall, evenly spaced white columns extending along both sides of the corridor, forming a symmetrical passage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a grand hallway lined with tall, classical-style columns made of white marble with gray veining. These columns are evenly spaced along both sides of the corridor, creating a symmetrical and balanced architectural structure. Each column features a capital with ornate detailing, typical of Corinthian or Ionic orders, contributing to the luxurious ambiance. The repetition and alignment of these columns guide the eye toward the vanishing point, reinforcing the sense of depth and order. This arrangement is consistent with neoclassical or palatial interior design.",

      "question": "Does the piano retain a highly reflective, glossy black surface that mirrors the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The piano in Image B has a deep black, polished finish that reflects light and nearby elements such as the columns, ceiling lights, and floor. The surface captures clear reflections, including the ambient glow from overhead lighting and the faint outlines of architectural details. This high-gloss finish is characteristic of premium grand pianos, especially those used in formal or luxury settings. The reflections are sharp enough to indicate a mirror-like quality, confirming that the surface is indeed highly reflective.",

      "question": "Are soft shadows cast beneath the piano and along the floor, consistent with overhead lighting from above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, soft shadows are visible beneath the piano, particularly under its legs and body, indicating illumination from above. The lighting appears to come from recessed ceiling fixtures, as evidenced by the even distribution of light and the subtle gradient of shadow intensity. The shadows are diffused rather than harsh, suggesting the use of indirect or softened overhead lighting. This creates a realistic and elegant atmosphere, consistent with interior spaces designed for high-end presentations. The shadow patterns align with the direction of the light source, supporting the conclusion that the lighting is overhead and produces soft shadows.",
