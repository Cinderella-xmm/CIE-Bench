      "question": "Is the orange circular lifebuoy still present and clearly visible in the same position near the netting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange circular lifebuoy is no longer present in its original location near the netting. Instead, it has been creatively repurposed as part of a large sand sculpture of a fish-like creature. The lifebuoy is now used as the eye of the sculpture, with white foam or material around it to simulate eyelashes and an eye socket. This transformation indicates that while the lifebuoy itself is still visible, it is no longer in its original position or context. Therefore, it is not present in the same position near the netting.",

      "question": "Is the dark mesh netting still visible along the shoreline, connected by vertical poles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark mesh netting that was previously visible along the shoreline in Image A is no longer present. The area where the netting was located is now occupied by a large sand sculpture of a fish. The vertical poles that supported the netting are also absent, likely removed or obscured by the construction of the sculpture. This suggests that the netting has been replaced or removed entirely for the purpose of creating the artwork. Thus, the netting is not visible in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the shoreline maintain its original diagonal slope from the bottom left to the top right of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoreline still follows a diagonal slope from the bottom left to the top right of the frame, consistent with the composition of Image A. While the presence of the sand sculpture alters the immediate surface texture and adds a new focal point, the overall orientation and angle of the shoreline remain unchanged. The natural contour of the beach and the water's edge continue to define this diagonal line, indicating that the fundamental spatial structure of the scene has been preserved despite the addition of the sculpture.",

      "question": "Is the orange lifebuoy physically connected to one of the vertical poles of the netting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange lifebuoy is no longer attached to any vertical pole. Instead, it has been integrated into the sand sculpture as the eye of the fish-like figure. The lifebuoy is now fixed onto the sculptureâ€™s head, serving as a decorative and functional artistic element. There are no visible poles or netting structures in the vicinity of the lifebuoy, meaning it is not physically connected to any vertical pole. This confirms that the connection to the pole seen in Image A no longer exists.",

      "question": "Are there visible white foam patterns in the water immediately adjacent to the shoreline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, white foam patterns are still visible in the water near the shoreline. The waves continue to break gently against the beach, producing frothy white foam as they recede. These foam patterns are consistent with typical coastal dynamics and are clearly visible in the foreground of the image, particularly around the base of the sand sculpture. This matches the natural behavior of ocean waves and aligns with what would be expected in such a setting, even with the addition of the sculpture.",

      "question": "Is the sand along the shoreline still light beige in color, without significant discoloration or tinting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sand along the shoreline remains light beige in color, consistent with the appearance in Image A. The sand sculpture is made from the same material, and there is no evidence of artificial coloring or discoloration affecting the surrounding beach. The lighting conditions appear natural, and the sand retains its uniform tone, suggesting that no significant tinting or alteration has occurred. Therefore, the sand maintains its original coloration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical poles that were previously supporting the netting are no longer visible. The netting itself has been removed or obscured by the creation of the sand sculpture. As a result, none of the poles can be seen in the current image. Since the poles are absent, it is impossible to determine their spacing or count. Therefore, the condition of having at least three evenly spaced poles is not met.",
