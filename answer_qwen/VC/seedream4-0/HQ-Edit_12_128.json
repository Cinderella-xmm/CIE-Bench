      "question": "Is the clock face circular and positioned in the center of the wooden frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is indeed circular, as seen from its round shape with a consistent radius. It is centrally located within the transparent frame, which mirrors the structure of traditional wall clocks. The symmetry of the design, with ornamental elements evenly distributed around the clock face, supports the conclusion that the face is centered. Although the frame is made of clear material rather than wood (as in Image A), the spatial arrangement remains consistent with classic clock design principles where the dial is centrally placed for balance and readability.",

      "question": "Are the Roman numerals arranged in clockwise order from I to XII around the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the Roman numerals are clearly visible on the clock face and follow the standard clockwise sequence starting from I at the top right and progressing through II, III, ..., up to XII at the top. This arrangement is consistent with conventional analog clock design, where time progresses clockwise. The placement of the numerals is uniform and correctly ordered, matching real-world expectations for timekeeping devices.",

      "question": "Does the pendulum hang directly below the clock face, supported by two vertical rods?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pendulum is visibly suspended beneath the clock face by two thin vertical rods. These rods extend downward from the bottom center of the clock frame, connecting to a large, faceted crystal ball that serves as the pendulum bob. The alignment is perfectly vertical and centered, indicating it hangs directly below the clock face. This configuration is typical of pendulum clocks, where the pendulum’s position ensures stable oscillation and accurate timekeeping.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two fluted columns, one on each side of the clock face, extending from the top to the bottom of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two vertical structures on either side of the clock face that resemble columns. They feature fluting—vertical grooves along their length—which is characteristic of classical architectural columns. These columns extend from near the top of the frame down to the base, supporting the overall structure. While they are made of transparent material instead of wood, their form and function match those of fluted columns in traditional designs. Thus, they fulfill the structural and aesthetic role described.",

      "question": "Is there a decorative crest with leaf-like carvings located at the top center of the clock frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the apex of the clock frame in Image B, there is an ornate, symmetrical decoration composed of intricate, leaf-like patterns. This element is positioned precisely at the top center and resembles a crest or finial commonly found in baroque or rococo-style furniture and clocks. Despite being made of transparent material, the design clearly mimics carved foliage, fulfilling the visual and stylistic purpose of a decorative crest.",

      "question": "Is there a circular medallion located at the center of the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The center of the clock face in Image B features a distinct circular area that appears slightly recessed or textured compared to the rest of the dial. While not deeply engraved like in some antique clocks, this central circle contains subtle detailing and acts as a focal point. In traditional clock design, such a medallion often houses the pivot point for the hands or decorative engraving. Its presence here aligns with common design practices, even if it lacks elaborate ornamentation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the lower corners of the clock frame in Image B, there are two small, rounded protrusions that extend downward. These elements resemble feet or finials and are symmetrically placed on both sides of the base. They serve both a decorative and functional purpose, possibly helping to stabilize the clock when mounted or enhancing its aesthetic appeal. Their shape and placement are consistent with traditional clock design, even though they are made of transparent material.",
