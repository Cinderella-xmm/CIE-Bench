    "Question": "Q1: Is the lid of the piano open and angled upward, revealing the internal structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object in the foreground is not a real piano but a gingerbread cookie shaped like a piano. The 'lid' of this cookie is closed and does not appear to be angled upward. Instead, it is flat and decorated with icing that mimics ornate architectural details. There is no visible internal structure because the object is not a functional piano but a decorative edible item. Therefore, the lid is not open or angled upward.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the piano have four legs, each ending in a golden caster, supporting the body?",
    "explanation": "The object in Image B is a gingerbread cookie designed to resemble a piano. It lacks physical legs entirelyâ€”instead, it is placed on a marble table. Real pianos typically have three or four legs with casters, but this is an artistic representation made of food, so it does not possess actual structural components like legs or casters. Thus, it does not meet the criteria of having four legs with golden casters.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are there exactly three pedals positioned in a row beneath the keyboard?",
    "explanation": "The object in Image B is a gingerbread cookie shaped like a piano. While the bottom edge of the cookie features a pattern resembling piano keys, there are no pedals visible beneath it. In reality, grand pianos have three pedals (sustain, sostenuto, and soft), but this is a stylized edible model. Since the cookie is two-dimensional and lacks depth, it cannot include pedals. Therefore, there are no pedals present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the keys arranged in the standard piano pattern of alternating white and black keys across the full length of the keyboard?",
    "explanation": "The gingerbread cookie in Image B has a section at the bottom that resembles piano keys, using black and white icing to simulate them. However, the arrangement appears simplified and stylized rather than accurate. The number of keys is limited, and the spacing and pattern do not fully replicate the standard piano keyboard layout, which includes repeating groups of seven white keys and five black keys per octave. This is clearly a decorative approximation, not a precise representation. Hence, the keys are not arranged in the standard piano pattern.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a music stand attached to the top front edge of the piano body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gingerbread cookie is shaped like a piano but lacks any additional structures such as a music stand. A real piano often has a music stand attached to its front, but this edible model is a simplified, artistic rendition. No such feature is visible on the cookie, which focuses on decorative elements like arches and keys rather than functional parts. Therefore, there is no music stand present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the lid connected to the piano body via a visible hinge mechanism near the rear edge of the keyboard?",
    "explanation": "The gingerbread cookie in Image B does not have a functional lid or mechanical hinge. The 'lid' is part of the cookie's shape and is fixed, not articulated. In a real piano, the lid is hinged to allow it to open and close, but this is a static edible object. There is no visible hinge or joint connecting the lid to the body, as such mechanisms would not be feasible in a cookie. Therefore, there is no visible hinge mechanism.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the piano maintain the same elongated, curved-body silhouette and proportional dimensions as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the piano is a real grand piano with a long, curved body and typical proportions for such instruments. In Image B, the object is a gingerbread cookie shaped to resemble a piano, but it is significantly smaller and more stylized. Its silhouette is simplified and lacks the smooth curves and realistic proportions of a real piano. The cookie is more ornamental and less anatomically accurate, especially in terms of scale and detail. Therefore, while it mimics the general shape, it does not maintain the same elongated, curved-body silhouette and proportional dimensions as the original piano.",
    "answer": "No"
