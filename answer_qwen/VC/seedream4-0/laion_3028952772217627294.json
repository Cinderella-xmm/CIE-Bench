      "question": "Is the cactus rendered in green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus is clearly visible and is made of yarn or fabric, consistent with a knitted or crocheted toy. Its primary color is a bright, vibrant green, which is typical for representations of cacti in toys or amigurumi. The green coloration is uniform across the body of the cactus, including its arms, and there are no other dominant colors on its surface. This aligns with common artistic depictions of cacti, where green is the standard color to represent plant life. Therefore, based on visual evidence and general knowledge about how cacti are represented in crafts, the cactus is indeed rendered in green.",

      "question": "Does the cactus wear a sombrero with horizontal stripes in purple, pink, light blue, and orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sombrero worn by the cactus in Image B is clearly visible and features multiple horizontal stripes. Observing the colors from top to bottom, we can identify the following sequence: orange at the tip, followed by purple, pink, light blue, and then another layer of purple and orange near the brim. These colors match the description provided in the question. The arrangement and presence of these specific colors confirm that the sombrero has horizontal stripes in purple, pink, light blue, and orange. This design is consistent with traditional Mexican-style sombreros often used in festive or cultural-themed crafts.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus has two small, round, red objects located at the ends of its arms. These objects are consistent in appearance with pom-poms, commonly used in crochet or knitting projects to add decorative elements. They are positioned symmetrically on both arms and appear to be sewn or attached securely. Given their shape, color, and placement, they are identifiable as red pom-poms. This detail is typical in playful or whimsical craft designs, especially for characters like this cactus.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pot holding the cactus in Image B is decorated with a patterned band around its middle. On the side of the pot, near the base, there is a small yellow star-shaped object. It appears to be sewn or glued onto the pot and stands out against the orange and turquoise background. This detail is consistent with decorative elements often added to handmade crafts to enhance visual appeal. The presence of the star matches the description in the question.",

      "question": "Does the donkey have vertical stripes in orange, pink, purple, and teal along its back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donkey is adorned with a colorful pattern along its back. Upon close inspection, the stripes run vertically down the animal’s back and are composed of alternating bands of orange, pink, purple, and teal. These colors are clearly distinguishable and follow a repeating pattern, matching the description in the question. The use of such vibrant, multicolored stripes is common in folk art-inspired or festive-themed amigurumi designs, particularly those reflecting Mexican or Latin American aesthetics. The orientation and color sequence confirm that the stripes are vertical and include the specified colors.",

      "question": "Do the donkey’s feet end in black hooves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The donkey in Image B has four legs, each ending in a dark-colored hoof. These hooves are distinctly black and contrast sharply with the gray fur of the donkey’s legs. The hooves are also outlined with white stitching, which adds definition and enhances their appearance. In real donkeys, hooves are typically dark (black or dark brown), so this representation is anatomically accurate. Additionally, in stuffed animal or amigurumi designs, black hooves are commonly used to mimic natural features. Thus, the donkey’s feet do end in black hooves.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The donkey in Image B has a distinct facial feature: the area around its nose and mouth is covered in white yarn or fabric, forming a muzzle. This white section contrasts with the gray body and is consistent with the natural coloring of many donkeys, which often have lighter muzzles. In toy design, especially in amigurumi, white muzzles are frequently used to highlight facial features and create a more expressive look. The white muzzle is clearly visible and matches the description in the question.",

      "question": "Does the donkey have a black mane and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donkey’s mane and tail are both made of black, spiky-looking fibers that resemble hair or yarn. The mane runs along the back of the neck and is upright, while the tail extends downward and ends in a tuft of black material. Both the mane and tail are consistently black, which is a common trait in many donkey breeds and is also typical in stylized representations. The texture and color suggest that they were intentionally crafted to stand out against the gray body. Therefore, the donkey does have a black mane and tail.",
