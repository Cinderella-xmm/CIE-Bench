      "question": "Is the sun-shaped ceiling light fixture present and positioned at the center of the ceiling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling features a prominent light fixture with a sun-like design, characterized by a central circular light surrounded by radiating spikes resembling sun rays. This fixture is clearly visible and appears to be centrally located within the grid-patterned ceiling tiles. Based on visual inspection, it is symmetrically placed relative to the room's layout, especially in relation to the bed and surrounding furniture. The design and placement are consistent with decorative lighting commonly used in themed or ornate interiors. Given that the fixture is both present and centered, this aligns with typical architectural symmetry in room design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a wooden bedside table is visible to the right side of the bed when viewed from the foot of the bed. It has a dark wood finish and includes a drawer and an open shelf below. On top of the table, there is a lamp with a patterned shade and a metallic base, along with a small flower vase containing red and green flowers. The positioning and contents match the description provided. This arrangement is common in bedroom settings for functional convenience and aesthetic appeal. The presence of both items confirms the accuracy of the description.",

      "question": "Is there a dark rectangular rug positioned directly beneath the bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a dark-colored rectangular rug is visible on the floor directly under the bed. Its shape and position align with the foot of the bed, extending slightly beyond its edges. The rug contrasts with the lighter beige floor tiles and serves as a focal point beneath the bed, which is a common design choice to anchor the furniture. The rug’s placement and size appear intentional, contributing to the room’s overall aesthetic. Thus, the presence and positioning of the rug match the description.",

      "question": "Is there a window with sheer white curtains visible on the left side of the room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the left side of the room (from the viewer's perspective), there is a window partially covered by sheer white curtains. These curtains allow natural light to filter through while maintaining privacy. The curtain fabric appears lightweight and translucent, consistent with typical sheer drapery used in bedrooms. The window is positioned behind the bed's canopy, suggesting it is a standard feature in the room’s layout. This matches common interior design practices where windows are placed to provide natural light and ventilation.",

      "question": "Are the floor tiles light beige in color and arranged in a square grid pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flooring consists of large, uniformly sized tiles that are light beige in color. These tiles are laid out in a regular square grid pattern, creating a clean and structured appearance. The grout lines between the tiles are straight and evenly spaced, reinforcing the geometric layout. Light beige tiles are commonly used in residential and hospitality interiors for their neutral tone and ease of maintenance. The visual evidence supports the description of both color and pattern.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bedside table on the right side of the bed holds a lamp. The lamp has a decorative, patterned shade with intricate designs, possibly made of fabric or glass with cut-out patterns. The base of the lamp is metallic, likely brass or gold-toned, with ornate detailing. This combination of a patterned shade and metallic base is consistent with traditional or vintage-style lighting fixtures often found in elegantly furnished rooms. The visual details confirm the presence of such a lamp.",
