      "question": "Is the figure in the top-right corner still shown with its right arm raised high, holding a weapon aloft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure in the top-right corner is a plush toy version of a minotaur-like creature. Its right arm is indeed raised high, and it is holding a red axe aloft. This posture matches the original pose seen in Image A, where the same figure had its right arm raised with a weapon. The transformation from plastic to plush material does not alter the pose significantly, preserving the dynamic action stance. Therefore, based on visual analysis and consistency in pose across both images, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Does the figure in the bottom-left corner still show a hand gripping a curved blade in its right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom-left figure is a plush toy resembling a fish-like creature with a blue body and yellow accents. It holds a red curved blade in its right hand, which corresponds to the weapon held by the original figure in Image A. Despite the change in material (plastic to fabric) and color scheme, the positioning of the hand and the shape of the blade remain consistent with the original. Thus, the grip and orientation of the weapon are preserved.",

      "question": "Is the figure in the bottom-left corner still in a kneeling position with one knee on the ground and the other leg bent forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom-left figure appears to be in a crouched or low stance, but not fully kneeling. One knee is touching the ground, and the other leg is bent forward, similar to the original figure in Image A. However, due to the soft nature of the plush material, the posture may appear slightly less rigid than the original. Nevertheless, the overall pose—kneeling with one knee down and the other leg forward—is maintained. This indicates that the essential pose has been preserved despite the material change.",

      "question": "Does the figure in the top-left corner still face slightly to the left with its head turned toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-left figure is a plush toy with a blue body and green accents. It faces slightly to the left, as in the original image, and its head is turned toward the viewer, giving a direct gaze. This is consistent with the original figure’s orientation in Image A. Although the facial features are simplified due to the plush design, the directionality and head turn are preserved. Therefore, the figure maintains the same directional orientation.",

      "question": "Does the figure in the bottom-right corner still hold a long, vertical weapon in its right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom-right figure is a yellow and red plush toy resembling a fish with legs. It holds a long, red vertical weapon in its right hand, which matches the appearance of the weapon in Image A. The weapon is upright and aligned vertically, just like in the original. The change in material does not affect the positioning or orientation of the weapon, so the key detail is retained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the left leg of the top-right figure still bent backward, supporting a forward lunge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-right figure is in a dynamic pose, with its right arm raised and its body leaning forward. The left leg is bent backward, providing balance for the forward lunge, similar to the original figure in Image A. Even though the plush material may soften the angles slightly, the overall posture—left leg extended back while the body lunges forward—is clearly maintained. This suggests that the structural dynamics of the pose have been preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom-right figure is a plush toy with a yellow and red body. Upon close inspection, there is no visible skull-shaped pendant around its neck. In contrast, the original figure in Image A clearly has a skull pendant hanging from its neck. The transformation into a plush toy likely omitted this detail due to simplification or design choice. Therefore, based on visual evidence, the skull pendant is absent in the edited image.",
