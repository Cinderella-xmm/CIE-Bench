      "question": "Is the crisscross lattice pattern of pastry strips visible on the pie's surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie's surface clearly displays a crisscross lattice pattern formed by interwoven pastry strips. This is evident from the grid-like structure of the crust, where alternating strips of dough cross over each other to create square openings. The lattice design is consistent with traditional pie-making techniques and is prominently featured across the top of the pie. Despite the addition of a cartoonish elderly woman and animated pastries in the image, the lattice pattern remains visually intact and distinguishable. This observation aligns with common baking practices where lattice crusts are used for both aesthetic appeal and to allow steam to escape during baking.",

      "question": "Is the knife with a metallic blade and wooden handle clearly present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife that was originally present in Image A has been replaced by a quill pen held by the illustrated elderly woman. While the original knife had a metallic blade and wooden handle, this object is no longer visible in Image B. Instead, the quill pen, which is dark brown with a feathered tip, is being held by the character. This change suggests an artistic or humorous reinterpretation of the scene, possibly referencing 'pie' as a metaphor for silence (e.g., 'a slice of silence'). Therefore, the original knife is not present in Image B.",

      "question": "Is a fine dusting of white powdered sugar visible on the surface of the pie, particularly over the lattice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible dusting of white powdered sugar on the pie's surface. In contrast to Image A, where the pie is lightly dusted with powdered sugar, especially over the lattice, Image B shows the pie without such a coating. The absence of powdered sugar may be intentional, as the added elements (like the elderly woman and animated pastries) suggest a stylized or whimsical presentation rather than a realistic one. Additionally, the presence of the woman and her attire implies a narrative context, which could explain the omission of decorative elements like sugar dusting.",

      "question": "Is the pie crust uniformly golden brown in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie crust appears to have a generally golden brown color, consistent with a well-baked pastry. However, due to the artistic modifications—such as the integration of the elderly woman into the pie’s surface—the crust's appearance is partially obscured. Nonetheless, the visible portions of the crust maintain a uniform golden hue, suggesting proper baking. There are no noticeable burnt or pale areas, indicating even heat exposure during cooking. While some parts of the crust are altered by the illustration, the overall coloration remains consistent with a traditionally baked pie crust.",

      "question": "Are dark red sections of fruit filling visible through the gaps in the lattice crust?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, dark red sections of fruit filling are indeed visible through the gaps in the lattice crust. These gaps, created by the crisscross pattern of the pastry strips, reveal the rich, dark red filling beneath, which is characteristic of fruit-based pies such as cherry or raspberry. Although the pie has been artistically modified with a central figure and surrounding animated pastries, the lattice structure still allows glimpses of the filling. This detail supports the idea that the pie is filled with a fruit compote, consistent with typical pie recipes. The visibility of the filling through the lattice adds depth and realism to the image despite its fantastical elements.",
