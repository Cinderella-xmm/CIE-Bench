      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the blade visibly curved in the same manner as in the original image, extending from the guard to a pointed tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade is clearly curved, following a smooth, crescent-like arc that begins at the guard and tapers toward a rounded tip. This curvature mirrors the general shape of a traditional dagger or jambiya-style blade, which is typically curved. However, upon closer inspection, the tip appears more blunt and rounded compared to the sharp, pointed tip seen in Image A. The curve itself is consistent with the original in direction and flow, but the final point is not as sharply defined. Based on visual cues and common knowledge of such blades, the overall curvature is preserved, though the tip's form differs slightly.",

      "question": "Does the hilt retain the segmented, block-like pattern along its length, similar to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hilt appears to be made of soft, plush material with a uniform, padded texture. There are no visible segments or block-like divisions along its length. In contrast, Image A shows a hilt made of what appears to be bone or ivory, with distinct segmented sections that create a geometric, mosaic-like pattern. The edited version lacks this segmentation entirely, replacing it with a smooth, continuous surface. Therefore, the segmented pattern is absent in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the guard decorated with intricate floral and geometric patterns, matching the original design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guard is made of soft fabric and has a simple, padded appearance without any visible engravings or decorative elements. It lacks the detailed floral and geometric designs seen in Image A, where the guard is metallic and intricately engraved with symmetrical patterns. The edited version simplifies the guard into a plain, cushioned form, sacrificing the ornamental details present in the original. Thus, the guard in Image B does not match the original in terms of decoration.",

      "question": "Is the blade covered with a dense black filigree pattern, matching the original in layout and coverage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade is covered in a silver-gray fabric with black embroidered patterns. While the design includes some stylized motifs resembling the filigree of the original, the density and complexity are significantly reduced. The original blade (Image A) features an elaborate, densely packed black filigree pattern covering nearly the entire surface, with fine, interlocking lines forming a lace-like effect. In contrast, the embroidery in Image B is sparse and less detailed, with only a few scattered patterns. The layout and coverage do not match the originalâ€™s intricate design.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions between the hilt, guard, and blade preserved, with the blade being longer than the hilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the relative proportions between the hilt, guard, and blade appear consistent with the original. The blade extends significantly beyond the hilt, maintaining the typical dagger proportion where the blade is longer than the handle. The guard is positioned correctly between the hilt and blade, and the overall silhouette matches the original in scale and balance. Although materials differ, the structural proportions remain faithful to the original design.",

      "question": "Does the blade end in a pointed tip, consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade ends in a small, rounded tip rather than a sharp point. While the general shape of the blade is curved and elongated like in the original, the tip is blunted and soft, likely due to the plush material used. In contrast, Image A shows a sharp, tapered tip, characteristic of a functional or ceremonial blade. The difference in material (soft fabric vs. metal) results in a loss of the pointed tip in the edited version. Therefore, the tip is not consistent with the original.",

      "question": "Is the dagger positioned diagonally across the frame, from upper left to lower right, as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dagger is placed diagonally, starting from the upper left corner and extending toward the lower right, just as in Image A. The orientation and angle are nearly identical, suggesting that the positioning was intentionally preserved during editing. The alignment follows the same diagonal trajectory, ensuring visual continuity between the two images despite differences in material and detail. This consistency in framing supports the conclusion that the positioning is preserved.",
