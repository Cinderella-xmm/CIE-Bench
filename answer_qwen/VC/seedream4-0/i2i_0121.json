      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is clearly wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat. The hat has a distinct red band around its base, which is a signature feature of this character's iconic look. This visual detail aligns with well-known depictions from the anime and manga series 'One Piece,' where the protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy, famously wears such a hat. The red band is not only visible but also matches the color scheme of his coat, reinforcing the authenticity of the design. Based on these visual cues and world knowledge about the character, it is evident that the hat includes a red band.",

      "question": "Is the character wearing a red open-collared coat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted wearing a red coat with an open front, revealing part of his chest and defined abdominal muscles. The coat has yellow buttons down the center and flared sleeves, consistent with the classic design associated with the character. The collar is indeed open, contributing to the casual and adventurous appearance typical of the character. This matches known representations from the 'One Piece' series, where the red coat is a central element of his outfit. Therefore, based on both visual evidence and prior knowledge of the character’s attire, the answer is confirmed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bright yellow fabric is wrapped around the character's waist and drapes down over the front of his shorts. This sash is tied in a manner consistent with how it is traditionally portrayed in the 'One Piece' series—loosely secured and flowing slightly. The color and placement match the iconic yellow sash worn by the character. Even though the style of the image is more stylized (e.g., chibi or toy-like), the presence and positioning of the sash are unmistakable. This detail is a key component of the character’s signature look and is preserved here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is wearing blue shorts that extend to mid-thigh. At the hem of each leg, there is a white, fluffy trim resembling fur, which is a distinctive feature of the character’s outfit. This trim is visible and consistent across both legs, matching the traditional design seen in official artwork and merchandise. While the shorts appear slightly shorter than in some other versions due to the stylized art form, the blue color and furry trim remain intact. This combination is a hallmark of the character’s appearance and is accurately represented here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character displays a joyful facial expression. His eyes are large and round, conveying excitement and happiness, and his mouth is open in a broad smile, showing teeth. These features are characteristic of the character’s energetic and optimistic personality as depicted throughout the 'One Piece' series. The exaggerated, cartoonish style enhances the cheerfulness, making the expression even more pronounced. Compared to standard portrayals, the chibi-style rendering amplifies the cuteness and expressiveness, but the core elements of the cheerful expression—wide eyes and open smile—are fully present and consistent with the character’s usual demeanor.",
