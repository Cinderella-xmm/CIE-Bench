      "question": "Does the edited image retain the alternating tan and dark brown pattern on the turtle's shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turtle's shell is stylized as part of a cartoonish character design. The shell features a pattern that resembles the natural alternating tan and dark brown coloration seen in real turtles, particularly in species like the African spurred tortoise. However, the pattern is simplified and more uniform compared to the intricate, organic patterns in nature. Despite this simplification, the core visual elements—alternating light and dark segments—are preserved, albeit in a more artistic and less realistic manner. This suggests that while the pattern is not perfectly replicated, it is conceptually retained. Based on world knowledge, many stylized animal representations maintain recognizable traits from their real-life counterparts, even when exaggerated or simplified. Therefore, the alternating tan and dark brown pattern is present in a modified form.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the turtle's limb structure, even if the limbs are stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turtle's limbs are elongated and anthropomorphized, with long, thin legs ending in boots, which deviates significantly from the short, sturdy limbs of a real turtle. However, the basic structure of having four limbs is preserved, and the limbs are positioned in a way that reflects the general anatomy of a turtle, albeit exaggerated for stylistic purposes. In real turtles, limbs are used for movement and support, and while the proportions are altered here, the functional representation of limbs remains intact. Stylization often involves exaggeration (e.g., in cartoons), but the underlying anatomical concept of four limbs is maintained. Thus, although the limbs are highly stylized, they still reflect the fundamental limb structure of a turtle.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the textured appearance of the turtle's shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turtle's shell has a smooth, rounded surface with minimal texturing. While it includes a patterned design resembling the scutes of a real turtle, the texture is flat and lacks the depth, ridges, and natural wear seen in real shells. Real turtle shells have a rough, layered texture due to the overlapping scutes and growth lines. In contrast, the shell in Image B appears polished and simplified, typical of a 3D-rendered cartoon character. The lack of fine detail and depth indicates that the textured appearance is not accurately retained. Therefore, despite the presence of a pattern, the tactile and visual texture of a real turtle’s shell is not preserved.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the turtle's head structure, including its visible eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turtle's head is clearly depicted with large, round eyes that are prominent and expressive, consistent with cartoon character design. While the shape of the head is simplified and stylized (more rounded and less angular than a real turtle), the essential features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth are present and positioned correctly relative to each other. Real turtles have small, beady eyes and a distinct snout, but in this stylized version, the eyes are enlarged for emotional expression, a common technique in animation. Nevertheless, the head structure retains the basic components of a turtle’s head, including visible eyes. The presence of these key facial features confirms that the head structure is conceptually preserved, even if exaggerated.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turtle's limbs are depicted with a smooth, rubbery texture, lacking the rough, bumpy skin and scales characteristic of real turtle limbs. Real turtle limbs have a thick, leathery texture with visible scales and wrinkles, especially around the joints and claws. In contrast, the limbs in the edited image are uniformly smooth and featureless, designed to resemble stylized cartoon limbs rather than realistic anatomy. While the limbs are proportionally longer than in reality, their surface lacks any detailed texturing. Therefore, the textured appearance of the turtle's limbs is not retained; instead, they are rendered in a simplified, smooth style suitable for a character design.",
