    "Question": "Q1: Is the detailed texture of the elephant's skin, showing wrinkles and creases, preserved in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's skin exhibits a high level of detail, with visible wrinkles and creases across its body, particularly noticeable on the back, legs, and around the ears. These textures are characteristic of an elephant's thick, tough skin, which naturally develops deep folds due to movement and age. The lighting in the image enhances these features by casting subtle shadows that accentuate the depth of the wrinkles. This level of detail is consistent with real-world observations of elephants, especially young ones whose skin is still developing but already shows pronounced textural patterns. Based on visual analysis and biological knowledge of elephant anatomy, the texture appears accurately represented.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the elephant's posture, including the raised front leg and curved trunk, retained in the image?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the elephant’s left front leg is slightly lifted, indicating motion or balance adjustment, which is typical for a walking or stepping animal. The trunk is curved downward and touching the rock surface, suggesting natural movement or exploration. This posture aligns with how young elephants typically behave—curious and active. Comparing this to Image A (which shows the same elephant in a similar stance), the posture appears nearly identical: the same leg is raised, and the trunk maintains a comparable curvature. The consistency between both images supports the retention of original posture. Therefore, based on anatomical plausibility and visual comparison, the posture is preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the proportions of the elephant's ears and trunk, consistent with its young age, maintained in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's ears are relatively small compared to its head size, which is typical for juvenile elephants. Adult elephants have larger ears relative to their heads, especially African elephants, but Asian elephants—likely the species here—have smaller ears even as adults. However, for a young individual, the ears appear proportionally appropriate. The trunk is slender and not overly long, which matches the developmental stage of a calf. Young elephants have shorter trunks that grow longer with age. Given the overall body size and the relative dimensions of the trunk and ears, they are consistent with those of a young elephant. No distortion or unnatural scaling is evident. Thus, the proportions are biologically plausible and well-maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the elephant positioned on the rock edge, with its legs and trunk maintaining their relative placement to the rock surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant stands on a rocky surface, with all four feet placed firmly on the edge of the rock. The front legs are positioned forward, and the hind legs are slightly behind, indicating stable weight distribution. The trunk extends downward and touches the rock, suggesting interaction with the surface. This positioning is consistent with natural behavior when an elephant steps onto or explores elevated terrain. Compared to Image A, where the elephant is similarly positioned on the same rock formation, the relative placement of legs and trunk remains unchanged. The continuity in spatial relationship between the animal and the rock confirms that the positioning has been preserved accurately in the edited version.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the elephant face towards the right side of the image, preserving its profile orientation?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the elephant in a side profile view, facing toward the right side of the frame. Its head is turned slightly forward, but the main axis of the body runs from left to right, with the trunk extending toward the right. This orientation is consistent with the original image (Image A), where the same profile view is present. There is no indication of rotation or repositioning that would alter the direction it faces. In wildlife photography, maintaining profile orientation is important for accurate representation, and here, the editing process has preserved the original directionality without distortion. Thus, the elephant indeed faces right, maintaining its intended profile.",
    "answer": "Yes"
