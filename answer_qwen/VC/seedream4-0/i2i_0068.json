        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seated person is depicted holding a cake with lit candles. Observing the visual cues, the cake is clearly in the person's left hand, resting on a plate. The right hand is positioned lower and appears to be relaxed or slightly away from the cake, not supporting it. This suggests that only one hand is actively holding the cake. While the artistic style of the image (resembling an oil painting) softens edges and details, the positioning of the hands is distinguishable enough to infer that both hands are not involved in holding the cake. In real-world contexts, holding a cake with both hands would typically involve a more balanced grip, especially when lighting is present, but here the posture does not support that. Therefore, based on visual analysis and common sense about object handling, the seated person is not holding the cake with both hands.",

      "question": "Is the standing person still in the act of throwing a gray object over the seated person's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing person has their arm raised high, and a gray object (which resembles a hat or scarf) is positioned above the seated person’s head. The motion and angle suggest an action in progress—specifically, the moment just before or during the placement of the object. The object appears to be mid-air, indicating dynamic movement. Given the context of a celebration (evidenced by the cake with lit candles), this gesture likely symbolizes a playful surprise, such as placing a party hat. The artistic rendering enhances the sense of motion through brushstrokes and positioning. In real-world scenarios, such actions are often captured mid-motion in celebratory photos. Thus, the visual evidence supports that the standing person is indeed in the act of throwing or placing the gray object over the seated person's head.",

      "question": "Are the candles on the cake still lit in a soft glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the candles on the cake are visibly glowing, with light emanating from their tips. The depiction uses warm tones around the flames, consistent with how light from candles is rendered in paintings or stylized images. Even though the image has a painterly effect, the contrast between the dark background and the bright flame areas indicates illumination. The 'soft glow' is implied by the diffused lighting around the candles, which is typical in artistic representations of candlelight. In reality, candlelight produces a gentle, warm radiance, and the image captures this quality through color gradients and highlights. Therefore, despite the stylization, the candles appear to be lit and emitting a soft glow.",

      "question": "Is the refrigerator with drinks still visible in the background behind the seated person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the refrigerator is clearly visible on the left side of the frame, positioned behind the seated person. It contains multiple shelves stocked with various bottles and containers, consistent with a beverage cooler in a café setting. The structure and contents are recognizable despite the artistic interpretation, which uses broad brushstrokes but maintains key features like the glass door, shelving, and product arrangement. In real-world cafés, refrigerators are commonly placed near seating areas for customer access, and their presence here aligns with typical layout logic. The continuity of this element across the two images confirms its visibility. Thus, the refrigerator remains a prominent feature in the background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a café environment with a warm color palette dominated by yellows, oranges, and soft pinks, particularly in the background and ambient areas. The lighting appears to originate from overhead fixtures and possibly wall-mounted lights, casting a consistent glow throughout the space. Although the artistic style exaggerates certain elements, the overall luminosity is uniform, without harsh shadows or stark contrasts. Warm lighting is typical in cafés to create a cozy, inviting atmosphere, and this image reflects that design principle. The even distribution is suggested by the lack of dark patches and the balanced illumination of both foreground and background elements. Therefore, the lighting remains warm and evenly spread across the scene.",
