    "Question": "Q1: Is the left front leg of the horse raised off the ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is depicted in a dynamic pose with one of its front legs lifted. Observing the positioning of the limbs, the left front leg is clearly raised and bent at the knee, indicating it is off the ground. This posture is typical of a prancing or walking motion in equine sculptures. The elevated position of the leg is consistent with the artistic representation of movement in ancient Chinese pottery, particularly Tang dynasty tomb figures, which often depict horses in mid-stride. The visual evidence supports that the left front leg is indeed raised.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the mane flow downward along the neck in long, wavy strands?",
    "explanation": "The mane of the horse in Image B appears to be sculpted in a way that suggests flowing movement. It extends from the top of the head down the neck and is shaped into long, undulating strands that mimic natural hair flow. These strands are not stiff or flat but have a wavy texture, consistent with artistic depictions of manes in Tang dynasty ceramics. The direction and form of the mane align with the forward motion of the horse, enhancing the sense of dynamism. Based on visual cues and historical art style, the mane does flow downward in long, wavy strands.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the tail positioned over the left side of the rear flank?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the horse is visible and appears to be draped over the left side of the rear flank. It curves outward and downward, resting against the body’s left side. This positioning is common in stylized representations of horses in ancient Chinese art, where the tail is often shown in a relaxed or slightly swinging posture. The tail’s placement relative to the horse's body confirms it is on the left side, not the right or central axis. Therefore, based on the visual orientation and anatomical consistency, the tail is indeed positioned over the left side of the rear flank.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are there pleated folds and spherical ornaments on the saddle cloth?",
    "explanation": "The saddle cloth in Image B displays distinct vertical pleats, especially noticeable on the side facing the viewer. These folds are sculpted to resemble fabric draping, adding texture and realism to the piece. Additionally, there are small, rounded, spherical elements attached to the saddle cloth, likely representing decorative tassels or ornaments. These features are consistent with Tang dynasty horse figurines, which often included ornate saddle decorations. The presence of both pleated folds and spherical embellishments is evident in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there visible traces of red-orange pigment on the saddle and bridle?",
    "explanation": "The saddle and bridle areas of the horse in Image B show clear remnants of red-orange pigment. These pigments are concentrated on the edges of the saddle cloth, the straps, and parts of the bridle, indicating original painted decoration. Such coloring is typical of polychrome terracotta figures from the Tang dynasty, where reds and oranges were commonly used for adornment. The pigment appears faded but still identifiable, suggesting intentional application during creation. Thus, the presence of red-orange pigment is visually confirmed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the horse’s ears stand upright and pointed?",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the horse’s head in Image B, the ears are positioned vertically and appear to be pointed upward. This posture is characteristic of alertness in equine anatomy and is commonly seen in Tang dynasty horse figurines to convey vitality and attention. The shape of the ears is elongated and sharply defined, further supporting the description of them being upright and pointed. There is no indication of drooping or backward tilt, so the ears are indeed standing upright.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are three hooves in contact with the base and one lifted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is posed such that three of its hooves are touching the base: the right front hoof, the left hind hoof, and the right hind hoof. The left front hoof is raised and not in contact with the base. This configuration is consistent with a prancing or walking gait, where one leg is lifted mid-motion. The base supports the weight of the sculpture through these three points of contact, while the fourth (left front) is elevated. This matches the typical stance seen in many ancient Chinese ceramic horse statues.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the surface of the horse showing signs of chipping and aging?",
    "explanation": "The surface of the horse in Image B exhibits visible signs of wear, including minor chipping, discoloration, and surface erosion, particularly around the edges and extremities like the hooves and mane. These imperfections are consistent with aged terracotta artifacts that have undergone time-related degradation. The uneven texture and color variations suggest exposure to environmental factors or handling over centuries. Such characteristics are typical of authentic ancient Chinese burial figures, reinforcing the conclusion that the surface shows signs of chipping and aging.",
    "answer": "Yes"
