      "question": "Is the woman wearing round gold-rimmed spectacles on her nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is clearly depicted wearing round spectacles with a golden or bronze-colored rim. The glasses are positioned on her nose and rest over her eyes, consistent with typical eyewear design. The frame appears to be metallic and circular, matching the description of 'round gold-rimmed spectacles.' This observation aligns with common visual representations of traditional or vintage-style eyeglasses, especially those worn by elderly individuals in artistic illustrations. The coloration and shape are distinct enough to confirm the presence of such spectacles.",

      "question": "Does the woman have silver hair styled in a high bun on top of her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B has grayish-silver hair that is neatly gathered into a high bun at the top of her head. The style is traditional and well-structured, resembling a classic updo often seen in depictions of elderly women in cultural or familial settings. The hair texture and coloration suggest age, and the bun is elevated and tightly arranged, indicating intentional styling. This matches the description of a high bun made from silver hair.",

      "question": "Are the woman’s hands positioned in a way that shows her actively knitting with needles and yarn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hands are shown holding two knitting needles, with yarn wrapped around them and partially forming a knitted fabric. Her fingers are positioned in a manner consistent with active knitting—specifically, one hand holds the needle with the work in progress while the other manipulates the yarn and needle to form stitches. This posture is typical of someone engaged in knitting, suggesting she is mid-process. The visible tension in the yarn and the placement of the needles further support this interpretation.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the small wooden table beside the woman in Image B, several balls of yarn are visible. These include different colors such as pink, green, white, and yellow, all neatly wound into spherical shapes. Their arrangement suggests they are ready for use in knitting. This detail is common in scenes depicting craft activities, where multiple yarns are used for multicolored projects. The presence of these balls confirms the availability of materials for knitting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Behind the woman in Image B, there is a window composed of multiple rectangular panes, which appear to be white or light-colored. The window allows soft, diffused light to enter the room, illuminating the scene and casting gentle shadows. The structure of the window, including its framing and division into panes, is consistent with traditional interior design elements. The lighting suggests daylight coming through, reinforcing the idea of natural illumination.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B is wearing layered clothing. Beneath her outer garment, a dark teal-colored robe is visible, particularly along the neckline and under the sleeves. A white collar is also noticeable, peeking out from underneath the outer layer. This combination of colors and design elements is typical of traditional East Asian attire, such as a kimono or hanbok-inspired outfit. The contrast between the dark teal and the white collar is clear and deliberate in the illustration.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible green leafy plants hanging from the top corners of the frame. While there is a plant visible on the left side of the image (on a table), it is not hanging from the frame itself. Additionally, the top corners of the image are framed with a vintage-style border, but no foliage extends from those areas. Therefore, based on visual evidence, the claim about hanging plants in the corners is not supported.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B is seated on a wooden chair. The backrest of the chair features ornate carvings, including rounded vertical spindles and decorative patterns typical of traditional furniture design. The wood appears dark and polished, and the overall structure suggests a classic or antique style. The carved details are clearly visible, confirming that the chair has a carved backrest.",
