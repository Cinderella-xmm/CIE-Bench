      "question": "Is the painting still depicting orange-yellow trees along a river under a setting sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting on the wall shows a scene with trees displaying vibrant orange and yellow foliage, consistent with autumn colors. These trees are positioned along both sides of a calm river that reflects the warm hues of the sky. The sun is visible near the horizon, casting a golden glow across the water and sky, indicating a sunset. This visual information aligns with the description of a landscape featuring orange-yellow trees by a river during sunset. The composition and color palette are coherent with typical representations of such scenes in art, confirming that the core elements remain intact.",

      "question": "Does the sofa still have beige cushions with a yellow accent pillow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the sofa features multiple cushions. The main back cushions and seat cushions are in a neutral beige tone, matching the overall minimalist aesthetic of the room. Among these, there is one smaller pillow that stands out due to its deeper yellow or mustard hue, which serves as an accent piece. This arrangement matches the description of beige cushions with a yellow accent pillow. The placement and color contrast confirm this detail remains unchanged from typical interior design choices for warmth and visual interest.",

      "question": "Is the sofa still positioned directly below the wall painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa is centered beneath the framed painting on the wall. The alignment appears symmetrical, with the center of the sofa directly under the center of the artwork. This positioning is common in interior design to create balance and harmony in a living space. There is no visible shift in the sofa's location relative to the painting, and the proportions suggest intentional placement. Comparing this to typical furniture layout principles, the sofaâ€™s position relative to the artwork has not changed.",

      "question": "Is the room still illuminated by natural light coming from the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows distinct shadows cast diagonally across the floor and wall from the right side of the frame, indicating a light source entering from that direction. The pattern of light and shadow suggests sunlight streaming through a window or opening on the right, creating soft highlights on the sofa and the wall. This lighting behavior is consistent with natural daylight coming from the right side. The angle and clarity of the shadows support this conclusion, as artificial lighting typically produces less directional or more diffused patterns.",

      "question": "Is the floor still covered with a light herringbone-patterned material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flooring in Image B displays a distinct herringbone pattern composed of light-colored wooden planks arranged in a V-shaped interlocking design. This pattern is clearly visible across the entire floor area shown. The material appears to be wood or a wood-like composite, and its light tone contributes to the bright, airy feel of the room. This matches the description of a light herringbone-patterned floor. The consistency of the pattern and material is evident throughout, confirming it remains unchanged.",
