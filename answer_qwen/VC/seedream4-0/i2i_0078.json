      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wristwatch retains a black bezel with white markings and a silver-toned case and bracelet. The color scheme of black and silver is consistent with typical dive watch designs, which often use these colors for contrast and durability. The visual cues show no deviation from this color palette—there are no signs of additional colors or material changes. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and common design principles of such watches, the watch’s design remains black and silver.",

      "question": "Does the watch still have a white face with black hour markers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dial of the watch in Image B is clearly white, with black rectangular hour markers at each hour position. This is consistent with standard watch design where high-contrast elements improve readability. There are no visible alterations to the face color or marker style, and the layout matches typical analog timepieces. Thus, based on visual inspection and common watch aesthetics, the watch maintains its white face with black hour markers.",

      "question": "Is the watch still equipped with a metallic bracelet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bracelet of the watch in Image B is composed of interlinked polished metal segments, characteristic of a stainless steel or similar alloy bracelet commonly found on luxury or sporty wristwatches. The reflective surface and structural design confirm it is metallic. There is no indication of a change to a fabric, rubber, or leather strap. Hence, based on visual features and typical watch construction, the watch retains a metallic bracelet.",

      "question": "Is the wristwatch still placed on the same white surface in its original position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The watch in Image B is placed on a white surface that appears to be a drawer or cabinet top, matching the one in Image A. However, the background has changed significantly—from a modern bedroom setting to an old-fashioned train interior. Despite the identical placement of the watch on the white surface, the surrounding environment suggests a digital edit where the background was replaced while keeping the watch and surface unchanged. Therefore, while the watch is on the same type of surface and in a similar orientation, the context implies a repositioning in a virtual space rather than physical continuity. Thus, although the surface is the same, the overall scene is not. Based on reasoning about image editing techniques and environmental context, the watch is not in its original physical location.",

      "question": "Are the original lighting and shadows of the watch preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears warmer and more directional compared to Image A, which had softer, natural daylight coming from a window. The shadows cast by the watch in Image B are sharper and more defined, consistent with overhead artificial lighting seen in the train carriage. In contrast, Image A shows diffuse lighting with softer shadows due to ambient daylight. This difference indicates that the lighting conditions were altered during editing to match the new environment. Therefore, the original lighting and shadow characteristics are not preserved.",
