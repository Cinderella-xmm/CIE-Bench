      "question": "Does the woman in the image have a clear, noticeable smile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's facial expression is clearly depicted with an open mouth showing teeth, and her eyes are slightly crinkled at the corners, which are typical indicators of a genuine smile. The artistic style of the image, resembling a soft watercolor or digital illustration, enhances the warmth of her expression. Even though the rendering is stylized, the key features of a smile—such as upward-curving lips and relaxed facial muscles—are preserved and clearly visible. This aligns with common visual cues used to interpret smiling in both real-life and illustrated contexts.",

      "question": "Are there exactly three teddy bears, each with a distinct red shirt containing a blessing text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, three teddy bears are visibly held by the woman. Each bear wears a red shirt with white text that appears to be a message or blessing. The text on each shirt is different: one reads 'thinking of you makes me smile,' another says 'BEST FRIENDS REVIVAL,' and the third states 'COULD YOU USE A HUG TODAY?' These messages are legible and distinct, indicating individualized sentiments. The presence of three bears and unique texts on their shirts confirms the description. This matches typical marketing practices for themed plush toys, where each item carries a personalized message.",

      "question": "Are the teddy bears positioned in front of the woman as she holds them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three teddy bears are placed directly in front of the woman’s torso, held securely in her arms. Their positioning is central and forward-facing, aligned with the viewer’s perspective. This arrangement suggests they are being presented as part of the scene, likely emphasizing their importance. In both real-life photography and illustrative art, objects held close to the body and facing outward are typically interpreted as being positioned in front of the subject. The composition reinforces this spatial relationship.",

      "question": "Is the woman wearing a checkered black-and-white jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is wearing a jacket with a visible pattern of alternating dark and light squares, consistent with a checkered design. The colors appear to be black and white, based on the contrast and shading in the illustration. While the artistic style softens the edges, the pattern remains recognizable as plaid or checkered. This type of clothing is common in casual wear and is often associated with comfort and informality. The depiction in the image supports the identification of the jacket as checkered and black-and-white.",

      "question": "Is the background kept simple with minimal distractions (beige wall and striped blanket)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a plain, light beige wall and a sofa with subtle texture, possibly tufted. There is no visible striped blanket; instead, the couch appears to be uniformly colored with soft shading. The overall composition avoids clutter, focusing attention on the woman and the teddy bears. While the original image (Image A) may have shown a striped blanket, Image B has been artistically rendered to simplify the background, removing such details. Therefore, the background is indeed minimalistic and distraction-free, but it does not include a striped blanket as described. The absence of stripes contradicts the specific detail mentioned in the question.",
