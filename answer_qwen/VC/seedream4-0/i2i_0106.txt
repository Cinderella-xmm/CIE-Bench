    "Question": "Q1: Is the suit primarily colored red and gold?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the figurine is clearly depicted wearing a suit that features dominant red and gold colors. The red sections cover most of the torso, arms, and legs, while gold accents are present on the shoulders, chest, and joints. This color scheme is consistent with the iconic Iron Man armor design from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The visual cues confirm that the primary colors of the suit are indeed red and gold, which aligns with common knowledge about Iron Man's appearance in various media.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the arc reactor illuminated and located at the center of the chest?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central part of the figurine's chest displays a circular blue light, which is characteristic of the arc reactor—a key component of Iron Man's suit. The reactor is positioned directly in the center of the chest, as it typically is in Iron Man designs. The illumination is visible, indicating that the reactor is active. This matches both the visual representation and the established lore where the arc reactor powers the suit and keeps the character alive.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the figurine maintain the character's beard and spiky hairstyle?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized figurine with a short, spiky brown hairstyle and a well-defined beard, consistent with Tony Stark's appearance in the later films (e.g., Avengers: Endgame). Although the style is chibi or cartoonish, the facial features—including the beard and hair—are recognizable and accurately represent the character's signature look. This is supported by world knowledge of Iron Man's portrayal in popular culture, where he often has a beard and tousled hair.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there blue lights present on the right shoulder?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the right shoulder of the figurine does not display any blue lights. Instead, the lighting effects are focused on the arc reactor in the chest and the repulsor on the right hand. The shoulder area appears to be solid red and gold without any visible glowing elements. This contrasts with some versions of Iron Man’s armor that feature additional lights, but in this specific figurine, no blue lights are present on the shoulder.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the base labeled 'I AM IRONMAN'?",

This phrase is famously associated with Iron Man and is a well-known quote from the character. The label is legible and matches the font and style commonly used in official merchandise. This detail confirms that the base is indeed labeled with the specified phrase.",
