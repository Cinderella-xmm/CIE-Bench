    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image contain exactly six labeled process stages corresponding to the CRISP-DM phases?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we observe six distinct animal characters, each standing on a stone with a label beneath them. The labels are: 'Business Understanding', 'Data Understanding', 'Preparation', 'Modeling', 'Evaluation', and 'Deployment'. These correspond directly to the six phases of the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. Each stage is clearly labeled and visually separated, indicating that all six phases are present. Although 'Data Understanding' is labeled as 'Understanding' in one instance and 'Business Understanding' is split into two separate labels ('Business' and 'Understanding'), this appears to be a stylistic or layout choice rather than an omission. However, upon closer inspection, 'Business Understanding' is indeed represented as a single stage by the owl character, even though it's split across two stones. Thus, there are six labeled stages, each representing one phase of CRISP-DM. Therefore, the answer is Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the six stages arranged in the correct sequential order: Business Understanding → Data Understanding → Data Preparation → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment → back to Business Understanding?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the flow of the diagram is indicated by arrows connecting the stages in a circular path. Starting from the top-left, we see 'Business Understanding' (owl), followed by 'Data Understanding' (another owl), then 'Preparation' (cat), 'Modeling' (fox), 'Evaluation' (deer), and 'Deployment' (raccoon). Arrows show a clockwise progression from one stage to the next, ending with an arrow pointing back from 'Deployment' to 'Business Understanding', completing the cycle. This matches the standard CRISP-DM sequence: Business Understanding → Data Understanding → Data Preparation → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment → back to Business Understanding. The visual arrangement and directional arrows confirm the correct order. Therefore, the answer is Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a bidirectional connection (e.g., two-way path or mutual interaction) between the 'Business Understanding' and 'Data Understanding' stages?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the connection between 'Business Understanding' and 'Data Understanding' is shown with a single arrow pointing from 'Business Understanding' to 'Data Understanding'. There is no visible reverse arrow or any indication of a two-way interaction between these two stages. In contrast, other stages like 'Data Preparation' and 'Modeling' have a double-headed arrow, indicating bidirectional interaction. Since only a unidirectional arrow exists between 'Business Understanding' and 'Data Understanding', there is no bidirectional connection. Therefore, the answer is No.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a bidirectional connection (e.g., two-way path or mutual interaction) between the 'Data Preparation' and 'Modeling' stages?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Data Preparation' stage (represented by the cat) and the 'Modeling' stage (represented by the fox) are connected by a double-headed arrow, which clearly indicates a bidirectional relationship. This means that data preparation can influence modeling, and modeling outcomes may require adjustments in data preparation, reflecting iterative feedback common in data science workflows. This is consistent with real-world practices where data cleaning and feature engineering are often refined based on model performance. Therefore, the presence of a double-headed arrow confirms a bidirectional connection. Hence, the answer is Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a central data source located at the center of the diagram, accessible to all six stages?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, at the center of the diagram, there is a glowing chest filled with acorns and crystals, labeled implicitly as 'data' through its placement and symbolic representation. It is positioned equidistant from all six stages, with paths leading toward it from each stage. This central object serves as a metaphorical data repository, accessible to all animals (representing stages). The design suggests that all stages interact with this central data source, reinforcing the idea of shared access. While not explicitly labeled 'Data', its central position and symbolic content (acorns, crystals) align with the concept of a central data asset. Therefore, yes, there is a central data source accessible to all stages. Hence, the answer is Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the diagram include a clear return path from the 'Deployment' stage back to the 'Business Understanding' stage, completing the cycle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Deployment' stage (raccoon with laptop) has an arrow pointing directly back to the 'Business Understanding' stage (owl with glasses), forming a complete loop. This arrow completes the circular flow, indicating that after deployment, the process returns to business understanding—possibly to assess impact, gather new requirements, or initiate another iteration. This reflects the iterative nature of data mining projects. The return path is clearly visible and logically connects the final stage back to the beginning, thus completing the cycle. Therefore, the answer is Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
