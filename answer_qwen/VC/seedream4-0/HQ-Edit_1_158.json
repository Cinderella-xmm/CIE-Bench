      "question": "Is the woman’s silver hair clearly visible and styled in a short, neat manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is rendered in a paper-cutout style, where facial features and hair are abstracted. The head is a smooth, featureless beige silhouette with no indication of hair texture, color, or style. Since there is no visual detail to suggest silver hair or any specific hairstyle, it cannot be determined that the hair is visible or styled in a short, neat manner. This contrasts with typical representations of hair in realistic images, where texture and color are clearly defined. In this artistic medium, such details are intentionally omitted.",

      "question": "Are both hands visibly holding the open book, with fingers wrapped around the edges of the pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are depicted as simplified shapes made of paper, with minimal detail. While they appear to be positioned near the book, the fingers are not clearly defined or wrapped around the edges of the pages. The representation is stylized and lacks anatomical precision. In contrast, in Image A, the hands are realistically detailed, showing fingers gripping the book. However, since the question pertains only to Image B, we assess its own visual cues: the hands are present but lack fine detail, so the exact positioning of fingers cannot be confirmed. Thus, the depiction does not meet the criteria of 'visibly holding' with fingers wrapped around the edges.",

      "question": "Is there a tabby cat sitting on the red rug in the lower-right corner, facing upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is represented as a flat, cut-out silhouette with minimal detailing. It has pointed ears, whiskers, and an upright posture, consistent with a seated cat. The cat is located in the lower-right corner of the image. However, the rug beneath it is not red—it appears to be a solid beige background, matching the overall paper aesthetic. Additionally, the cat's face is facing forward rather than upward. Therefore, while the cat is present and positioned correctly, the description of it being on a red rug and facing upward is inaccurate based on the visual evidence in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the armchair have a high backrest, padded arms, and visible wooden legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armchair is crafted from layered paper, with a tall backrest and wide, curved arms that resemble padding. The structure includes vertical lines at the base that mimic wooden legs. Although these are stylized representations, the form suggests a high backrest and padded arms. The legs are clearly delineated as separate elements, consistent with wooden supports. This matches the general design of a traditional armchair. Even though the materials are symbolic (paper), the visual cues align with the described features. Comparing to Image A, the chair is more realistically rendered, but the structural elements are preserved in Image B. Thus, the answer is supported by the visual design and common understanding of furniture forms.",

      "question": "Is there a stack of five books on the floor to the left of the chair, with a white mug resting on top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a stack of books to the left of the chair, constructed from layered paper. Counting them reveals five distinct rectangular shapes, consistent with books. On top of the stack is a small cup-shaped object, resembling a mug. The entire composition is monochromatic and stylized, but the arrangement matches the description: five books stacked vertically with a mug on top. The color is not white due to the paper medium, but the shape is clearly intended to represent a mug. Based on the visual representation and common sense about how such objects are arranged, the description holds true within the context of the artwork.",

      "question": "Is there a white mug on the small wooden side table to the right of the woman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small table is visible to the right of the woman, made of paper with a simple round top and leg. On this table, there is a cup-shaped object, consistent in form with a mug. However, due to the monochromatic nature of the paper art, the mug is not white—it is beige, matching the paper material. The original image (Image A) shows a white mug, but in Image B, color is not preserved. The presence of the mug is accurate in shape and position, but the color differs. Since the question specifies 'white,' and the mug in Image B is not white, the answer must reflect that discrepancy. Therefore, despite correct placement and form, the color mismatch invalidates the statement.",

      "question": "Is there a beige knitted blanket with lace-like patterns draped over the woman’s lap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blanket is made from intricately cut paper, featuring numerous holes and geometric patterns that resemble lace or knitting. The texture is highly detailed and visually mimics a knitted fabric with openwork designs. The blanket is draped over the woman’s lap, extending to the floor. While it is not actual fabric, the artistic representation strongly suggests a knitted blanket with lace-like patterns. The color is beige, consistent with the paper used. This interpretation aligns with the intent of the artwork, which uses paper to simulate textile textures. Thus, even though it's not real fabric, the visual cues support the description.",

      "question": "Is the woman seated upright with a slight forward lean, facing the viewer while reading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is seated in the armchair with the torso angled slightly forward, suggesting a leaning posture. The body orientation faces directly toward the viewer, and the book is held in front, indicating engagement in reading. Despite the absence of facial features, the posture conveys a forward lean typical of someone absorbed in reading. The alignment of the arms and legs supports this interpretation. Compared to Image A, where the woman is clearly smiling and looking down at the book, Image B maintains the same pose but without facial expression. The forward lean and frontal orientation are preserved, making the description accurate within the context of the stylized representation.",
