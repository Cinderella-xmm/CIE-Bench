      "question": "Is the woman depicted in an upright standing posture with her arms gently extended outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is shown standing straight, facing forward, with her body aligned vertically. Her arms are positioned slightly away from her body, bent at the elbows, and her hands are open with fingers gently curved, suggesting a relaxed yet deliberate gesture. This posture is consistent with a gentle outward extension of the arms. The stance appears balanced and composed, typical of stylized depictions in traditional or animated art forms where poise and elegance are emphasized. Based on visual cues such as symmetry, alignment, and hand positioning, it is clear that she is in an upright standing posture with arms gently extended outward.",

      "question": "Does the woman wear a dress with a V-neckline and wide, flowing sleeves characteristic of traditional Hanfu?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B features a high collar that opens into a V-shaped neckline, which is a common design element in traditional Hanfu garments. The sleeves are notably wide and flow outward, extending beyond the hands, which is a hallmark of Hanfu style, especially in ceremonial or elegant attire. These characteristics—V-neckline and broad, sweeping sleeves—are consistent with historical Hanfu designs, particularly those worn by women in classical Chinese settings. The overall silhouette and fabric drape further support this identification.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the dress displays intricate embroidery along the front panel and sleeves. The floral motifs include soft pink blossoms arranged along dark green vines, forming a vertical pattern down the center of the garment and extending onto the sleeves. These elements are clearly visible and rendered in a detailed, decorative style typical of traditional Chinese textile art. The combination of pink flowers and green vines aligns with common botanical themes in Hanfu embroidery, often symbolizing nature and harmony.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B wears a broad, light-colored waist sash that wraps around her midsection. From the front of the sash, two long, thin strands hang downward, resembling tassels or ribbons. These are commonly seen in Hanfu designs, serving both functional and decorative purposes. The presence of these hanging elements confirms the inclusion of tassels, which are often used to enhance the aesthetic appeal and indicate formality in traditional attire.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a background filled with numerous tall, slender bamboo stalks standing upright and closely spaced, creating a tunnel-like or corridor effect. The stalks are uniformly aligned and extend vertically from the ground to above the frame, framing the woman on both sides. This arrangement mimics a natural bamboo grove pathway, a common motif in East Asian art and literature symbolizing purity and resilience. The perspective enhances the sense of depth, reinforcing the corridor-like structure.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B has long, straight black hair that falls down past her shoulders. A distinct central parting is visible, dividing the hair evenly into two symmetrical sections. This hairstyle is typical in traditional Chinese aesthetics and is often associated with elegance and simplicity. The smooth texture and uniform color of the hair further support the description of long, black, centrally parted hair.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground beneath the woman's feet appears to be covered with a textured surface resembling dry straw or mulch, giving it a natural, earthy appearance. Along the edges of the path, there are visible horizontal lines and patterns consistent with woven bamboo mats or similar materials. These mats are commonly used in traditional settings for pathways or flooring in gardens and pavilions. The combination of straw-like ground cover and structured matting along the sides supports the description of a rustic, natural environment.",
