      "question": "Is the beige sofa present with its original cushion arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beige sofa is clearly visible and positioned centrally in the room. The cushions on the sofa consist of two larger back cushions and four throw pillows—two on each side. On the left side, there is a dark gray pillow next to a cream-colored one, and on the right side, there are two cream-colored pillows. This arrangement appears consistent with typical interior design practices where symmetry and balance are emphasized. There is no visual indication that the cushions have been rearranged or removed. Comparing this to common furniture setup patterns, the current arrangement seems deliberate and intact. Therefore, based on visual cues and standard aesthetic preferences, the cushion arrangement appears unchanged.",

      "question": "Does the painting above the sofa retain its mountain silhouettes and tree outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The painting above the sofa in Image B depicts a landscape scene with prominent mountain silhouettes and tall pine trees against a sunset sky. The mountains are layered in depth, creating a sense of perspective, and the dark tree outlines are clearly defined along the lower edges of the composition. These elements are characteristic of stylized nature art often used in modern interiors. There is no distortion, blurring, or alteration visible in the painting's features. Even though the lighting may slightly affect perception, the core elements—mountains and trees—are intact and recognizable. Thus, based on visual analysis and understanding of artistic representation, the painting retains its original key features.",

      "question": "Is the potted plant with long green leaves present to the right of the sofa?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To the right of the sofa in Image B, there is a large potted plant with long, broad green leaves extending upward and outward. This type of foliage is commonly associated with tropical plants such as a fiddle-leaf fig or bird of paradise. Its placement near the wall and beside the wooden paneling is typical for indoor decor to add natural elements to a space. The plant is fully visible and appears healthy and well-maintained. There is no indication it has been moved or replaced. Based on visual evidence and common interior design practices, the plant remains present in its original position.",

      "question": "Is the woven rug still positioned under the sofa?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Underneath the sofa in Image B, a textured woven rug is clearly visible. It extends across the floor beneath both ends of the sofa and appears to be made of natural fibers like jute or sisal, which are commonly used in minimalist or earthy-themed interiors. The rug’s pattern and color match the neutral tones of the room, contributing to a cohesive design. There is no sign of displacement or removal; it is fully aligned with the sofa’s base. Given the consistency in layout and typical use of area rugs in living rooms, the rug remains in place as intended.",

      "question": "Is the wood-paneled section of the wall visible next to the potted plant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the right side of the image, adjacent to the potted plant, there is a vertical section of wall with horizontal wood paneling. This feature adds warmth and texture to the room and contrasts with the plain white wall behind the sofa. The paneling is consistent in color and spacing, suggesting intentional architectural detailing. Since the plant is placed directly in front of this section, and the paneling is still visible behind it, it confirms that this element remains in view. This aligns with common design choices where accent walls are used to enhance spatial interest. Therefore, based on visual confirmation and design context, the wood-paneled section is indeed visible.",
