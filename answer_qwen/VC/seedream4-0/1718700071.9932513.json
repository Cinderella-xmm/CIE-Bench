      "question": "Does the edited image retain the original facial structure, including the eyes, nose, mouth, and full beard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's face is rendered in a monochromatic, marble-like sculptural style. The facial features—eyes, nose, mouth, and beard—are clearly defined and anatomically consistent with the original depiction in Image A. The eyes are closed, which is a notable difference from Image A where they are open, but this does not alter the fundamental structure of the face. The nose remains prominent and well-proportioned, the mouth retains its shape and position, and the beard is present with detailed curls that match the original form, albeit stylized to fit the sculptural aesthetic. This suggests that while the expression has changed (closed eyes), the underlying facial structure has been preserved. Based on world knowledge of classical sculpture, such changes in eye state are common in statues and do not imply structural alteration. Therefore, the facial structure, including key features, is retained.",

      "question": "Is the subject depicted in the same seated pose with hands resting palms-up on the thighs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is shown in a seated position with both arms bent at the elbows and hands placed on the thighs. The palms are facing upward, consistent with a meditative or serene posture. Comparing this to Image A, the pose appears identical in terms of body alignment, arm positioning, and hand orientation. In both images, the subject’s posture conveys stillness and dignity, typical of regal or divine figures in art. The sculptural rendering in Image B emphasizes volume and form, but does not distort the overall pose. Thus, despite the stylistic shift from painted to carved appearance, the seated posture with palms-up hands is preserved.",

      "question": "Is the headdress present in the same shape and position on the head, with the central diamond motif clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The headdress in Image B is highly detailed and matches the ornate, curly design seen in Image A. It sits atop the head in the same position, framing the face symmetrically. The central diamond-shaped motif, which is a key decorative element, is clearly visible and intricately carved into the sculpture. While the texture and material have changed due to the marble effect, the overall shape and placement remain faithful to the original. Classical sculptures often preserve symbolic elements like central motifs for visual and cultural significance. Here, the consistency in design indicates intentional preservation of the headdress’s form and symbolic center.",

      "question": "Are the earrings still present, dangling from the ears in the same position and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the earrings are visible as elongated, looped structures hanging from the earlobes, consistent with their appearance in Image A. They maintain the same relative position and general form—curved and adorned with tassels or filigree details—though rendered in stone. The sculptural medium affects surface detail, but the earrings’ presence, placement, and basic shape are preserved. In classical statuary, jewelry is often included to denote status or divinity, and here, their inclusion suggests continuity in symbolic representation. There is no indication of omission or significant deformation.",

      "question": "Is the draped garment still present around the lower body, maintaining its original silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower body in Image B shows a fabric-like draping across the lap and legs, consistent with the garment seen in Image A. The folds and flow of the material are rendered in a way that preserves the original silhouette—soft, layered, and centered. Although the texture now mimics marble rather than cloth, the overall shape and placement remain unchanged. Sculptures frequently depict garments with realistic drapery to convey movement and elegance, and this example maintains that tradition. The garment’s continuity supports the idea that it was intentionally preserved during the edit.",

      "question": "Are the defined abdominal muscles, pectorals, and arm musculature still clearly visible and proportionally accurate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the musculature is highly detailed and anatomically precise. The abdominal muscles (rectus abdominis) are clearly delineated, showing six-pack definition. The pectoral muscles are broad and well-defined, extending naturally from the chest. The arms display strong biceps, triceps, and forearms, with clear separation between muscle groups. These features align with classical ideals of male physique in sculpture, where muscular definition is emphasized for strength and nobility. Compared to Image A, the proportions are maintained, though the sculptural style enhances the relief and depth. The accuracy of muscle anatomy suggests careful retention of the original physical form.",

      "question": "Is the subject still framed within a central arch-like structure, maintaining the original spatial composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the subject positioned centrally within an arched architectural frame, similar to Image A. The background includes curved lines and ornamental carvings that suggest a niche or alcove, reinforcing the sense of a sacred or ceremonial space. The arch is symmetrical and encloses the figure, preserving the original spatial composition. In classical art, such framing devices are used to focus attention on the central figure and convey importance. The transition to a sculptural style does not disrupt this compositional balance; instead, it enhances the sense of depth and grandeur. Thus, the arch-like structure and spatial arrangement remain intact.",
