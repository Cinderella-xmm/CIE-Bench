      "question": "Is the central arched doorway with a cross above it present in the same position on the church facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church is depicted inside a decorative glass dome as a miniature scene. The central arched doorway is clearly visible and positioned in the center of the facade, directly beneath a cross. This placement matches typical architectural design for churches, where the main entrance is centrally located and often adorned with religious symbols like a cross above it. The visual cues confirm that the cross is centered above the doorway, which is consistent with real-world ecclesiastical architecture. Comparing this to Image A, the same structural elements are present in identical positions, confirming that the relative placement has been preserved in the miniature version.",

      "question": "Is the round window located directly above the central doorway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the round window (oculus) is visible on the upper part of the church facade, positioned above the central doorway. It is centered horizontally, aligning with the symmetry of the building's design. This is a common feature in Baroque or neoclassical church architecture, where oculus windows serve both aesthetic and functional purposes. In Image A, the same round window is located directly above the central doorway, maintaining the same vertical alignment. The miniature representation in Image B accurately reflects this architectural detail, preserving its position relative to the entrance.",

      "question": "Is the bell tower with a dome and spire visible above the church roof?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bell tower is clearly visible rising above the church roof. It features a dome topped with a spire, consistent with traditional church architecture. The structure includes a small bell visible within an opening, indicating its function as a belfry. The presence of the dome and spire is a key identifying feature of the church’s silhouette. When compared to Image A, the same bell tower with a dome and spire is present in the same location, confirming that the edited image maintains accurate architectural details. Therefore, the bell tower is indeed visible and correctly represented.",

      "question": "Are white umbrellas positioned over tables to the left of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two white umbrellas placed over small tables on the left side of the church, near the base of the miniature scene. These umbrellas are proportionally scaled down but match the appearance of outdoor café seating. The positioning corresponds to the left side of the church from the viewer's perspective. In Image A, the same arrangement of white umbrellas over café tables is visible on the left side of the church. The edited image retains this element accurately, suggesting that the café setup is faithfully reproduced in the miniature model.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a transparent, crystalline tree is visible on the left side of the scene, adjacent to the café area under the umbrellas. While not a natural tree, it serves as a symbolic or decorative representation of a tree. Its placement mirrors the position of the actual tree seen in Image A, which stands near the café on the left side of the church. Although the material differs (crystal vs. real foliage), the spatial relationship between the tree and the café remains consistent. Thus, despite being stylized, a tree-like object is present in the same location.",

      "question": "Are curved stone steps leading up to the church entrance visible on the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, curved stone steps are visible on the right side of the church, leading upward toward the entrance. These steps are sculpted into the base of the miniature display and follow the same arc as those in the original scene. In Image A, similar curved steps are present on the right side, forming part of the plaza's design. The edited image preserves this architectural feature, ensuring continuity in layout and perspective. The steps are clearly modeled in the diorama, even if slightly simplified due to scale.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building to the left of the church is not shown with blue-and-white tiles or black metal balconies. Instead, it appears as a plain wall or backdrop within the diorama, lacking detailed ornamentation. In contrast, Image A clearly shows a neighboring building with distinctive blue-and-white azulejo tiles and black wrought-iron balconies, characteristic of Portuguese architecture. The miniature version omits these specific details, likely due to scale limitations or artistic choice. Therefore, this architectural feature is absent in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bell tower is topped with a spire, and at its apex, a small cross is clearly visible. This detail is consistent with Christian church architecture, where crosses are often placed at the highest point of a structure. The cross is proportionally small but distinct against the sky reflected in the glass dome. In Image A, the same cross is visible at the top of the bell tower, confirming that this feature has been accurately preserved in the miniature representation. The presence of the cross is both visually and symbolically significant.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof of the church is depicted with red tiles, particularly visible on the sloped sections and the dome of the bell tower. The color and texture resemble traditional terracotta roofing, commonly used in Mediterranean and Iberian architecture. In Image A, the same red-tiled roof is evident, matching the style and color. The miniature version accurately reproduces this feature, maintaining the authenticity of the church’s appearance. Thus, the red tile roof is present and correctly represented.",
