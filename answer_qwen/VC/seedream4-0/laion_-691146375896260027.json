      "question": "Is the overall bombe (curved, outward-bulging) silhouette of the commode preserved in the LEGO version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO version of the commode maintains a distinct outward-curving profile on its sides and front, consistent with the classic 'bombe' form seen in 18th-century French furniture. Despite being constructed from blocky LEGO bricks, the curvature is clearly represented through layered brick placement that mimics the rounded, swelling shape. This design choice reflects an intentional effort to preserve the original's silhouette, even though the material limits smoothness. The visual cues—such as the gradual widening of the body from top to bottom and the inward tapering at the base—confirm that the bombe shape is faithfully reproduced in a stylized but recognizable manner.",

      "question": "Are there exactly two drawers stacked vertically on the front of the dresser, each framed by brass mounts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the LEGO model, the front of the dresser features two distinct horizontal sections separated by a visible seam, indicating two drawers. Each drawer is outlined by golden-colored LEGO pieces arranged in ornate frames that mimic brass mounts. These frames follow the contours of the drawers and extend into decorative scrollwork, consistent with the function of framing and accentuating drawer fronts. The symmetry and positioning confirm that these are intended to represent two stacked drawers. While the material is not actual brass, the structural and aesthetic representation aligns with the description.",

      "question": "Is the herringbone and starburst marquetry pattern visible on the front of both drawers in the LEGO version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO version uses varying shades of brown bricks to simulate wood grain and inlay patterns. On the front of both drawers, there is a geometric arrangement of bricks forming diagonal lines that resemble herringbone patterns. Additionally, a central star-like motif is formed by darker and lighter bricks converging toward the center, suggesting a starburst design. Although the resolution is limited by the pixelated nature of LEGO bricks, the intentional use of color and brick orientation indicates an attempt to replicate the marquetry. The patterns are clearly visible and match the general layout expected in such a piece.",

      "question": "Are the ornate brass mounts with acanthus leaf scrolls present around the edges of both drawers and along the side panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO model includes golden-colored elements that trace the outlines of the drawers and extend along the side panels. These elements feature curved, branching forms that closely resemble acanthus leaf scrolls—a hallmark of Rococo design. The scrolls are particularly evident at the corners and midpoints of the drawer frames, where they curve outward in a naturalistic fashion. Similar motifs appear along the vertical edges of the side panels, reinforcing the ornamental continuity. Though simplified due to the modular nature of LEGO, the design successfully emulates the intricate brass mounts found on the original.",

      "question": "Do the legs curve outward in a cabriole fashion and terminate in brass sabots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The legs of the LEGO commode are visibly curved, starting narrow at the top and sweeping outward before tapering down to the feet. This S-shaped curve is characteristic of cabriole legs, commonly used in Baroque and Rococo furniture. At the bottom, the legs end in small, golden-colored blocks that serve as sabots (metal caps), matching the brass finish of the other decorative elements. While the curves are slightly less fluid than those in real wood due to the blocky construction, the overall form clearly represents cabriole legs with brass sabots.",

      "question": "Is there a scalloped apron below the drawers, following the curve of the bombe shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Below the drawers, the LEGO model features a lower section that follows the outward curve of the bombe silhouette. This area is constructed with a series of bricks arranged in a wavy, undulating pattern that creates a scalloped effect. The apron extends horizontally and gently dips downward in the center, mirroring the elegant contour of traditional commodes. This detail is consistent with the design of the original, where the apron serves both a decorative and structural purpose, enhancing the flowing lines of the piece.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top surface of the LEGO commode is made of gray LEGO tiles arranged in a flat, rectangular plane. It sits directly atop the main body of the dresser and appears level with the upper edge, without overhanging or recessing. This matches the typical construction of a commode with a marble top, where the surface is designed to be flush for stability and aesthetic balance. The clean, straight edges and uniform height confirm that the top is indeed rectangular and flush.",

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the decorative elements (brass mounts, marquetry, legs) symmetrically arranged on both sides of the dresser?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO model exhibits clear bilateral symmetry. The brass mounts (golden elements) are mirrored on both sides of the front and along the side panels. The marquetry patterns on the drawers are identical in layout and color scheme on both halves. The legs are evenly spaced and shaped identically on each side, with the same cabriole curve and brass sabot finishes. Even the subtle details, such as the placement of scrollwork and the alignment of brick patterns, are mirrored across the central axis. This symmetry is essential to the classical design of such furniture and is accurately replicated in the LEGO version.",
