      "question": "Does the edited image retain the swirling vortex texture in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B displays a dynamic pattern of swirling, circular forms with radiating lines and concentric circles around the stars and moon, consistent with the characteristic vortex-like texture seen in Van Gogh's 'Starry Night.' The brushstrokes are thick and expressive, creating a sense of motion and turbulence. This visual style is preserved in the edited image, even though a squirrel has been added in the foreground. The background elements, including the sky, remain unchanged in their artistic execution. Based on world knowledge of Van Gogh’s technique and the visual continuity of the sky’s design, it is clear that the swirling vortex texture is retained.",

      "question": "Is the prominent cypress tree on the left side of the image still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a tall, dark, flame-like structure is visible on the left side of the composition, which matches the iconic cypress tree from Van Gogh's original painting. Although a squirrel has been superimposed in front of it, the silhouette and shape of the cypress tree remain clearly identifiable. The tree’s position, height, and form are consistent with its appearance in the original work. The addition of the squirrel does not obscure or remove the tree; rather, it is integrated into the scene such that the tree remains a dominant feature. Therefore, based on both visual evidence and contextual understanding of the original artwork, the cypress tree is still present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The village, including the distinct church with a pointed steeple, is visible in the lower central portion of Image B. Its placement and architectural features—such as the clustered houses and illuminated windows—are consistent with the original composition. Despite the addition of the squirrel in the foreground, the village remains unaltered in terms of location, structure, and detail. The spatial layout of the town and its alignment with the surrounding landscape confirm that this element has been preserved. Using world knowledge of the original painting and visual comparison, it is evident that the village with the church steeple is still present in the same position.",

      "question": "Are the rolling hills visible in the background of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, behind the village and beneath the swirling sky, there are dark, undulating shapes that represent the rolling hills. These hills are painted with the same textured brushwork and blue tones as in the original, contributing to the depth and landscape perspective. Their presence is consistent with the original painting’s composition, where they frame the village and lead the viewer’s eye toward the horizon. Even with the addition of the squirrel, the hills remain visually intact and identifiable. Thus, based on both visual analysis and knowledge of the original artwork, the rolling hills are indeed visible in the background.",

      "question": "Does the image retain the original blue and yellow color palette and thick brushstroke texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the dominant blue and yellow color scheme characteristic of Van Gogh’s 'Starry Night,' with deep blues in the sky and hills contrasted by bright yellows in the stars, moon, and highlights on buildings. The brushwork remains thick and impasto-like, with visible strokes that create texture and movement. The addition of the squirrel introduces new colors (browns, grays, whites), but these do not override the overall palette or disrupt the original textural style. The squirrel itself appears to be rendered in a realistic style, yet it is seamlessly integrated into the painted environment without altering the underlying aesthetic. Therefore, despite the edit, the core visual characteristics—color palette and brushstroke texture—are preserved.",
