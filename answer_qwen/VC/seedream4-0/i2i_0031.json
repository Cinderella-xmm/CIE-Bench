      "question": "Does the edited image retain the distinctive curved shape and brown-spotted texture of the bananas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) is a stylized, cartoon-like illustration of a yellow car with a structure resembling a lifeguard tower on top. There are no bananas present in this image at all. The visual elements include geometric shapes and flat colors, typical of simplified graphic design, with no depiction of food items or kitchen ingredients. Therefore, based on the visual content, the bananas from the original image (Image A) are completely absent in Image B. This conclusion is drawn by analyzing the content of Image B and recognizing that it does not contain any realistic or symbolic representation of bananas, let alone their curved shape or spotted texture.",

      "question": "Are the chocolate chips represented as small, round, and dark brown in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no chocolate chips visible. The image consists of a yellow car with a tower-like structure on top, rendered in a minimalist, vector-style art form. There are no food items, nor any objects resembling chocolate chips. Since chocolate chips are not present in Image B, they cannot be described as small, round, or dark brown within this image. This conclusion is based on direct observation of the image content and an understanding that chocolate chips would need to be visually identifiable as such—typically as small, dark, circular shapes—which are entirely absent here.",

      "question": "Are the butter chunks shown as small, pale yellow cubes in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains no representation of butter or any food ingredient. It features a cartoon-style yellow car with a tower structure above it, using solid colors and simple outlines. There are no pale yellow cubes or any indication of butter chunks. Butter, when depicted realistically, is often shown as soft, pale yellow pieces, but in this edited image, no such elements exist. Therefore, based on visual analysis and world knowledge about how butter is typically illustrated, the butter chunks from Image A are not present in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the flour depicted as a fine, white powder contained within a bowl in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any bowls or powdery substances. Instead, it shows a stylized vehicle with a tower-like structure, composed of basic geometric shapes and bright colors. Flour, when shown in real-life images, is usually a white, granular substance in a container like a bowl. In Image B, there is no such object or material present. Thus, based on visual inspection and common knowledge of how flour is represented, it is clear that flour is not depicted in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the stainless steel kitchen mixer present in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a simplified, illustrative drawing of a yellow car with a tower on its roof. It lacks any kitchen appliances or equipment. The stainless steel kitchen mixer seen in Image A is a detailed, metallic appliance with a bowl and control panel, which is not present in Image B. The background of Image B is plain and minimalistic, with no indication of a kitchen setting or any machinery. Therefore, by comparing the content of both images and applying world knowledge about what a kitchen mixer looks like, it is evident that the mixer is absent in the edited image.",
