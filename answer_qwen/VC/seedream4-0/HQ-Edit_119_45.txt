    "Question": "Q1: Is the nemes headdress present with its characteristic wide, striped, layered shape covering the head and shoulders?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the nemes headdress is indeed visible, featuring the traditional wide, striped pattern composed of alternating blue and gold bands. These stripes extend from the top of the head down over the shoulders, consistent with the classic Egyptian royal headdress design. The layered structure is clearly depicted, maintaining the historical form seen in ancient pharaonic iconography. Although there are added mechanical elements (such as gears and wings), the base structure of the nemes remains intact and recognizable. This confirms that the headdress retains its characteristic shape despite the steampunk modifications.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the uraeus cobra positioned centrally on the forehead, above the eyes?",
    "explanation": "The uraeus, a symbolic rearing cobra, is traditionally placed at the center of the forehead in ancient Egyptian royal imagery. In Image B, a stylized cobra-like element is present at the top center of the forehead, directly above the eyes. It is integrated into the crown structure and appears to be part of the ornamental design. While it is not a realistic depiction of a cobra due to the artistic fusion with mechanical elements, its central placement aligns with the traditional positioning of the uraeus. Thus, based on both visual cues and cultural knowledge, the uraeus is present in its expected location.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a false beard extending vertically from the chin, matching the original pleated form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the area below the chin does not feature a traditional false beard. Instead, the neck transitions into a series of mechanical components, including pipes, gears, and a clock face, which replace the typical pleated false beard seen in ancient Egyptian funerary masks like that of Tutankhamun. The absence of any vertical, pleated extension from the chin indicates that the false beard has been omitted or replaced by steampunk-style machinery. Therefore, while the concept of a beard may be symbolically represented through industrial design, the actual pleated false beard is not present.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the eyes almond-shaped and positioned symmetrically beneath thick eyebrows?",
    "explanation": "The eyes in Image B are distinctly almond-shaped, a common feature in ancient Egyptian art meant to convey divine or regal presence. They are symmetrically placed beneath bold, dark, thick eyebrows that follow the traditional style. The symmetry is maintained across the face, and the eye shape is consistent with classical depictions of pharaohs. Despite the metallic and mechanical embellishments, the facial features retain their iconic proportions and alignment. Thus, the eyes conform to the expected aesthetic and structural norms of Egyptian royal portraiture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the ears present on both sides of the head, with natural human ear shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both ears are visible on either side of the head. They are rendered in a naturalistic human form, with defined helix, antihelix, and lobe structures. This matches the anatomical accuracy typically seen in representations of pharaohs, where ears were often depicted realistically even within stylized contexts. The addition of mechanical wings behind the ears does not obscure or distort the ear shape itself. Therefore, the ears are present and accurately shaped.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a broad collar encircling the neck, maintaining its original width and horizontal band structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the collar around the neck is highly modified. While it retains some horizontal banding and decorative patterns reminiscent of traditional Egyptian broad collars, it is heavily integrated with mechanical elements such as gears, pipes, and a clock face. The width appears broader than typical, and the structure is no longer purely horizontal bands but includes vertical and circular components. The original form of the broad collar—characterized by flat, horizontal rows of ornamentation—is disrupted by the steampunk additions. Hence, although inspired by the original design, the collar does not maintain its original width and band structure.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the mask presented in a strictly frontal, symmetrical view with no rotation or tilt?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the figure in a frontal pose, with the face centered and aligned directly toward the viewer. The symmetry of facial features—eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, and ears—is preserved. There is no visible rotation or tilt of the head; the axis of the face is perpendicular to the viewer’s perspective. Even though the surrounding mechanical elements (like wings) add complexity, they are symmetrically placed, reinforcing the frontal and balanced composition. Thus, the mask is displayed in a strictly frontal, symmetrical manner.",
    "answer": "Yes"
