    "Question": "Q1: Is the feathered plume still present on top of the knight's helmet?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the knight is depicted in a stylized, chibi-like form inside a glass dome. The helmet is clearly visible, and it features a rounded, simplified design typical of cartoonish or toy-style figures. There is no visible feathered plume on top of the helmet. This contrasts with the more realistic and detailed armor seen in traditional depictions of knights, where plumes are often used for identification or ceremonial purposes. Given the artistic style of this image, which emphasizes cuteness and simplicity over realism, the absence of a plume is consistent with the overall aesthetic. Therefore, based on visual evidence and stylistic context, the plume is not present.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the rampant lion emblem clearly visible on the shield?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the knight’s shield is round and metallic, reflecting light in a way that suggests a polished surface. However, the details on the shield are minimal and lack intricate engravings. While the shape and general design of the shield resemble those in medieval heraldry, there is no discernible rampant lion or any other coat-of-arms symbol. The surface appears smooth and featureless, likely due to the stylized nature of the character. In contrast, historical shields often bore detailed emblems like lions to represent lineage or allegiance. Since no such emblem is visible here, the answer is no.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the knight holding a long spear or lance in their right hand?",
    "explanation": "The knight in Image B is holding a short, slender weapon in their right hand. Based on its length and proportions relative to the knight's body, it does not qualify as a long spear or lance. Instead, it resembles a small sword or dagger, consistent with the toy-like scale and exaggerated proportions of the figure. A true lance would be significantly longer, extending beyond the knight's height, which is not the case here. Therefore, despite the presence of a weapon, it is not a long spear or lance.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the knight's pauldrons and greaves visibly present in the armor?",
    "explanation": "Pauldrons (shoulder armor) and greaves (shin guards) are standard components of medieval plate armor. In Image B, the knight’s armor includes shoulder pieces that are clearly defined and extend from the chest plate up to the shoulders—these are identifiable as pauldrons. Similarly, the lower legs are covered in articulated metal plates that extend from the knee down to the foot, matching the appearance of greaves. These elements are present and proportionally consistent with the rest of the armor, even though the overall design is stylized. Thus, both pauldrons and greaves are visibly present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the castle's main turret with a conical roof and flagpole still visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a stone tower with a conical roof and multiple crenellations, which matches the architectural style of a medieval castle turret. At the very top of the turret, there is a small spire or pole, consistent with a flagpole. Although the scene is contained within a glass dome and slightly stylized, the key features—the conical roof and the vertical element at the apex—are clearly visible. This aligns with common representations of castles in fantasy art, where turrets often include flagpoles for banners. Therefore, the main turret with its conical roof and flagpole is indeed visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are strands of ivy hanging down from the top of the archway?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is enclosed within a glass dome, and the environment has been reimagined into a miniature diorama. While there are green vines visible near the top of the dome, they appear to be part of the decorative interior rather than hanging from an archway. The original archway structure from Image A is absent; instead, the scene is framed by the curved glass. The ivy-like plants are positioned along the upper edge of the dome but do not hang from a stone archway. Therefore, although there are plant elements, they are not hanging from an archway as described.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q7: Is the knight positioned facing toward the right side of the image, with the shield on the left arm?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the knight is standing upright and facing forward, directly toward the viewer. The shield is held in the left hand, which is consistent with traditional knightly posture when defending. However, the knight is not angled toward the right side of the image; rather, they are centered and facing straight ahead. Their orientation is frontal, not lateral. Therefore, while the shield is correctly placed on the left arm, the knight is not facing toward the right side of the image.",
    "answer": "No"
