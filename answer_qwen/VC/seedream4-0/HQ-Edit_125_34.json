      "question": "Is the central carved wooden panel with floral and scrollwork detailing behind the desk present and unaltered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central carved wooden panel behind the desk is clearly visible. It features intricate floral and scrollwork detailing consistent with ornate Victorian or Gothic Revival styles. The design appears symmetrical and elaborate, matching the aesthetic of a traditional study. Based on visual inspection, the panel's pattern and structure remain intact and unchanged from its original form. There are no signs of damage, alteration, or replacement. This conclusion is drawn from comparing the detailed craftsmanship, symmetry, and material consistency with typical historical woodcarving standards.",

      "question": "Are the two large multi-paned windows positioned symmetrically on either side of the desk, with intact glass panes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two windows are indeed positioned symmetrically on either side of the desk. However, unlike in Image A where they appear as standard rectangular multi-paned windows, these have been transformed into arched, ornate wrought-iron-framed windows with decorative metalwork, including gears and floral motifs. While still multi-paned, their shape and framing are significantly altered, incorporating a steampunk aesthetic. The glass panes appear intact, but the overall structure is not the same as in the original image. Therefore, while the symmetry and intactness of the panes are preserved, the window design itself has been changed.",

      "question": "Are the dark gray drapes tied back at both windows, maintaining their original folds and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, dark gray drapes are present at both windows and are tied back, similar to Image A. However, due to the transformation of the windows into arched, ornate frames, the drapes now hang differently—adjusted to fit the new arch shape. Their folds and positioning are not identical to the original straight-edged windows. The drapes appear more gathered and adapted to the curved top of the windows, indicating a change in their configuration. Thus, although they are tied back, their folds and positions are altered compared to the original.",

      "question": "Is the tufted leather armchair visible on the left side of the frame, partially in view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left side of the frame shows a portion of what appears to be a dark leather seating piece. However, it is not clearly identifiable as a tufted leather armchair. The visible part lacks the distinct button-tufting and cushioned back typical of such furniture. Additionally, the lighting and angle obscure full visibility. In contrast, Image A clearly shows a tufted leather armchair. Given that the focus in Image B has shifted toward mechanical and steampunk elements, the chair may have been removed or repositioned. Therefore, based on visual evidence, the armchair is not clearly visible or recognizable in this version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a patterned rug is visible beneath the desk, featuring intricate designs typical of Persian-style rugs. It extends from under the desk toward the foreground, covering a significant portion of the floor. The color scheme includes deep blues, reds, and golds, consistent with traditional Persian carpets. The rug’s placement and orientation match the original setup in Image A. No major changes in its position or design are evident. Therefore, despite the surrounding alterations, the rug remains present and in its original location.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a computer monitor with a silver stand and flat screen is indeed present on the desk, located in approximately the same position as in Image A. However, the content displayed on the screen has changed—from a world map to a glowing blue 3D wireframe cube, suggesting a technological or futuristic theme. Despite this change in display, the physical monitor remains in place, with no indication of relocation or replacement. Thus, while the screen content differs, the monitor itself is still present and in its original position.",

      "question": "Is the wooden radiator visible beneath the left window, aligned with the baseboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area beneath the left window does not show a wooden radiator. Instead, the space appears darker and less defined, possibly due to shadowing or the removal of the radiator. In Image A, a wooden radiator was clearly visible beneath the left window, aligned with the baseboard. In contrast, Image B replaces this element with a more industrial or mechanical look, potentially incorporating pipes or other steampunk devices. The absence of the wooden radiator and its replacement with different fixtures indicates a deliberate change in the room’s design. Therefore, the wooden radiator is not present in Image B.",
