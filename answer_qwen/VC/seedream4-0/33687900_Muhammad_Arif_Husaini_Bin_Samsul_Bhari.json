      "question": "Are the bright red flowers in the lower-left foreground still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower-left foreground still features clusters of bright red flowers with green foliage, consistent with their appearance in the original image. These flowers are clearly visible and maintain their position relative to the surrounding vegetation. The red blooms appear to be part of a flowering plant, possibly a species like *Miconia* or similar tropical flora, which commonly grow in such lush environments. Despite the fantastical transformation of the waterfall into a luminous figure, the foreground elements—including the red flowers—remain intact and undisturbed. This suggests that the digital edit preserved the natural foreground details while altering only the central feature of the scene.",

      "question": "Is the large green leaf in the bottom-right corner still visible and in the same position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The large green leaf in the bottom-right corner is indeed still visible in Image B and occupies the same spatial position as in the original image. Its shape, size, and orientation are consistent with what would be expected from a broad-leafed tropical plant, such as a philodendron or heliconia. The leaf appears slightly darker and more saturated due to lighting adjustments in the edited image, but its placement and form remain unchanged. This indicates that the editing process maintained the framing elements of the composition while focusing on transforming the central waterfall area.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the palm-like fronds with fan-shaped leaves are still visible on the right side of the waterfall in Image B. These distinctive fronds, characteristic of ferns or palms such as *Cyathea* or *Pteris*, retain their structure and positioning relative to the waterfall. Although the overall scene has been enhanced with magical effects, the natural vegetation remains largely unaltered. The presence of these fronds contributes to the jungle ambiance and provides a contrast to the ethereal blue figure now occupying the waterfall’s space. Their continuity supports the idea that the edit was focused on replacing the water flow rather than modifying the surrounding flora.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moss-covered rock formation at the top of the waterfall's origin point is no longer clearly visible. In the original image (Image A), this rocky outcrop is prominent, covered in green moss and surrounded by dense foliage. However, in the edited version, the upper portion of the waterfall has been transformed into a glowing, translucent figure with flowing hair and an icy crown, obscuring the actual rock formation. While the general terrain and elevation suggest the same location, the visual details of the mossy rocks have been replaced or blended into the fantasy element. Therefore, the specific moss-covered rock formation is not discernible in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the dense tropical vegetation on both sides of the waterfall still present and forming a natural frame around the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the dense tropical vegetation on both sides of the waterfall remains present in Image B and continues to form a natural frame around the scene. The lush greenery, including various shrubs, ferns, and trees, is consistent with the original environment. The editing process did not remove or alter the surrounding forest; instead, it superimposed a fantastical figure over the waterfall while preserving the background context. This maintains the immersive jungle atmosphere and ensures that the viewer still perceives the scene as being set in a richly vegetated tropical location. The framing effect provided by the vegetation enhances the surreal nature of the central figure without disrupting the environmental integrity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the pool area at the base of the waterfall is still located in the same position in Image B, although its appearance has dramatically changed. In the original image, the pool is a dark, natural body of water receiving the cascade. In the edited version, it has been transformed into a glowing, circular basin emitting swirling patterns of light, resembling a magical fountain. Despite this transformation, the spatial location of the pool remains consistent with the original scene—it is directly beneath where the waterfall once flowed. This indicates that the edit retained the geographical layout of the landscape while reimagining the water feature as a mystical entity. Thus, the pool’s position is preserved, even though its form and function have been altered.",
