      "question": "Is there a glowing arc reactor at the center of the chest of the chibi-style figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figurine is clearly visible inside a transparent display case. The chest area features a circular, illuminated element that matches the appearance of Iron Man's arc reactor. This glow is consistent with the design of the arc reactor seen in Iron Man depictions across media, where it serves as both a power source and a visual signature. The light is bright and white, centered on the chest plate, which aligns with the iconic placement and function of the arc reactor. Based on this visual evidence and world knowledge of Iron Man’s suit design, the glowing arc reactor is present.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine retain the red and gold color scheme of the original Iron Man suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figurine in Image B displays a predominantly red suit with gold accents on the shoulders, forearms, and legs—consistent with the classic Iron Man armor color palette. While the proportions are stylized due to the chibi design (larger head, smaller body), the color scheme remains faithful to the original. World knowledge confirms that Iron Man’s suit is traditionally red and gold, and this figurine adheres to that standard, even in its simplified form. Therefore, the color scheme is retained.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine retain the distinctive shape and features of Iron Man's helmet/mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine has a large, round head with brown hair and simple facial features—large black eyes, small ears, and a subtle smile—typical of the chibi art style. However, unlike the original Iron Man suit, which includes a full helmet with a visor and angular facial structure, this figurine does not have a helmet or mask. Instead, it shows a human face with no metallic covering. This indicates that the distinctive helmet/mask features of Iron Man are absent, replaced by a cartoonish human representation. Thus, while the suit is present, the helmet/mask is not retained.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine retain a pose that reflects confidence, similar to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figurine stands upright with arms slightly away from the body and feet planted firmly on the base. This posture suggests stability and readiness, but due to the exaggerated proportions and simplified design typical of chibi figures, it lacks the dynamic, assertive stance seen in the original Iron Man (Image A), where the character appears more heroic and dominant. The original image shows a powerful, forward-facing pose with one hand extended, conveying confidence and strength. In contrast, the chibi version’s pose is neutral and static, lacking the same level of expressive confidence. Therefore, while it maintains a standing position, it does not fully reflect the confident pose of the original.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine rest on a silver-gray metallic-textured platform at the base of the transparent display box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is housed within a clear acrylic display case. At the bottom of this case, there is a base that is silver-gray in color and features a diamond plate texture, commonly used in industrial designs to simulate metal. This textured platform supports the figurine and is clearly visible beneath it. This detail aligns with common collectible packaging practices, where such bases enhance presentation and durability. The visual cues confirm the presence of a silver-gray metallic-textured platform.",
