      "question": "Is the vertical facial split between black and white fur still present, dividing the face precisely down the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's face displays a distinct vertical division between two contrasting colors. The left side of the face (from the viewer’s perspective) is dark brown with wood grain texture, while the right side is light cream-colored, also mimicking wood grain. This division runs directly down the center of the face, aligning symmetrically with the nose and eyes. Although the material has changed from fur to wood, the pattern of the split remains consistent with a central division. Based on visual analysis, the split is precise and symmetrical, mirroring the original concept of a facial division. Thus, even though the texture and material have been altered, the structural layout of the split remains intact.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both eyes large, round, and positioned symmetrically on either side of the facial split, with visible highlights reflecting light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes in Image B are indeed large and round, consistent with stylized animal representations. They are placed symmetrically on either side of the central facial split, maintaining balance in the design. Each eye features a glossy surface with a small highlight that reflects light, suggesting a polished finish typical of carved wooden objects. These highlights enhance the three-dimensional appearance and give the eyes a lifelike quality despite being part of a wooden sculpture. The symmetry and placement are carefully preserved, indicating intentional artistic design.",

      "question": "Is the dog in an upright sitting position with both front paws flat on the ground and hind legs tucked beneath the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dog in a seated posture. The front paws are clearly flat on the wooden base, and the hind legs are folded underneath the body, which is characteristic of a classic sitting pose. The overall posture is stable and balanced, typical of a decorative figurine. This positioning is consistent with the original image's stance, but now adapted to the wooden medium. The craftsmanship ensures that the dog maintains an upright and composed appearance, reinforcing the idea of a static display piece.",

      "question": "Are both ears pointed upward, erect, and symmetrical, with visible pink inner surfaces and dark outer edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ears are pointed upward and appear erect, contributing to the alert expression of the dog. However, unlike the original image where the inner ear surfaces were pink, the ears in this version are made of wood and show no pink coloring. Instead, they feature natural wood tones with darker edges and lighter centers, consistent with the rest of the carving. While symmetrical and well-defined, the inner surfaces are not pink but rather follow the wood grain pattern. Therefore, although the shape and orientation are correct, the color detail differs significantly.",

      "question": "Is the black nose centered on the white muzzle, with visible whisker lines extending from the sides of the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nose in Image B is centrally located on the muzzle, which is rendered in a light cream tone resembling wood. It is dark in color, matching the description of a 'black' nose. Additionally, there are fine engraved lines on either side of the snout that represent whiskers, drawn as simple curved strokes. These lines are clearly visible and extend outward from the muzzle, mimicking the appearance of real whiskers. Though not actual hair, these etched lines serve the same visual purpose in the context of a wooden sculpture.",

      "question": "Is there a collar visible around the dog’s neck with at least one tag hanging from it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, a collar is clearly visible around the dog’s neck in Image B. It is metallic in appearance, with a silver or chrome-like finish, and features a small ring from which two tags hang. One tag appears oval-shaped, and the other is circular, both reflecting light and showing detail consistent with metal. This matches the presence of a collar and tags seen in the original image, though here the materials are adapted to fit the wooden theme. The inclusion of tags suggests personalization, common in pet-themed figurines.",
