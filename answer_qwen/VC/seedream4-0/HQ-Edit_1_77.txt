    "Question": "Q1: Is the multi-layered beaded neckpiece composed of alternating red, white, blue, and black horizontal bands still present in the same layered structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the neckpiece is clearly visible and consists of multiple horizontal bands made of beads. The colors red, white, blue, and black are present in an alternating pattern, consistent with the description. The structure remains layered, forming a thick collar around the neck. The visual texture and arrangement suggest continuity in the design, which aligns with traditional African beadwork styles seen in cultures such as the Maasai or Samburu.
