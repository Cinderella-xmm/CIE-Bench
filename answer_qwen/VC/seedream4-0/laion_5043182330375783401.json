      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure has a prominent mustache that is clearly visible and well-defined above the upper lip. The mustache is thick, curved, and stylistically rendered in a way consistent with classic depictions of mustaches in portraiture. It stands out due to its dark coloration and distinct shape, which contrasts with the lighter skin tone. This feature is preserved from the original image (Image A), but in Image B, it is stylized with sharp edges and geometric forms, yet remains unmistakably present and clearly defined. The artistic style enhances its visibility rather than obscuring it.",

      "question": "Are both eyes closed in the facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure’s eyes are open, not closed. The eyelids are clearly drawn with defined shapes, and the pupils are visible, indicating an alert and direct gaze. This contrasts with Image A, where the subject appears to have closed eyes, suggesting a more contemplative or relaxed state. In Image B, the artist has chosen to depict the subject with open eyes, possibly to convey confidence or awareness. The change in eye state reflects a shift in emotional tone from the original sketch to the stylized version, aligning with the more dynamic and modern aesthetic of the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the figure’s right arm resting on the back of the chair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure’s right arm is indeed resting on the back of the chair. The arm is bent at the elbow, with the forearm extending along the vertical lines of the chair’s backrest. The hand is placed firmly on the top edge of the chair, suggesting a relaxed yet composed posture. This positioning is consistent with the original pose in Image A, where the right arm is similarly placed. However, in Image B, the arm and chair are rendered in a highly stylized, geometric manner, with sharp angles and metallic textures, emphasizing form over realism. Despite the abstraction, the spatial relationship between the arm and the chair remains clear and accurate.",

      "question": "Is the figure depicted in a seated position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the figure in Image B is clearly depicted in a seated position. The body is oriented upright, with the lower half positioned behind the chair, and the legs partially visible beneath the seat. The posture is formal, with one arm resting on the chair’s back and the other likely supported by the lap or side, though not fully visible. The chair itself is designed with a high back and structured seat, reinforcing the idea of sitting. This seating posture is consistent with the original image (Image A), where the subject is also seated. The transformation in Image B maintains this fundamental pose while stylizing the form into a futuristic, angular design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the number '27826' is visible in the bottom right corner of the image. It is rendered in a small, light-colored font, consistent with catalog or inventory numbers often found in art reproductions or museum records. This number matches exactly with the one present in Image A, suggesting that it was retained during the digital editing process. The inclusion of this number indicates that the artwork may be part of a collection or archive, and its preservation across both images implies continuity in documentation. The presence of the number in Image B confirms its retention despite the significant stylistic changes applied to the rest of the composition.",
