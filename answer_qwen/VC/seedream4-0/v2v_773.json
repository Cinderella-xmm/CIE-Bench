      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple is depicted as part of a figurine's head, with its cross-section clearly visible. The central core of the apple shows a small, dark brown seed-like structure located at the center of the cavity where seeds would typically be found in a real apple. This detail is consistent with the anatomy of a typical apple, which usually contains multiple seeds, but in this case, only one prominent seed is visible. Given that the apple appears to be stylized or sculpted (as part of a collectible figure), it may not include all natural seeds for aesthetic or design reasons. However, based on visual inspection, there is indeed a single dark brown seed present in the center. This conclusion aligns with both visual evidence and general knowledge about apple anatomy.",

      "question": "Does the appleâ€™s flesh show a dry, fibrous texture with visible vein-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple's flesh is rendered with fine details that resemble a dry, fibrous texture. The surface displays intricate, web-like patterns resembling veins or fibers, which are characteristic of dried fruit tissue. These patterns are more pronounced than in a fresh apple, suggesting either artistic exaggeration or representation of a slightly dehydrated state. This texture is consistent with how dried apples or aged fruit might appear, and such details are often emphasized in collectible figures for visual interest. Comparing to real-world knowledge, fresh apple flesh is typically moist and smooth, but here the texture suggests an intentional stylistic choice to mimic drying or aging. Therefore, the description matches the visual cues in the image.",

      "question": "Is there a dark brown stem attached to the top of the apple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple is shown as a head of a figurine, and it clearly has a dark brown stem protruding from the top. The stem is short and curved, consistent with the appearance of a real apple stem. Its color and shape match typical botanical features of an apple, even though it is part of a stylized object. The presence of the stem is visually confirmed and does not contradict any known characteristics of apples. Even in the context of a toy or collectible, the stem is accurately represented. Thus, based on direct observation and world knowledge of apple morphology, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Is the apple sliced vertically, exposing a symmetrical cross-section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple is cut cleanly through the middle, revealing a cross-section that is nearly symmetrical along the vertical axis. The two halves of the flesh mirror each other in shape and texture, and the central core with the seed is positioned centrally, indicating a precise vertical cut. This symmetry is consistent with how apples are typically sliced when halved lengthwise. While minor imperfections may exist due to sculpting, the overall impression is one of balanced symmetry. In real life, apples are often sliced vertically to display their internal structure, and this representation follows that convention. Therefore, the visual evidence supports the conclusion that the apple was sliced vertically.",

      "question": "Is the apple placed on a flat, light gray, matte surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple (as part of the figurine) is standing upright on a flat surface. The background and base beneath the figurine and box appear to be a uniform light gray color with a non-reflective, matte finish. There are no visible reflections or glossy highlights, which would suggest a shiny surface. The texture appears smooth and consistent with materials like concrete or painted foam board commonly used in product photography. This surface is also seen under the box and the figurine itself, confirming it extends across the scene. Based on visual cues and common studio setup practices, the surface is indeed flat, light gray, and matte. Therefore, the answer aligns with both observation and contextual understanding of product presentation environments.",
