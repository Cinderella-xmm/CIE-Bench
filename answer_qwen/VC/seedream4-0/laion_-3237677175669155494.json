      "question": "Is the Elizabeth Tower positioned on the right side of the image with a tall, vertical structure topped by a pointed spire and a clock face near the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure on the right side of the image is clearly identifiable as the Elizabeth Tower (commonly known as Big Ben), based on its iconic silhouette and clock face. Although heavily modified in this edited version — transformed into a giant golden robot-like figure with glowing elements and mechanical limbs — it retains the original tower’s vertical orientation, pointed spire at the top, and clock face near the upper section. The transformation is fantastical, but the core architectural identity remains recognizable. This aligns with real-world knowledge that the Elizabeth Tower is located to the right of the Palace of Westminster when viewed from the south bank of the Thames. Therefore, despite the surreal modifications, the tower's position and key structural features are preserved.",

      "question": "Does the building complex on the left side of the image have multiple pointed Gothic spires and a long horizontal facade with repeating arched windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The building complex on the left side of Image B corresponds to the Palace of Westminster. Even though the image has been digitally altered — with organic, glowing vines wrapping around parts of the structure — the underlying architecture still displays the characteristic Gothic Revival style. Multiple pointed spires are visible, especially along the roofline, consistent with the original design of the palace. The long horizontal facade includes rows of arched windows, which are typical of Gothic architecture and match the historical appearance of the building. These features remain distinguishable despite the fantastical overlay, indicating that the core architectural elements are preserved. In comparison to Image A, where these features are unaltered, the changes in Image B are stylistic enhancements rather than structural removals.",

      "question": "Is there a red double-decker bus labeled with route number 53 traveling across the bridge from left to right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a red double-decker bus is visible on the left side of the bridge, moving from left to right. The digital display on the back of the bus clearly shows the number '53', matching the route number mentioned in the question. Although the surrounding environment has been dramatically altered — including robotic figures and flying airships — the bus itself appears largely unchanged in design and color. Its motion direction and positioning are consistent with the original scene in Image A, where a similar bus was present. The route number is legible and matches the description, confirming its presence and movement direction.",

      "question": "Is there a bridge with green metal railings and a paved roadway extending across the image from left to right, connecting the buildings to the right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a bridge that spans horizontally across the scene from left to right. The railings along the sides of the bridge are green, consistent with the appearance of Westminster Bridge in real life. The roadway is paved and clearly defined, supporting vehicular traffic, including buses and cars. This bridge connects the Palace of Westminster on the left to the area on the right side of the frame, which includes the Elizabeth Tower. Despite the addition of futuristic elements such as robots and airships, the bridge’s fundamental structure and function remain intact. Comparing with Image A, the bridge’s layout and coloration are preserved, confirming its presence and continuity in both images.",

      "question": "Is the text “BUS LANE” clearly visible in white lettering on the road surface near the right edge of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the road surface near the right edge of Image B, the words 'BUS LANE' are painted in white capital letters. This marking is clearly legible and positioned in the same location as it would appear in real-world conditions on Westminster Bridge. The paint is bright and contrasts well against the dark asphalt, making it easily readable. This detail is consistent with standard UK road markings for designated bus lanes. In comparison to Image A, the text is present and unaltered, suggesting that even in the fantastical context of Image B, realistic urban details like road signage are retained.",

      "question": "Are there people visible walking on the sidewalk on the right side of the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the right side of the bridge in Image B, a sidewalk is visible adjacent to the roadway. Several human figures can be seen walking along this sidewalk. Their postures and spacing suggest normal pedestrian activity. Although some individuals are partially obscured or blended into the background due to lighting and depth, enough detail is present to confirm their presence. These pedestrians appear to be engaged in typical urban behavior, such as walking or standing. This is consistent with the original scene in Image A, where people were also visible on the same sidewalk. The presence of pedestrians adds realism to the otherwise surreal environment.",

      "question": "Is there a second red double-decker bus with route number 43 visible further down the road on the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Further down the road on the right side of Image B, a second red double-decker bus is visible. It is positioned behind the first bus and closer to the center-right of the frame. The route number displayed on the front of this bus is '43', which matches the description in the question. This bus appears smaller due to perspective, indicating it is farther away. Its design and color are consistent with standard London buses. In comparison to Image A, this bus is also present, confirming its authenticity within the scene. The digital alterations in Image B do not obscure this vehicle, and its route number remains legible.",
