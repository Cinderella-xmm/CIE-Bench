      "question": "Does the edited image retain the representation of a navigational tool (map)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays a surface with lines resembling roads, rivers, and geographical boundaries, which are typical features of a map. These elements are arranged in a way that mimics topographical or road maps, suggesting a navigational purpose. Although the texture is mosaic-like and artistic, the layout still conveys spatial relationships between regions, consistent with a map's function. The presence of pins and connecting lines further supports its use as a navigational tool, even if stylized. Thus, despite the artistic rendering, the core concept of a map as a navigational aid is preserved.",

      "question": "Are there identifiable markers (pins) indicating specific locations/routes on the map?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the image contains several colored pushpins (blue, yellow, green) placed at distinct points across the mosaic surface. These pins are positioned along lines that resemble routes, similar to how location markers are used on physical maps. Their placement suggests they denote specific points of interest or waypoints. This use of pins aligns with common practices in map-making for marking destinations or key locations, reinforcing their role as identifiable markers.",

      "question": "Is there a visible hand interacting with the map, specifically placing a marker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No visible hand is present in the edited image. Unlike the original image, where a hand is seen placing a red pin, the edited version shows only the static arrangement of pins on the mosaic surface. There is no indication of human interaction or motion, nor any part of a person’s body. Therefore, while the pins are present, there is no evidence of ongoing interaction such as placing a marker.",

      "question": "Are the markers (pins) visibly connected, suggesting a planned route?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the pins are connected by colored lines—specifically green and red paths—that trace routes between them. These lines resemble roads or travel paths on a map, linking the pins in a sequence that implies a planned journey or itinerary. This visual connection between markers is a standard method for illustrating routes in navigation, and it is clearly present here, even though the background is stylized.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the wooden surface and the beige sweater sleeve as part of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No, the edited image does not include the wooden surface or the beige sweater sleeve. Instead, the map is rendered as a mosaic tile artwork with no surrounding context of a table or human presence. The background is entirely composed of colorful, irregularly shaped tiles forming the map, eliminating any real-world environmental cues such as wood or clothing. This artistic transformation removes all traces of the original setting.",
