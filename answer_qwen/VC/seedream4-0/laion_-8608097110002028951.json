      "question": "Are the three large arched windows on the upper level of the building present and arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper level of the building features three large arched windows. These windows are evenly spaced and aligned horizontally across the facade, with identical shapes and sizes. The symmetry is maintained by their equal spacing and mirrored positioning relative to the central axis of the building. This arrangement is consistent with architectural symmetry principles commonly seen in historic buildings, especially those designed for visual balance. The use of LEGO bricks does not distort this symmetry; instead, it preserves the original design's proportions. Therefore, based on visual inspection and architectural reasoning, the windows are both present and symmetrically arranged.",

      "question": "Is the tall vertical black sign positioned at the center top of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a tall, narrow, vertical structure made of black LEGO bricks is located directly at the center of the roofline. It rises above the roof and is aligned with the central axis of the building. This matches the position and appearance of a typical marquee or decorative sign often found on theater buildings. Its placement is consistent with the original image (Image A), where such a sign is also centrally located. The LEGO version maintains this central alignment, indicating that the sign is indeed positioned at the center top of the building.",

      "question": "Does the building retain the decorative cornice with spire-like finials along the roofline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roofline features a detailed cornice constructed from LEGO bricks, which includes a series of small, pointed elements resembling spire-like finials. These finials are evenly spaced along the edge of the roof and mirror the ornamental design seen in traditional Spanish or Mission Revival architecture. The LEGO construction replicates this decorative element faithfully, maintaining both the shape and spacing of the original. This detail is consistent with the architectural style of the real-world building, confirming that the decorative cornice with spire-like finials is retained.",

      "question": "Are the Walgreens and Marina Theater signs located on the left and right sides of the ground floor respectively, with red script lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two awnings are visible on the ground floor: one on the left side labeled 'Walgreens' and one on the right labeled 'Marina Theater'. Both signs feature red script lettering on a contrasting background (black for Walgreens and red for Marina Theater). The placement corresponds exactly to the original layout: Walgreens on the left and Marina Theater on the right. The LEGO version accurately reproduces the signage, including the font style and color scheme, ensuring that the signs are correctly positioned and styled.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two vintage-style vehicles made of LEGO bricks parked in front of the building. The car on the left is positioned directly in front of the Walgreens entrance, while the car on the right is placed in front of the Marina Theater entrance. Their orientation and placement suggest they are meant to represent classic automobiles from the early 20th century, consistent with the historical theme of the scene. This positioning mirrors the original image (Image A), where similar vintage cars are parked in the same locations. Thus, the cars are correctly positioned relative to each entrance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small LEGO minifigures can be seen near the entrances of both the Walgreens and Marina Theater. One figure is standing near the Walgreens entrance, and another is near the Marina Theater entrance. These figures appear to be engaged in activities such as walking or standing, adding a sense of scale and life to the scene. While the figures are stylized due to being LEGO models, their presence and positioning confirm that people are indeed visible near both entrances, consistent with typical urban scenes. This detail is preserved from the original image, where real people were also present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a gray LEGO baseplate represents the sidewalk in front of the building. It extends across the entire width of the structure and is separated from the street by a raised curb line made of LEGO bricks. The sidewalk is clearly defined and runs parallel to the buildingâ€™s frontage, matching the layout of the real-world scene. The curb line is visible as a distinct edge between the sidewalk and the road, providing a realistic representation of an urban streetscape. This detail is consistent with both the architectural accuracy and the visual realism of the LEGO model.",
