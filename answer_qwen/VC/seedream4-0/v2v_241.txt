    "Question": "Q1: Is the horse depicted standing on the elephant's back?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is clearly positioned with all four hooves resting on the back of the elephant. The visual cues show the horse’s legs placed directly on the elephant’s dorsal region, indicating that it is standing on top of the elephant. This positioning aligns with the typical interpretation of 'standing on the back' in both real-world and artistic contexts. The horse's posture is upright and balanced, further supporting this conclusion. Based on visual analysis and common understanding of spatial relationships, the horse is indeed depicted as standing on the elephant’s back.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the elephant shown in a posture that supports the horse on its back?",
    "explanation": "The elephant in Image B is depicted in a stable, upright stance with its legs firmly planted on the ground. Its body appears to be bearing weight, consistent with supporting something on its back. Although the elephant is stylized and cartoonish, its posture—especially the slight arching of the back and the positioning of the limbs—suggests it is designed to carry a load. In real-world terms, elephants are known for their strength and ability to support significant weight, and the depiction here reflects that capability in a simplified form. Thus, the elephant's posture is consistent with supporting the horse.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the background retain a photorealistic appearance with a grassy field and sky?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B shows a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds and a flat expanse of green-yellow grass, resembling a savanna or open field. While the overall scene has a stylized, cartoon-like quality due to the characters’ design, the background elements themselves are rendered with realistic textures and lighting. The grass appears detailed with variations in color and shadow, and the sky has natural cloud formations. These visual cues suggest an attempt to maintain a photorealistic environment, even though the foreground subjects are not. Therefore, the background retains a photorealistic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the spatial relationship between the horse and elephant preserved, with the horse positioned above the elephant?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is clearly located above the elephant, with its entire body elevated relative to the elephant’s back. The horse’s hooves are placed directly on the elephant’s dorsal surface, maintaining the same vertical spatial hierarchy seen in many animal stacking scenarios. This arrangement preserves the original spatial relationship from Image A, where the horse was also on top of the elephant. Despite the stylistic differences (e.g., cartoon rendering), the relative positions remain unchanged. The logic of spatial dominance and layering is preserved, confirming that the horse is positioned above the elephant.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the scene displayed within an ornate photo frame?",
    "explanation": "Image B is enclosed by a highly decorative, golden ornate frame with intricate carvings and classical design elements such as floral motifs and scrollwork. This type of frame is typically associated with traditional paintings or formal displays. The frame is clearly visible around the edges of the image and adds a sense of artistry and presentation. Given the visual evidence, the scene is indeed presented within an ornate photo frame, which contrasts with the more direct, unframed presentation of Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
