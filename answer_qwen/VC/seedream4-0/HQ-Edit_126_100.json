      "question": "Is the child still seated on the edge of the path near the water container, facing away from the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small figure resembling a child is visible seated on the edge of the path near a cylindrical object that appears to be a water container. The child is positioned with their back turned toward the main structure (the house), facing downward along the path. This posture and location are consistent with the description in the question. The positioning remains unchanged from what might be expected in a natural setting, and there is no indication of movement or repositioning. Based on visual cues such as body orientation and proximity to the water container, it can be concluded that the child is indeed seated and facing away from the house.",

      "question": "Does the curved concrete path extend from the bottom right corner of the image toward the house without deviation or interruption?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The path in Image B is clearly visible as a light-colored, paved trail curving upward from the bottom right corner of the frame. It follows a smooth arc toward the base of the house, maintaining continuity without any visible breaks or deviations. The path's surface appears intact and unobstructed by natural elements like rocks or vegetation, suggesting it is well-maintained. There are no signs of interruption, such as gaps or detours, and it consistently leads directly to the house’s approach area. Therefore, the path does extend from the bottom right corner toward the house without deviation or interruption.",

      "question": "Is there a smaller building with a rusted corrugated metal roof visible to the left of the main house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To the left of the central treehouse-like structure in Image B, there is a secondary building partially visible. This building has a sloped roof made of corrugated metal sheets, which show signs of rust and weathering, particularly along the edges and upper sections. Its construction style differs from the main house—being more utilitarian and less ornate—and it is situated lower on the slope. These visual characteristics match the description of a smaller building with a rusted corrugated metal roof. The presence of this structure is consistent with rural or semi-rural settings where auxiliary buildings are common.",

      "question": "Are the large green banana leaves and the cluster of bright orange flowers clearly visible in the foreground, just below the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the foreground of Image B, directly beneath the elevated house, there is a prominent banana plant with large, broad green leaves extending outward. Adjacent to this plant, there is a dense cluster of bright orange flowers growing in a bushy formation. These elements are positioned between the house and the path, making them clearly visible and well-lit. Their vivid colors contrast sharply with the surrounding greenery, ensuring they stand out. Given their size and placement, they are unmistakable features of the scene.",

      "question": "Is the satellite dish located on the right side of the upper floor, extending outward from the structure on a black metal pole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, there is no visible satellite dish on the right side of the upper floor. Instead, the structure features organic, tree-like supports and vines growing over its surface. The roofline includes a large, eye-like feature and floral decorations, but no man-made satellite dish is present. In contrast, Image A shows a satellite dish on the right side of the house, attached via a black metal pole. Since Image B lacks this element entirely, the answer must reflect its absence. This change suggests a transformation from a modernized dwelling to a more fantastical, nature-integrated design.",

      "question": "Are the lower ends of the stilts firmly planted in the soil along the slope beneath the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stilts supporting the house in Image B appear to be made of thick, gnarled tree trunks that taper down into the ground. While the exact base is not fully visible due to vegetation and shadows, the stilts seem to merge naturally with the terrain, suggesting they are rooted or anchored into the soil. The surrounding area shows moss-covered earth and plant growth around the stilt bases, indicating long-term integration with the slope. This appearance aligns with typical stilt construction in tropical regions, where structures are built to withstand uneven terrain. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that the lower ends are firmly planted in the soil.",

      "question": "Is the background composed of rolling green hills covered in dense forest, fading into mist under a partly cloudy blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B displays expansive rolling hills densely covered in lush green foliage, characteristic of a tropical or subtropical forest environment. The trees are thick and layered, creating a sense of depth. In the distance, the hills fade into a soft white mist, which adds atmospheric perspective. Above, the sky is predominantly blue with scattered white clouds, indicating partly cloudy conditions. This combination of elements—forest-covered hills, mist, and a blue sky—is consistent with the described background, suggesting a serene, remote natural setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Near the base of the house in Image B, directly beside the banana plant, there is a noticeable cluster of bright orange flowers. These flowers form a dense, vibrant patch that contrasts with the surrounding greenery. They are located close to the path and appear to grow from low shrubs or bushes. Their color and arrangement make them highly visible and distinguishable. This detail matches the description in the question, confirming their presence in the scene.",
