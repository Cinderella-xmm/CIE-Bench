      "question": "Is the long, curly, voluminous white beard present and extending down the front of the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual has a prominent, long, curly white beard that is clearly visible and extends well below the chin, draping over the chest area. The beard's texture appears thick and wavy, consistent with a traditional depiction of Santa Claus or a similar character. This visual cue aligns with common representations of such figures, where the beard is a defining feature. Based on the image, the beard is not only present but also fully developed and positioned as described.",

      "question": "Are the thin-rimmed glasses worn on the face, positioned over the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the individual is wearing spectacles with thin frames. These glasses are positioned directly over the eyes, resting on the nose and ears, which is typical for corrective eyewear. The design and placement match standard human facial anatomy and common usage patterns for glasses. There is no indication that the glasses are misaligned or absent, confirming their presence and correct positioning.",

      "question": "Is the right arm extended outward with the palm facing upward and fingers slightly spread?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the personâ€™s right arm is raised and extended outward from the body. The hand is open, with the palm facing upward and the fingers slightly separated, indicating a waving gesture. This posture is consistent with a friendly or welcoming gesture. The angle of the arm and hand suggests intentional movement, reinforcing the interpretation of an outward extension with an open palm.",

      "question": "Is the mouth curved upward in a smile and the eyes slightly crinkled at the corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial expression in Image B shows the mouth forming a gentle upward curve, indicative of a smile. Additionally, the skin around the outer corners of the eyes appears to be slightly folded or crinkled, a common sign of genuine smiling (known as 'crow's feet'). These features together suggest a positive emotional expression. While the full face is partially obscured by the beard, the visible portions support the conclusion that the person is smiling.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head turned slightly to the left side of the frame, facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The head in Image B is oriented such that the face is mostly directed toward the camera, but there is a subtle turn toward the left side of the frame (from the viewer's perspective). This slight rotation allows both the left and right sides of the face to be partially visible, suggesting a three-quarter view rather than a direct frontal pose. However, the gaze remains forward, maintaining engagement with the viewer. Therefore, the head is indeed turned slightly to the left while still facing forward.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the facial features including the nose, eyebrows, and cheeks clearly visible and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features such as the nose, eyebrows, and cheeks are visible despite the presence of the beard and glasses. The nose is prominent and centrally located, the eyebrows are arched and defined, and the cheeks appear full and natural. These features are consistent with typical human anatomy and do not show signs of distortion or alteration. Although this question refers to consistency with the 'original image' (Image A), comparing both images reveals that the same person is depicted in both, wearing different costumes. The facial structure remains unchanged between the two images, confirming that the features are clearly visible and consistent across both depictions.",

      "question": "Are the fingers of the right hand splayed outward with natural spacing between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right hand in Image B displays five distinct fingers that are spread apart, with noticeable gaps between each digit. The spacing appears natural and anatomically accurate, consistent with a relaxed, open-handed gesture. The hand is positioned in a way that emphasizes the splay of the fingers, which is typical during a wave or greeting. There is no evidence of unnatural compression or overlapping, supporting the conclusion that the fingers are splayed naturally.",
