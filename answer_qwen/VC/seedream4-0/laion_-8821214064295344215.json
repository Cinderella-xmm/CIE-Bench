      "question": "Is there a yellow bow present on the head of the left teddy bear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left teddy bear is clearly visible with a small yellow bow placed on top of its head. The bow is made of mosaic tiles that match the yellow color scheme of the bear's body and clothing. This visual detail aligns with common design patterns in decorative figurines where bows are used as accessories. The bow’s placement and shape are consistent with typical teddy bear styling, especially when aiming for a cute or feminine appearance. Based on the visual evidence, the presence of the yellow bow is unambiguous.",

      "question": "Is there a turquoise ribbon tied around the neck of the right teddy bear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right teddy bear in Image B has a prominent ribbon tied around its neck. The ribbon is made of glossy, reflective mosaic tiles in a turquoise color, matching the bear’s torso and limbs. The style of the ribbon—broad and neatly tied into a bow—is consistent with decorative elements seen in ornamental art pieces. Given the visual clarity and color consistency, it is evident that the ribbon is turquoise and positioned around the neck. This matches typical aesthetic choices in such designs, where contrasting or complementary colors are used for emphasis.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The paws of the left teddy bear in Image B are composed of mosaic tiles arranged in a circular pattern. The dominant color of these tiles is yellow, which matches the bear’s torso and arms. The yellow coloration extends to both the front and back paws, creating a cohesive color theme. This is consistent with the overall design logic where the bear’s lower limbs mirror the upper body’s color scheme. Therefore, based on visual analysis, the paws are indeed yellow.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The paws of the right teddy bear in Image B are constructed from mosaic tiles that are predominantly turquoise in color. These tiles are arranged in a radial pattern, similar to the left bear’s paws, but using the turquoise palette that matches the bear’s torso and arms. The color consistency across the limbs and body suggests intentional design symmetry. Thus, the paws are clearly turquoise, aligning with the bear’s overall color theme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, both teddy bears have small, round, black eyes. These eyes appear to be made of dark-colored mosaic tiles, resembling buttons due to their size, shape, and placement. In traditional teddy bear design, black button eyes are commonly used to give a simple yet expressive look. The uniformity in eye design between the two bears suggests intentional stylistic consistency. Therefore, both bears do have black button-like eyes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both teddy bears feature snouts made of white mosaic tiles, forming a distinct facial area. The nose of each bear is a small, rounded section made of brown tiles, positioned centrally on the snout. This design mirrors real bear anatomy and is a common feature in stylized bear representations. The contrast between the white snout and brown nose enhances facial definition, a standard technique in both plush toys and decorative art. Hence, both bears exhibit this characteristic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both teddy bears are seated in an upright position on a white pedestal. Their bodies are vertical, and their arms are positioned downward along their sides, not raised or crossed. The posture is symmetrical and balanced, typical of display figurines designed to face forward. There is no indication of leaning or movement; the limbs are fixed in place. This posture aligns with conventional presentation styles for collectible or decorative items.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the two teddy bears placed next to each other, with minimal spacing between them, indicating a side-by-side arrangement. Both bears are oriented directly toward the viewer, with their faces and bodies aligned parallel to the camera. This frontal positioning is typical for display purposes, emphasizing symmetry and balance. The composition suggests intentional alignment for aesthetic appeal, reinforcing that they are facing forward.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The heads of both teddy bears in Image B are clearly spherical in shape, constructed from mosaic tiles arranged in a curved pattern to form a round silhouette. Their ears are also rounded, attached symmetrically to the sides of the head, and made of the same tile material. This design reflects the classic teddy bear morphology, where roundness contributes to a soft, approachable appearance. The use of mosaic tiles does not alter the fundamental shape, preserving the intended roundness.",
