      "question": "Does the dress retain the exact geometric pattern of orange-brown diamonds with spiral centers on a turquoise blue background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress appears to be composed of colorful mosaic-like tiles rather than fabric. The pattern is no longer made of orange-brown diamonds with spiral centers on a turquoise blue background; instead, it consists of irregularly shaped, multicolored glass or tile fragments arranged in a patchwork style. This transformation suggests that the original textile pattern has been replaced with an artistic, mosaic-style design. Therefore, the dress does not retain the original geometric pattern.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the beads on the hair arranged in the same repeating sequence of red, white, yellow, and black as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads on the hair are visible but appear to have a different arrangement compared to typical patterns. While some colors like red, white, and yellow are present, the sequence does not consistently repeat in a clear order. Additionally, the beads seem more randomly distributed, and the spacing varies, suggesting a deviation from the original precise sequence. Without seeing Image A, we infer based on common beadwork patterns and visual analysis that this sequence is not strictly maintained.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the braids maintain their upward-coiled crown-like structure originating from the scalp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the braids are still present and originate from the scalp, but they do not exhibit the same upward-coiled crown-like structure seen in traditional styles. Instead, the braids appear more straight and slightly drooping, lacking the defined coiling that would form a crown-like shape. The overall silhouette of the hairstyle has changed, indicating a loss of the original structural detail.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the necklace composed of multiple horizontal layers of beads arranged in concentric rings around the neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the necklace clearly shows multiple horizontal layers of beads stacked closely together, forming a thick, layered collar around the neck. These layers are arranged in concentric fashion, consistent with traditional African beaded necklaces. The color transitions (red, black, green) suggest intentional layering, which aligns with the description of concentric rings. Thus, the structure matches the expected design.",

      "question": "Are there multiple stacked bangles present on both wrists, maintaining the original color sequence and positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both wrists display multiple stacked bangles. However, the colors and sequences differ from what might be expected based on traditional designs or the original image. The bangles include various hues such as white, blue, green, and red, but the exact sequence and alignment do not match typical patterns seen in cultural adornments. Furthermore, the material appears more uniform and less varied, suggesting a stylized or artistic interpretation rather than faithful reproduction.",

      "question": "Are the large circular hoop earrings present in the left earlobe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's left earlobe features a large circular hoop earring. The earring is clearly visible and matches the description of a hoop style. It is positioned correctly within the earlobe and appears consistent with traditional jewelry styles. There is no indication of absence or distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the girl maintain a smiling expression with direct eye contact and a forward-facing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is depicted with a clear smile, her eyes are open and directed toward the viewer, indicating direct eye contact. Her body is oriented straight ahead, facing the camera, which confirms a forward-facing posture. These facial and postural elements are preserved despite the artistic changes in clothing and background.",

      "question": "Does the dress have a sleeveless top and a flared skirt section with vertical pleats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress is sleeveless, which aligns with the description. However, the lower part of the dress does not show vertical pleats. Instead, it appears to be made of mosaic tiles without any visible folds or pleating. The flared skirt section is implied by the shape, but the texture and construction lack the characteristic vertical pleats seen in traditional garments. Therefore, while the sleeveless top is correct, the pleated skirt feature is absent.",
