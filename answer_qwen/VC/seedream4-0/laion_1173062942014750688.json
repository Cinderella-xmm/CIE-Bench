      "question": "Are the blue circular spots present on the serpent’s body, positioned as eyes or eye-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's head clearly displays two prominent blue circular spots that are positioned where eyes would naturally be located. These spots are glossy and reflective, resembling glass or gemstone eyes commonly used in decorative animal representations. Given their placement and appearance, they function as stylized eyes rather than random patterns. This is consistent with artistic depictions of snakes or serpentine figures where eyes are emphasized for visual impact. The positioning and form strongly suggest they are intended to represent eyes.",

      "question": "Do the red and yellow colors form the primary scale patterns along the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the serpent in Image B, the body is predominantly covered in scales that alternate between vibrant red and yellow hues. These colors dominate the visible surface area and are arranged in a repeating pattern across the length of the body. The red and yellow form the base color scheme, with black markings adding contrast. Based on visual analysis, these two colors constitute the primary palette of the serpent’s body, consistent with the typical use of bright, contrasting colors in decorative or symbolic representations of snakes. Thus, red and yellow are indeed the primary scale colors.",

      "question": "Are the black zigzag or spotted patterns visible as tribal markings on the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent in Image B features distinct black patterns that run along its body. These patterns include sharp, angular lines forming zigzag shapes, particularly noticeable along the dorsal side. Additionally, some areas have clustered black spots or dashes, contributing to an overall tribal or geometric aesthetic. These designs resemble traditional ethnic or ceremonial motifs often seen in African or indigenous art. Given their deliberate, non-random arrangement, they can be interpreted as tribal-style markings, enhancing the ornamental nature of the piece.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the segments of the serpent’s body shaped like spheres or near-spheres, reflecting the original bead form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the serpent in Image B appears smooth and continuous, upon closer inspection, the body shows subtle segmentation that suggests it may be composed of joined elements. However, the overall shape is elongated and fluid, not composed of discrete spherical or near-spherical units. The surface is uniformly scaled, lacking the distinct roundness or separation between beads that would indicate individual spherical components. Instead, the form is sculpted into a cohesive, sinuous shape, implying that while the design inspiration may come from beads, the physical construction does not retain the spherical segment form. Therefore, the body does not reflect the original bead form in terms of shape.",

      "question": "Does the surface of the serpent retain a matte, slightly uneven texture resembling hand-painted craftsmanship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the serpent in Image B exhibits a textured appearance with visible scale details and slight variations in color application. The finish is not glossy but has a subdued sheen, suggesting a matte or semi-matte coating. There are minor irregularities in the paint application, such as slight brush strokes and uneven pigment distribution, which are characteristic of hand-painted artwork. These features align with the look of artisanal craftsmanship, where manual techniques introduce subtle imperfections. Hence, the surface texture reflects hand-painted work.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the colors red, yellow, blue, black, and white all present in the serpent’s body, maintaining the original palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent’s body prominently features red and yellow as dominant colors, with black used for patterning. Blue is clearly visible in the eyes and also appears in small accents along the tail, where beads are attached. White is less obvious but can be observed in the lighter areas of the scales, especially where the yellow transitions into cream or off-white tones. While white may not be a primary color, it is present in the texture and highlights. Given that all five colors—red, yellow, blue, black, and white—are identifiable in different parts of the serpent, the original palette is maintained.",

      "question": "Are the patterns on the serpent’s body irregular and varied from segment to segment, matching the original bead diversity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns on the serpent’s body in Image B are not uniform; they vary in density and configuration along the length. While there is a recurring motif of red and yellow with black zigzags, the exact arrangement differs across sections, creating a sense of variation. This mimics the diversity seen in handmade beads, where each piece might have unique markings. However, the overall pattern is more structured than the chaotic variety found in individual beads. Still, the variation is sufficient to reflect the spirit of diverse bead designs, even if not perfectly replicated. Therefore, the patterns do show irregularity and variation consistent with the original bead aesthetic.",
