      "question": "Is the white star with the number \"4\" visible on the turret of the tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turret of the tank is clearly visible. On its side, there is a white star with the number '4' inside it, which is a common military insignia used during World War II by U.S. forces to denote unit identification. This marking is consistent with historical U.S. armored vehicle markings and matches the visual details seen in the image. The star and number are distinctly rendered in white against the green background of the turret, making them easily identifiable. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and world knowledge of military vehicle markings, this feature is present.",

      "question": "Are the markings \"31 64A\" and \"A-14\" visible on the lower sides of the tank’s hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the lower sides of the tank's hull in Image B, the markings '31 64A' and 'A-14' are visible. These markings are located near the front corners of the hull, just above the tracks. The numbers and letters are clearly displayed in a white or light-colored font against the darker green body of the tank. These types of alphanumeric identifiers were commonly used on military vehicles for identification and tracking purposes. In this case, they appear consistent with the style and placement observed on real historical tanks. Thus, based on both visual cues and contextual knowledge about military vehicle identification, these markings are present.",

      "question": "Is the main gun barrel oriented straight forward from the turret?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The main gun barrel in Image B is aligned directly along the longitudinal axis of the tank, pointing straight ahead. This orientation is typical for tanks when displayed in a static position, especially in museum or exhibition settings where the vehicle is presented in a symmetrical, front-facing manner. The barrel extends forward without any noticeable tilt or rotation, indicating that it is aimed straight ahead. This alignment is consistent with how such vehicles are typically displayed to emphasize their frontal profile and design. Therefore, based on visual observation and standard display practices, the gun barrel is oriented straight forward.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sign positioned to the right of the tank is clearly visible. It features bold text that reads 'FUTURE HOME OF THE NATIONAL ARMOR & CAVALRY MUSEUM' in red and black lettering. Below the main title, there is an illustration of a cavalry rider on horseback, which is a symbolic representation of the museum’s focus on cavalry history. Additionally, the website address 'www.armorcavalrymuseum.org' is displayed at the bottom of the sign in smaller black text. All elements are legible and well-defined, with no blurring or obstruction. This information is consistent with promotional signage for museums, and the content matches known branding for the National Armor & Cavalry Museum. Hence, the sign is both visible and legible.",

      "question": "Is there a tiger motif present on the front hull of the tank, located within the blue-and-white checkered area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The front hull of the tank in Image B displays a large graphic within a blue-and-white checkered pattern. At the center of this pattern is a stylized orange tiger with an open mouth showing sharp teeth, red eyes, and black stripes. This design is a classic example of nose art used on military vehicles during wartime, often intended to boost morale and identify units. The tiger motif is clearly constructed using individual colored blocks (consistent with LEGO-style construction), but the overall shape and features are unmistakably those of a roaring tiger. Given the context and visual details, this motif is indeed present and recognizable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank is situated on the left side of the frame, while the museum sign is located to the right. The relative positioning places the tank to the left of the sign when viewed from the camera's perspective. This arrangement is logical for display purposes, as it allows the viewer to see both the vehicle and the informational sign simultaneously. Based on spatial orientation and common exhibit layout principles, the tank is indeed positioned to the left of the museum sign.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tank in Image B is oriented such that its front hull, including the main gun barrel and the tiger motif, is directly aligned with the camera. There is no visible side angle or tilt, and the symmetry of the vehicle suggests it is positioned head-on. The tracks, turret, and hull all appear balanced and centered in the frame, indicating a direct frontal view. This presentation is typical for showcasing military vehicles in exhibitions, where the primary goal is to highlight the front profile. Therefore, based on visual symmetry and display conventions, the tank is facing directly toward the camera.",

      "question": "Does the turret have a distinct cylindrical shape with a dome-like top and a single gun barrel protruding from the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The turret in Image B exhibits a cylindrical form with a rounded, dome-like top, which is characteristic of many mid-20th-century tanks such as the M4 Sherman. A single, long gun barrel extends forward from the center of the turret, consistent with the design of main battle tanks of that era. The structure is clearly defined, with a smooth curvature and a central aperture for the gun. While the tank appears to be made of LEGO bricks, the overall shape and proportions accurately mimic the real-world design. This configuration aligns with historical military engineering and is visually confirmed in the image. Thus, the turret does have the described shape and features.",
