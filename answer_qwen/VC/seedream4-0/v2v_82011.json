      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing doll is depicted in a stylized illustration that mimics the original photograph. The doll's arms are clearly extended outward to the sides, forming a classic ballet pose. This posture is consistent with typical ballet training stances and aligns with the visual cues of balance and form seen in dance instruction imagery. The artistic style preserves the pose despite being rendered in a painted format, indicating intentional retention of the original gesture.",

      "question": "Is the standing doll still wearing a light-colored tutu?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The standing doll in Image B is illustrated wearing a skirt that matches the description of a tutu—light in color, layered, and flared. While the medium has changed from a photograph to an artistic rendering, the visual attributes of the garment remain consistent with the original: it is pale, possibly peach or cream, and structured like a traditional ballet tutu. The use of shading and line work suggests volume and texture typical of such attire, confirming that the light-colored tutu is preserved.",

      "question": "Does the seated doll still wear a pink top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seated doll is shown wearing a long-sleeved top that is distinctly pink in color. Although the illustration uses a more muted palette than the photograph, the hue remains within the pink spectrum. The clothing’s shape and placement match the original, suggesting continuity in design. Artistic interpretation does not alter the fundamental attribute of the top’s color, which is clearly identifiable as pink.",

      "question": "Do both dolls retain their blonde hairstyles, including the braid for the standing doll?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B maintains the hairstyle details observed in the original photo. The standing doll clearly has a braided ponytail, a signature feature of her look, and the seated doll also retains her blonde hair styled in a similar fashion. The artist has preserved these distinguishing characteristics, even though the rendering is stylized. Hair color and styling are accurately represented, ensuring consistency between the two images.",

      "question": "Are both dolls still positioned on the same display table, with one standing and the other seated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both dolls are placed on a single, rectangular display table covered with a pink cloth, just as in the original image. The spatial arrangement is preserved: one doll stands upright on a base, while the other sits beside her. The relative positions and orientation are consistent with the original scene, demonstrating that the composition has been maintained in the artwork despite stylistic changes. The background elements, such as the sign and props, further confirm the setting remains unchanged.",
