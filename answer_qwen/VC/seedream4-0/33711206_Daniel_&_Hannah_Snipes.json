      "question": "Is the woman wearing a rust-colored cardigan over a white top and a long white skirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is depicted in an illustration style that resembles watercolor painting. Her attire consists of a rust-colored outer layer, which appears to be a cardigan or jacket, worn over a white garment. The lower part of her outfit is a long, flowing white skirt that reaches the ground. This visual information aligns with the description of a rust-colored cardigan over a white top and a long white skirt. The style of clothing, while stylized, maintains recognizable elements consistent with the described outfit. Based on the visual cues and common fashion terminology, this conclusion is supported.",

      "question": "Does the child wear a green floral sundress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child is illustrated wearing a dress that is predominantly green with small floral patterns scattered across it. The dress has a sleeveless design and a flared skirt, typical of a sundress. The color and pattern are clearly visible and match the description of a green floral sundress. The artistic rendering, though stylized, preserves enough detail to confirm the presence of floral motifs and the overall green hue. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and understanding of clothing types, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Is there a wooden bench beneath both the woman and the child?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a wooden bench is clearly visible beneath both the woman and the child. The bench is rendered with a natural wood texture and structure, showing two legs and a flat seating surface. Both figures are positioned on the bench—the woman seated and the child standing—indicating that the bench supports both of them. The depiction is consistent with a standard outdoor bench, and its placement under both individuals confirms its role as a shared piece of furniture in the scene. Thus, the visual evidence supports the presence of a wooden bench beneath both figures.",

      "question": "Is there a house with a dormer window visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a house is visible in the background, characterized by a sloped roof and a small window protruding from the upper part of the roofline. This architectural feature is known as a dormer window, which is commonly used to provide light and ventilation in attic spaces. The house also has brickwork and a gabled roof, reinforcing its residential appearance. The dormer window is clearly illustrated, even in the stylized watercolor format. Therefore, based on architectural knowledge and visual confirmation, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Are there orange, purple, and white flowers in the flowerbed behind the bench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, behind the bench, there is a flowerbed containing multiple colored blooms. The illustration shows clusters of flowers in shades of orange, purple, and white. These colors are distinguishable despite the soft, watercolor style, and they are distributed across the flowerbed in a natural arrangement. The presence of these three colors is consistent with the description. Given the clarity of the floral hues and their distribution, it is reasonable to conclude that orange, purple, and white flowers are present in the flowerbed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is shown sitting on the bench with her back slightly angled forward, indicating a seated position. The child, in contrast, is standing on the same bench, with both feet placed on the seat and her body upright. This distinction in posture and positioning is clearly illustrated. The woman's posture suggests she is seated, while the child’s upright stance and foot placement confirm she is standing. Therefore, based on the visual cues and understanding of human postures, the answer is yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the woman and the child have their arms raised and hands extended toward one another. The woman’s right hand is reaching out, and the child’s left hand is reciprocating the gesture. Their hands are close to touching, suggesting an interactive moment. The direction and positioning of their arms and hands are clearly illustrated in the artwork. This mutual extension of hands indicates a shared interaction, consistent with the description. Thus, the visual evidence supports the claim that both are extending their hands toward each other.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground features a patch of green grass, which is clearly illustrated with soft strokes resembling grass blades. Beneath the bench, the ground appears to be composed of small, light-colored stones or pebbles, consistent with gravel. This contrast between the grassy area in front and the gravel under the bench is evident in the image. The artistic style uses different textures and colors to differentiate these surfaces. Based on the visual representation and common landscape design principles, it is accurate to say that grass is in the foreground and gravel is beneath the bench.",
