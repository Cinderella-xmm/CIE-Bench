      "question": "Is the adult character holding an open book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the adult character is clearly depicted holding a glowing object that resembles a book. The object has a rectangular shape with visible pages and is emitting light, suggesting it is open and possibly magical or illuminated from within. Based on visual cues such as the form of the object and its orientation in the character's hands, it appears to be an open book. This conclusion aligns with common representations of books in illustrated scenes, especially when they are central to narrative elements like storytelling or discovery. There is no indication of a closed cover or folded pages that would suggest otherwise.",

      "question": "Are there exactly three children in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three distinct child figures stacked vertically. Each child has unique facial features and positioning, and they are all wearing similar uniforms. The top child is pointing, the middle one is looking at the book, and the bottom one is seated. These three figures are clearly separated and identifiable as individual characters. There are no additional children visible in the background or elsewhere in the scene. Therefore, based on visual count and spatial arrangement, there are exactly three children present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the attire of each child in Image B: the top child wears a blue hat with a yellow ribbon and a blue uniform with yellow trim; the middle child also wears a blue outfit with yellow accents and a matching hat; the bottom child similarly has a blue uniform with yellow trim and a blue hat with a yellow ribbon. All three children share this consistent clothing design, which suggests a uniform style, possibly indicating they are part of a group or organization (e.g., scouts or students). The color scheme and accessories match across all three, confirming uniformity in their attire.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the adult character positioned on the left side of the image, facing the children?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the adult character is located on the left side of the frame, standing upright and facing rightward toward the group of children. Her body orientation and gaze direction clearly indicate she is engaging with the children. This positioning is typical in narrative illustrations where the adult is presenting information or leading an interaction. The children are grouped on the right, forming a visual focus point for the adult’s attention. Thus, both her placement and posture confirm she is on the left and facing the children.",

      "question": "Is one of the children pointing toward the book held by the adult?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the topmost child is extending their right arm with an outstretched finger directed toward the glowing book held by the adult. This gesture is characteristic of pointing and is often used to draw attention to something important. The child's facial expression shows excitement or curiosity, reinforcing the idea that they are actively engaging with the book. No other child is making this specific gesture, so only one child is pointing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom child in Image B is seated on the ground with their legs crossed at the ankles and their hands resting together in front of them in a clasped position. This posture is clearly visible and matches the description provided. The child’s body language suggests attentiveness and calmness, typical of someone listening or observing. The visual details—such as the angle of the legs and the position of the hands—confirm this specific pose.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is not a solid green color. Instead, it features a richly detailed forest scene with various shades of green, blue, and purple foliage, colorful flowers, trees, and ambient lighting effects. There are also elements such as a wooden signpost with handwritten text and arrows, adding narrative depth. The environment is highly textured and layered, indicating a natural woodland setting rather than a plain or monochromatic backdrop. Therefore, the background contains numerous additional elements beyond just green color.",
