    "Question": "Q1: Are the floral and paisley embroidery patterns present and accurately replicated as carved reliefs on the saree?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is a stone sculpture, and the saree is depicted as a carved relief rather than fabric. The patterns on the saree are clearly visible and include intricate designs resembling floral and paisley motifs, which are common in traditional Indian textiles. These patterns are deeply carved into the stone, mimicking the texture and layout of embroidered sarees. The visual depth and repetition of these motifs suggest an accurate replication of the original embroidery style, transformed into a sculptural form. Given that the original image (Image A) features detailed embroidery, the transition to carved reliefs in Image B maintains the essence of the design, albeit in a different medium. Thus, the patterns are present and accurately represented as reliefs.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the saree draped with the pallu over the left shoulder and the pleats aligned vertically at the front?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the saree is draped in a traditional manner. The pallu (the decorative end of the saree) is draped over the left shoulder, which is consistent with conventional Indian saree draping styles. The pleats of the saree are gathered at the front and fall vertically down the body, maintaining symmetry and balance. This aligns with the typical way a saree is worn, especially in formal or ceremonial contexts. Comparing this to Image A, where the same draping style is observed, the consistency in posture and drape confirms that the arrangement is preserved. Therefore, the description matches both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the multi-layered choker necklace positioned around the neck, with dangling elements visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure wears a necklace around the neck that appears to be composed of multiple layers, consistent with traditional Indian jewelry. However, the material is stone, so the 'dangling elements' seen in Image A (such as pendants or chains) are not physically present. Instead, the carving includes raised details that suggest the presence of such elements, but they are not truly dangling due to the rigid nature of the medium. In contrast, Image A shows a metallic, ornate choker with actual dangling components. While the overall shape and layered structure are preserved, the dynamic elements like dangling parts are absent in the sculpture. Thus, while the necklace is present and styled similarly, the dangling elements are not functionally visible.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the bracelet present on the right wrist, matching the design and placement of the original?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a bracelet is visible on the right wrist of the figure. It is carved into the stone and consists of multiple bands, similar in appearance to the bracelet in Image A. The placement is consistent—on the right wrist—and the design, though simplified due to the medium, reflects the layered, ornamental style seen in the original. The positioning and general aesthetic match the original, indicating that the bracelet has been faithfully reproduced in the sculptural form. Despite being a relief rather than wearable jewelry, the intent and placement are preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the ring present on the right hand, specifically on the index finger?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand of the figure is shown with fingers extended, but there is no visible ring on the index finger or any other finger. The carving does not include any small details such as rings, which would be difficult to render in stone at this scale without compromising structural integrity. In contrast, Image A clearly shows a ring on the index finger of the mannequin. Since the sculpture lacks such fine detail, the ring is absent. This omission is likely due to the limitations of the medium and artistic choice, but it is not present in the final form.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the wide, patterned border of the saree preserved along the edges of the pallu and hem?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the saree features a distinct border along the pallu and the hemline. The border is intricately carved with repeating patterns that mirror the design of the main body of the saree. This border is wide and runs consistently along both edges, just as in Image A, where the fabric has a richly decorated border. The transformation from textile to stone has preserved the width and pattern of the border, even if the texture differs. The visual continuity of the border suggests that it was intentionally maintained in the sculpture to reflect the original design. Therefore, the border is preserved in both location and style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Does the figure maintain a standing, upright posture with proportional limbs and a balanced silhouette?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is standing upright with arms positioned naturally at the sides. The limbs are proportionate, and the overall silhouette is balanced and symmetrical. The head is centered, and the body follows a vertical alignment, consistent with classical sculptural representation. The pose mirrors that of Image A, where the mannequin stands straight and poised. Although the figure is made of stone and stylized, the proportions and posture remain faithful to the original, suggesting careful attention to anatomical and aesthetic balance. There are no distortions or imbalances visible, confirming a stable and upright stance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
