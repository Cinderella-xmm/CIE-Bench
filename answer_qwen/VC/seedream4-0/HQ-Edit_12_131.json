      "question": "Is the facial moko kauae tattoo pattern with symmetrical spirals and angular lines clearly visible and intact, covering the forehead, cheeks, and chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior's face displays a detailed and elaborate tattoo pattern consistent with traditional Māori moko kauae. The design includes symmetrical spirals and angular lines that extend across the forehead, down the cheeks, and over the chin. These elements are characteristic of Māori tribal art, where such patterns signify ancestry, status, and identity. The tattoos appear sharp and well-defined, with no visible distortion or gaps. The symmetry is maintained on both sides of the face, and the intricate lines are clearly rendered, indicating high fidelity in the depiction. This aligns with cultural knowledge of moko designs, which emphasize precision and balance. Therefore, based on visual clarity and adherence to known Māori artistic conventions, the tattoo is clearly visible and intact.",

      "question": "Are the intricate moko patterns on the chest, shoulders, and upper arms present with continuous swirling and curved motifs matching the original design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the warrior’s torso and limbs adorned with extensive moko tattoos featuring swirling and curved motifs typical of Māori body art. The patterns on the chest form large, interconnected spirals and curves that flow symmetrically from the pectoral region to the shoulders and upper arms. These designs are continuous and exhibit the same stylistic features seen in authentic Māori moko—such as koru (spirals) and manaia (stylized figures). The continuity of the lines and their integration across anatomical boundaries suggest a deliberate and coherent design. There are no breaks or inconsistencies in the pattern, and the shading enhances the three-dimensionality of the artwork. Given the visual consistency and alignment with traditional Māori tattoo aesthetics, the patterns are accurately and fully represented.",

      "question": "Is the flax piupiu skirt composed of layered, light brown dried flax strands hanging in tiers, secured by a red-brown woven belt with a central metallic buckle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The piupiu skirt in Image B is clearly depicted as being made of layered, light brown dried flax strands arranged in distinct horizontal tiers, which is consistent with traditional Māori attire. The texture of the flax appears fibrous and natural, mimicking the appearance of real dried harakeke (New Zealand flax). The skirt is fastened at the waist by a wide red-brown woven belt, which has a prominent central metallic buckle with decorative elements. This combination of materials and construction matches historical and cultural representations of piupiu worn during haka performances. The belt’s color and structure further support its authenticity as a functional and ceremonial garment. Thus, all described components are present and accurately rendered.",

      "question": "Are thick, shaggy flax leg wraps present on both lower legs, reaching approximately mid-calf and matching the texture of the piupiu skirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both lower legs of the warrior are covered with thick, shaggy leg wraps made of what appears to be dried flax. These wraps extend from just below the knee to around mid-calf, which is typical for traditional Māori leg adornments used in ceremonial dances. The texture of the wraps closely resembles that of the piupiu skirt—coarse, layered, and fibrous—indicating they are made from the same material. The consistency in texture and style reinforces the cultural accuracy of the attire. No discrepancies in material or placement are observed, confirming that the leg wraps are both present and appropriately styled.",

      "question": "Is the warrior positioned in a wide haka stance with knees bent, arms extended outward at shoulder height, and fingers splayed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The warrior in Image B is captured in a dynamic pose characteristic of the haka dance. His legs are spread wide apart with knees bent, creating a stable and powerful base. His arms are extended horizontally at shoulder level, palms facing downward, and fingers are splayed open, enhancing the expressive nature of the gesture. This posture is consistent with traditional haka movements, which emphasize strength, unity, and intimidation. The positioning of the limbs reflects both physical engagement and cultural performance cues. The pose is not static but conveys motion and intensity, aligning with known representations of Māori warriors performing the haka.",

      "question": "Is the background composed of steep, densely vegetated mountain slopes forming a deep valley with visible mist rising between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features dramatic, steep mountain slopes covered in dense green vegetation, indicative of a temperate rainforest environment typical of regions like New Zealand’s South Island. These slopes converge to form a deep valley, and there is a noticeable layer of mist or fog drifting between the peaks, adding depth and atmosphere to the scene. This kind of landscape is commonly associated with Māori cultural settings, particularly in areas such as Fiordland or the Coromandel Peninsula. The lighting and gradient of the terrain suggest elevation changes and moisture-laden air, reinforcing the realism of the setting. Therefore, the background accurately depicts a misty, mountainous valley with rich vegetation.",

      "question": "Is the warrior standing on a large, moss-covered rock in the foreground with visible texture and shadow beneath his feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior is positioned atop a large, dark-colored rock that occupies the foreground. The surface of the rock is visibly textured with patches of green moss, suggesting exposure to damp conditions. Shadows are cast beneath his feet, indicating directional lighting from above and slightly to the side, which adds volume and grounding to the figure. The contrast between the rock’s rough surface and the smooth skin of the warrior enhances the sense of realism. This detail contributes to the immersive quality of the image and supports the naturalistic setting. Thus, the rock is both present and realistically rendered with appropriate texture and shadow.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several tall, green harakeke (New Zealand flax) plants are visible in the foreground, growing around the base of the rock. These plants have long, sword-like leaves with a glossy green appearance, characteristic of Phormium tenax, the species commonly referred to as harakeke. Their placement near the rock enhances the authenticity of the natural environment and ties into Māori cultural symbolism, as harakeke is a sacred plant used in weaving and ceremony. The presence of these plants adds ecological context and visual richness to the scene. Therefore, the harakeke plants are indeed visible and correctly depicted.",
