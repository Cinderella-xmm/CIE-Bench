    "Question": "Q1: Is the radish character’s body still a white oval with a pointed bottom?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the radish character's body is clearly depicted as a white oval shape with a pointed bottom, consistent with the typical appearance of a radish. This form remains unchanged from its natural botanical structure, even though it has been anthropomorphized with limbs and clothing.

Although parts of the sidewalk are covered in snow, the underlying pattern of the tiles remains discernible. The snow accumulates unevenly, leaving portions of the tile edges and grout lines exposed.
