      "question": "Does the edited image retain the figure's iconic screaming posture and facial expression, including the wide-open mouth and hands on ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is clearly depicted with a wide-open mouth, conveying a scream, and both hands are placed over the ears, which is consistent with the iconic pose from Edvard Munch's 'The Scream.' This posture is a defining feature of the original artwork and is preserved here. The facial expression shows exaggerated features—wide eyes and an open mouth—indicative of intense emotional distress. These visual cues align with the well-known representation of existential fear in the original painting. The retention of this specific gesture suggests that the artist intended to maintain the emotional core of the original piece, even as the background was altered. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and understanding of the original artwork’s symbolism, the posture and expression are faithfully maintained.",

      "question": "Is the figure still wearing the blue garment and has the same pale face as in the original painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is dressed in a long, flowing blue garment, which matches the color and style seen in the original 'The Scream' painting. The use of blue dominates the clothing, contributing to the sense of melancholy and alienation often associated with the character. Additionally, the face remains pale, with minimal shading and a yellowish-white tone, consistent with the original depiction. This pale complexion contrasts sharply with the fiery background, emphasizing the figure’s emotional detachment and vulnerability. Comparing to the original (Image A), where the same blue garment and pale face are present, it is evident that these key visual elements have been preserved in the edited version. Thus, despite changes in the environment, the figure’s appearance remains true to the original.",

      "question": "Is the figure positioned on what appears to be the edge of a bridge or platform, similar to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure stands on a structure that resembles a bridge or elevated walkway, indicated by the railing and the perspective leading into the distance. The railing is rendered with diagonal lines and multiple colors, consistent with the original’s architectural framing. The figure leans forward slightly, gripping the railing, which reinforces the impression of being at the edge of a bridge. This positioning mirrors the original painting (Image A), where the figure is also placed on a bridge-like structure overlooking a landscape. The continuity of this spatial arrangement suggests that the setting’s structural integrity has been maintained, even though the background has been dramatically changed. The presence of two distant figures walking along the same path further supports the idea of a shared public space, reinforcing the bridge-like context. Therefore, the figure remains positioned similarly to the original.",

      "question": "Are the figure's limbs and body still depicted using distorted, swirling lines to convey the sense of anxiety and fear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure’s body and limbs are rendered with elongated, wavy, and distorted lines, particularly noticeable in the arms and torso. These lines are not straight or anatomically accurate but instead follow a fluid, almost melting pattern, which enhances the sense of psychological turmoil. This technique is characteristic of Munch’s expressionist style, where form is sacrificed for emotional intensity. The distortion is especially visible in the way the figure’s body seems to blend into the surrounding environment, suggesting instability and inner chaos. When compared to Image A, the original painting uses similar swirling lines to depict the figure’s form, indicating that this stylistic choice has been preserved. The continuation of this expressive line work in the edited version maintains the original’s emotional impact, even amidst a new apocalyptic backdrop. Hence, the use of distorted, swirling lines to convey anxiety and fear is retained.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the expressive, swirled brushstroke style characteristic of the original painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the expressive, swirled brushstroke style that defines Edvard Munch’s original 'The Scream.' The background, particularly the sky and the ground, is composed of dynamic, swirling lines and layered colors, creating a sense of movement and turbulence. Even though the scene has been transformed into a war-torn landscape with explosions and smoke, the artistic technique remains consistent—using thick, overlapping strokes to evoke emotion rather than realism. The figure itself, as well as the bridge and distant elements, are drawn with the same energetic, non-linear approach seen in the original. In comparison to Image A, where the sky is filled with undulating waves of red, orange, and blue, Image B employs a similar method but applies it to a different subject matter—fire and destruction. The continuity in brushwork style indicates that the editor aimed to preserve the expressive quality of the original while recontextualizing the scene. Therefore, the expressive, swirled brushstroke style is indeed retained.",
