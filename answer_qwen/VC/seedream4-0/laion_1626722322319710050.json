      "question": "Is the statue’s right hand raised in a gesture with fingers extended upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is depicted inside a glass dome. Observing the figure's right hand, it appears to be raised and slightly bent at the wrist, with fingers extending upward in a gesture that resembles a blessing or pointing motion. This posture is consistent with classical religious statues, where such gestures are common for figures like saints or prophets. The lighting reflects off the metallic surface, emphasizing the shape of the hand and fingers. Based on visual cues and common iconographic conventions, the hand is indeed raised with fingers extended upward.",

      "question": "Does the statue have a visible beard and long hair on the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue in Image B shows a male figure with facial features clearly defined despite the reflective metallic surface. A full beard is visible, extending from the chin down the neck, which is typical of depictions of biblical figures such as apostles or prophets. Additionally, the hair is styled in long, wavy locks that fall over the ears and back of the head. These features are consistent with traditional representations of such figures in religious art. The reflective material enhances the contours, making both the beard and hair distinct.",

      "question": "Are there clearly visible folds and drapes in the robe covering the statue’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robe worn by the statue in Image B exhibits pronounced folds and drapery, especially around the arms, chest, and lower body. The metallic surface reflects light in a way that accentuates the depth and texture of these folds, suggesting careful sculptural detail. The fabric appears to flow naturally, with creases and overlapping layers that mimic real cloth. This level of detail is typical in classical statuary, where robes are used to convey movement and dignity. The reflections and shadows further confirm the presence of complex draping.",

      "question": "Is the year “1882” visibly inscribed on the front face of the pedestal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pedestal is made of white marble and features several plaques, but the year '1882' is not visible on the front face. Instead, multiple inscriptions are present, including gold-lettered plaques with text in what appears to be Latin or French, but no clear indication of '1882' can be seen. In contrast, Image A (the original) shows '1882' inscribed on the left side of the pedestal. However, since this question focuses only on Image B, and the year is not visible there, the answer must reflect that it is absent in this version.",

      "question": "Is there a dark rectangular plaque affixed to the lower front section of the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the pedestal includes several plaques, one of which is dark and rectangular, located centrally on the lower front section. This plaque has gold lettering and appears to contain an inscription, possibly dedicatory or commemorative. While the text is not legible, its shape and placement match the description of a dark rectangular plaque. The surrounding area is clean and well-defined, confirming its presence. This contrasts with Image A, where only one small dark plaque is present, but in Image B, multiple plaques are visible, including the specified one.",

      "question": "Is the statue positioned directly on top of the pedestal, aligned vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is placed centrally atop the pedestal, with its vertical axis aligned with the central axis of the base. The structure beneath the statue (a smaller platform within the glass dome) is also centered, ensuring perfect vertical alignment. The symmetry of the composition, along with the reflection in the glass dome, confirms that the statue is not tilted or offset. This alignment is consistent with standard monument design, where balance and stability are emphasized. There is no visual evidence of misalignment, even though the added glass dome and internal landscaping introduce new elements.",
