    "Question": "Q1: Are the plant's large, vibrant green leaves with their natural shape and arrangement retained in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the plant displays a cluster of large, broad leaves that are uniformly green with visible veins, characteristic of healthy foliage. The leaves are arranged in a natural, slightly asymmetrical pattern typical of many houseplants like the pothos or philodendron. Their shape—oval with pointed tips—and the way they fan out from the central stem appear consistent with natural growth patterns. There is no distortion, unnatural curvature, or artificial repetition that would suggest digital manipulation. The lighting enhances the texture and color variation across the leaves, further reinforcing their realistic appearance. Based on visual cues and common knowledge about plant morphology, the leaves retain their natural form and arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the plant still positioned on the windowsill in the same manner as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the plant placed directly on the white windowsill, centered relative to the window frame. Its position appears identical to how it was in Image A, with the pot resting firmly on its saucer and aligned along the edge of the sill. The angle of sunlight hitting the plant and casting shadows suggests the same spatial orientation. No shift in placement, rotation, or elevation is evident. The background elements (window frame, wall, and light direction) remain consistent, supporting the conclusion that the plant’s positioning has not changed. This consistency aligns with typical photographic composition where objects are kept static unless intentionally moved.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the terracotta pot and saucer beneath the plant intact and unchanged?",
    "explanation": "The terracotta pot in Image B is cylindrical, with a smooth surface and a warm brown tone typical of ceramic pots. It sits atop a matching saucer, which holds any excess water. Both items show no signs of damage, warping, or alteration. Their shapes, proportions, and placement relative to the plant are consistent with what would be expected in a real-world setting. Comparing this to Image A, there is no visible difference in material, color, or structure. The lighting highlights subtle reflections and shadows that confirm the physical integrity of both objects. Therefore, based on visual inspection and understanding of common household items, the pot and saucer remain intact and unchanged.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the soft sunlight and its interaction with the plant and windowsill preserved as in the original?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, soft sunlight streams through the window from the right side, illuminating parts of the plant and casting gentle shadows on the windowsill. The light creates a gradient effect on the leaves, highlighting their edges and giving them a luminous quality. This type of directional lighting is consistent with morning or late afternoon sun, which is known for producing soft, diffused illumination. The shadows are sharp yet not harsh, indicating a natural light source without artificial enhancement. When compared to Image A, the angle, intensity, and distribution of light appear nearly identical, suggesting that the lighting conditions have been preserved. There are no indications of added filters or altered exposure that would change the nature of the sunlight interaction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the blurred greenery visible through the window still present and unchanged?",
    "explanation": "Through the window in Image B, a softly blurred background of green tones is visible, indicative of outdoor foliage such as trees or bushes. The bokeh effect suggests a shallow depth of field, commonly used in photography to emphasize the foreground subject. While the details are indistinct due to the blur, the overall color palette and composition of the greenery remain consistent with what is seen in Image A. There is no evidence of new elements, shifts in perspective, or changes in lighting that would suggest the scene outside has been altered. Given that the window framing and light conditions are unchanged, it is reasonable to conclude that the external view remains the same, albeit naturally obscured by focus and distance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
