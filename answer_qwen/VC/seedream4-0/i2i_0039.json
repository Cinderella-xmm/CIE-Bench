      "question": "Is the adult polar bear positioned behind the two cubs, with the cubs visibly interacting with each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the adult polar bear is standing slightly behind and to the side of the two cubs. The positioning shows the adult bear facing forward while the cubs are grouped closely together, with one cub appearing to nuzzle or interact with the other. This interaction is visible as their heads are close and oriented toward each other, suggesting social behavior typical of young polar bears. Based on visual cues such as body orientation and proximity, it is clear that the cubs are engaging with one another, while the adult remains in a protective, rearward position. This arrangement aligns with natural maternal behavior observed in polar bears, where mothers often stand guard while cubs play or bond.",

      "question": "Are the detailed textures of the ice and snow, including ridges and smooth patches, still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays the surface of the ice floe with visible textural variations. There are distinct ridges formed by pressure and melting, as well as smoother areas likely created by wind or water refreezing. These features are consistent with natural glacial ice formations in Arctic environments. The lighting enhances these details, making the undulating topography evident. Comparing this to typical high-resolution wildlife photography, the texture preservation indicates no significant loss of detail due to editing. Thus, the intricate surface patterns remain intact.",

      "question": "Is the ocean backdrop visible behind the ice floe, showing the dark blue water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B prominently features a deep blue ocean extending beyond the edge of the ice floe. The water appears calm but textured with small ripples, indicating natural surface movement. The contrast between the white ice and the dark blue water is strong, emphasizing the isolation of the ice floe. This visual element is crucial for conveying the Arctic setting and supports the environmental message of the image. Given the clarity and color consistency, the ocean backdrop is clearly visible and accurately represented.",

      "question": "Are the natural lighting and shadow effects on the polar bears and ice preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears consistent with natural daylight conditions in the Arctic. Shadows cast by the polar bears are soft and directional, suggesting a sun angle typical of midday in polar regions. The highlights on the bears' fur and the reflective quality of the snow indicate realistic illumination. Furthermore, the shadows on the ice surface match the contours and elevation changes, reinforcing the authenticity of the lighting. No signs of over-processing or artificial light manipulation are evident. Therefore, the natural lighting and shadow effects have been preserved.",

      "question": "Do the polar bears retain their distinct white fur coloration, with no significant alteration to their iconic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The polar bears in Image B exhibit their characteristic white fur, which blends naturally with the snowy environment. While slight yellowing may be present due to age or diet (common in wild polar bears), the overall coloration remains true to life. There is no evidence of unnatural color grading, tinting, or digital enhancement that would distort their appearance. Their physical features—such as facial structure, fur texture, and body proportions—are consistent with real polar bears. This fidelity supports the image's purpose as a realistic representation of wildlife in a natural habitat.",
