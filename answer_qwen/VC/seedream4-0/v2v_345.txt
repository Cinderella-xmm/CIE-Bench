    "Question": "Q1: Is the USB-C port located centrally on the bottom edge of the smartphone, flanked by two sets of three circular speaker holes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom edge of the smartphone is visible, and it features a central USB-C port. On either side of this port, there are symmetrical arrangements of small circular openings, which resemble speaker grilles. Each set consists of three circular holes, consistent with typical smartphone speaker designs. The layout matches common smartphone configurations where the charging port is centered and speakers are placed symmetrically on both sides. This design is standard in many modern smartphones to balance audio output and maintain symmetry. Based on visual inspection and general knowledge of smartphone hardware design, the arrangement is accurate.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the smartphone placed diagonally on the wooden surface, with its bottom edge closer to the viewer than the top edge?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the smartphone is positioned such that its bottom edge appears closer to the viewer compared to its top edge. This diagonal orientation is evident from the perspective of the phone's edges and how they recede into the background. The angle of the device relative to the camera creates a foreshortened view, indicating that the phone is not aligned parallel to the viewer but instead angled slightly. This placement is common in product photography to add depth and interest. Based on visual cues like edge alignment and perspective distortion, the phone is indeed placed diagonally.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the wooden surface display a consistent horizontal grain pattern with warm brown tones and visible wood fibers?",
    "explanation": "The wooden surface in Image B shows a clear horizontal grain pattern running across the frame. The coloration is warm, ranging from light to medium brown, characteristic of natural wood finishes. Fine lines and textures indicative of wood fibers are visible, especially under the lighting conditions. These features are consistent with real wood surfaces commonly used for tabletops or desks. The texture and color suggest a polished or laminated wood surface, but the overall appearance aligns with realistic wood grain patterns. Therefore, based on visual details and world knowledge of wood textures, the description holds true.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the background a uniform beige color with a soft blur effect, providing a shallow depth of field?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the mouse and smartphone is out of focus, creating a soft blur effect. The color is a consistent, neutral beige tone without any distinct patterns or variations. This blurring suggests a shallow depth of field, which is often used in photography to emphasize the foreground subjects (the mouse and phone). The uniformity of the color and lack of sharp detail confirm that the background has been intentionally blurred to draw attention to the main objects. This technique is common in macro or product photography. Thus, based on visual evidence and photographic principles, the background meets the described criteria.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the mouse positioned to the left of the smartphone, with both objects resting on the same wooden surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pixel-art-style mouse is clearly situated to the left of the smartphone when viewed from the front. Both the mouse and the smartphone are placed directly on the same wooden surface, as indicated by their shared base and consistent shadowing and lighting. There is no elevation difference or separation between them, confirming they rest on the same plane. This positioning is logical for a comparative or thematic setup, such as highlighting size or design contrast. Therefore, based on spatial relationships and object placement, the answer is affirmative.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the mouse oriented such that its head is turned toward the smartphone?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pixel-art mouse is facing rightward, with its head directed toward the smartphone. The positioning of the ears, eyes, and nose all point in the direction of the phone, indicating intentional orientation. This is consistent with the way animals or figures are often depicted in images to suggest interaction or curiosity. The design of the mouseâ€™s face, including the placement of the whiskers and eyes, supports this forward-facing orientation. Given the visual cues and common artistic conventions for depicting attention or focus, the mouse is indeed oriented toward the smartphone.",
    "answer": "Yes"
