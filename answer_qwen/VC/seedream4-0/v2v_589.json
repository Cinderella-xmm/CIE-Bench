      "question": "Does the image retain the vibrant lime-green color for the nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B are uniformly painted in a bright, vibrant lime-green color. This color is consistent across all six dolls, matching the hue seen in the original soccer cleat and tennis ball from Image A. The choice of lime-green is deliberate and visually prominent, suggesting an intentional design decision to maintain a cohesive color theme. Based on visual inspection and common knowledge about color consistency in themed designs, the lime-green color is clearly retained.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls retain the textured surface resembling the cleat's material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the nesting dolls in Image B appears smooth and glossy, with no visible texture that resembles the synthetic or leather-like material of the soccer cleat in Image A. The cleat has a fine, slightly grainy texture typical of athletic footwear materials, which is absent in the dolls. Instead, the dolls have a painted, flat finish with decorative patterns. Therefore, the textured surface of the cleat is not preserved in the nesting dolls.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls incorporate the fuzzy texture and white seam of the tennis ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tennis ball in Image A has a distinct fuzzy felt surface and a white curved seam, characteristic of standard tennis balls. In contrast, the nesting dolls in Image B are smooth and lack any fuzzy texture. Additionally, there is no white seam present on the dolls; instead, they feature painted floral designs and facial features. The absence of both the fuzzy texture and the seam indicates that these specific characteristics of the tennis ball have not been incorporated into the dolls.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls reflect the elongated shape of the soccer cleat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The soccer cleat in Image A has a long, narrow, and pointed shape typical of athletic footwear designed for performance. In contrast, the nesting dolls in Image B are rounded and bulbous, following the traditional Matryoshka doll form. While the dolls are arranged in descending size order like the cleat might be scaled, their overall silhouette is not elongated. Instead, they are more cylindrical and rounded, which diverges significantly from the cleatâ€™s shape. Thus, the elongated shape of the cleat is not reflected in the dolls.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tennis ball in Image A is spherical, with a perfectly round shape. The nesting dolls in Image B, while rounded at the top and bottom, are not spherical. They have a more oval or cylindrical form with a defined head and body section, which deviates from the uniform curvature of a sphere. Although the dolls are somewhat rounded, they do not fully replicate the three-dimensional spherical geometry of the tennis ball. Therefore, the rounded shape of the tennis ball is not accurately incorporated.",
