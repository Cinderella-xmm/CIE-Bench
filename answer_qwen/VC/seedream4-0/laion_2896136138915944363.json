      "question": "Does the stylized illustration retain the scalloped pattern on the wings and back, with alternating dark and light feather edges forming a scale-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's wing and back feathers are depicted with a detailed pattern that includes alternating dark and light edges, creating a visual effect resembling scales. This scalloped or fish-scale-like texture is characteristic of many shorebird illustrations, particularly in naturalist art styles. The pattern is consistent across the upper body and wings, suggesting careful attention to realistic feather structure. Given the artistic style and the level of detail visible, it is evident that the illustrator intended to preserve this textured appearance. Comparing this to typical ornithological illustrations, such patterns are often used to represent the complex layering of feathers. Therefore, the scalloped pattern is indeed retained.",

      "question": "Is the breast and throat area rendered in a consistent peach-orange hue, distinct from the darker upper body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B shows the bird’s breast and throat region in a warm, uniform peach-orange color. This coloration contrasts clearly with the darker, mottled brown and black tones of the back and wings. This distinction is typical of many shorebird species, such as the Red Knot, where the underparts are lighter and more uniformly colored than the upper parts. The consistency in tone across the breast and throat suggests intentional artistic rendering to highlight this contrast. Thus, the color differentiation is both accurate and visually apparent.",

      "question": "Is the beak long, straight, and uniformly black, extending from the face without curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beak in Image B is depicted as long and straight, with a smooth, unbroken line from the base to the tip. It is uniformly black, with no visible gradations or color changes. There is no noticeable curvature, which aligns with the morphology of certain sandpipers or similar shorebirds. The absence of any bend or hook reinforces the idea of a straight beak, suitable for probing sand or mud. This feature matches known anatomical traits of such birds, supporting the conclusion that the beak is indeed long, straight, and uniformly black.",

      "question": "Is there a clearly defined dark eye positioned near the center of the head, surrounded by lighter skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird has a prominent dark eye located approximately at the midpoint of the head, slightly forward. The surrounding area of the head is rendered in a lighter, pale tone, creating a clear contrast that highlights the eye. This positioning and contrast are typical in bird illustrations to emphasize visibility and facial features. The eye appears well-defined, not blurred or indistinct, and its placement relative to the beak and crown aligns with natural anatomy. Hence, the eye is clearly defined and set against lighter skin.",

      "question": "Are the legs dark gray-black and do they end in three forward-facing toes with visible claws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The legs in Image B are illustrated in a dark gray-black shade, consistent with the plumage of many shorebirds. Each leg ends in three toes that point forward, with small, sharp claws visible at the tips. This configuration is typical of wading birds, which require strong, clawed feet for grip on soft substrates like sand or mud. The depiction of three toes with claws matches biological accuracy and common artistic representation in ornithological illustrations. Therefore, the legs and feet are accurately portrayed.",

      "question": "Is the bird depicted in a standing posture, with legs fully extended and body upright, as if on a shoreline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B is shown standing on a surface that resembles a sandy shoreline, with its legs fully extended and body held upright. This posture is typical of shorebirds when resting or observing their surroundings. The alignment of the legs and the orientation of the body suggest balance and stability, consistent with a standing position. Additionally, the background elements (like water and beach grass) reinforce the context of a shoreline habitat. Thus, the bird is clearly depicted in a standing, upright posture appropriate for its environment.",

      "question": "Are there small tufts of beach grass and scattered pebbles visible in the foreground beneath the bird’s feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the bird’s feet, there are small tufts of grass-like vegetation and a few scattered pebble-like shapes drawn in muted tones. These elements are consistent with a natural shoreline setting. While the details are somewhat stylized, the presence of grass and pebbles is clearly indicated in the foreground, contributing to the environmental context. This aligns with typical illustrations that include habitat cues to enhance realism. Therefore, these features are present and identifiable.",

      "question": "Is there a clear transition from the warm peach-orange underparts to the darker, mottled upper body and wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a distinct color gradient between the bird’s underparts and upper body. The chest and belly are rendered in a warm peach-orange tone, while the back, wings, and head gradually shift into darker, mottled patterns of brown and black. This transition is smooth but clearly demarcated, emphasizing the contrast between the two regions. Such a division is common in shorebird anatomy, where the underside is lighter for camouflage against the sky, and the upper side is darker for concealment against the ground. The artistic rendering successfully captures this natural dichotomy.",
