      "question": "Is the dragon embroidery clearly visible on the left side of the chest, with detailed scales and a raised texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is wearing an ornate traditional Chinese robe, likely a Qing dynasty-style imperial garment. On the left side of the chest (from the viewer's perspective), there is a prominent golden dragon embroidered in intricate detail. The embroidery features clearly defined scales, flowing mane, and a three-dimensional appearance that suggests raised texture, typical of high-quality silk brocade work used in historical imperial attire. The use of gold thread and layered stitching enhances the depth and realism of the dragon motif. This level of detail aligns with traditional Chinese textile craftsmanship, where dragons symbolize power and royalty. The visibility and texture are consistent with such artistic techniques.",

      "question": "Are the peony and vine floral patterns visible along the right side of the dress, matching the original arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right side of the dress (from the viewer’s perspective) displays richly embroidered floral motifs. Peonies—often considered the 'king of flowers' in Chinese culture—are present alongside vine-like foliage, arranged in a flowing, symmetrical pattern typical of traditional Chinese textiles. These elements are consistent with classical designs seen in imperial garments, where floral patterns symbolize prosperity and beauty. However, since Image A (the original) is not explicitly described as having a specific arrangement of these patterns, we must assess based on Image B alone. The floral design appears balanced and stylistically coherent with the rest of the garment. While the exact match to an 'original' arrangement cannot be confirmed without direct comparison, the presence and style of the peony and vine patterns are clearly visible and well-integrated into the overall design.",

      "question": "Does the subject retain her original facial features, including the shape of the eyes, nose, and lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features of the subject in Image B—including the almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and full lips—are consistent with those seen in Image A. Both images depict the same individual with similar proportions and symmetry. The skin tone, makeup style (e.g., defined eyebrows, subtle blush, red lipstick), and overall facial structure remain unchanged. This continuity suggests that the edit preserved the original facial identity, even though the hairstyle and clothing have been altered significantly. The consistency in facial features across both images supports the conclusion that no significant morphing or transformation has occurred to the face.",

      "question": "Are the hands positioned together in front of the waist, fingers interlaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s hands are placed in front of her waist, with fingers gently interlaced. The positioning is formal and poised, characteristic of traditional Chinese portraiture or ceremonial poses. The hands rest naturally, with the thumbs overlapping and fingers aligned, suggesting a deliberate and composed stance. This posture is common in depictions of noblewomen or imperial figures, reinforcing the cultural context of the attire. There is no indication of awkwardness or misalignment; the pose appears balanced and intentional.",

      "question": "Is the red silk fabric visibly textured with a reflective sheen, showing fine weave details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red fabric in Image B exhibits a glossy, reflective surface indicative of high-quality silk. Light reflects off the material in a way that highlights its smoothness and fine weave, which is characteristic of satin or brocade fabrics used in traditional Chinese garments. The texture appears slightly raised in areas due to the embroidery, but the underlying fabric itself shows a consistent luster and tight weave pattern. This sheen is consistent with authentic silk textiles, especially those used for ceremonial or imperial wear. The lighting in the image enhances this effect, making the weave details discernible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s posture is upright yet relaxed, with shoulders evenly aligned and a slight natural curve in the spine. The silhouette is proportionate, with no signs of distortion or exaggeration. The arms hang naturally, and the torso maintains a balanced, anatomically correct form. This posture is consistent with human anatomy and contrasts with any potential AI-generated distortions that might otherwise appear in stylized or exaggerated forms. Comparing to Image A (which shows a similar figure), the body proportions remain consistent—neither elongated nor compressed. Thus, the subject retains natural and realistic body proportions.",
