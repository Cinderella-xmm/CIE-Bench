      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Jesus Christ is positioned at the center of the table, which aligns with the traditional composition of Leonardo da Vinci's 'The Last Supper.' His hands are raised slightly, with one hand open and the other gesturing outward, conveying a calm and composed demeanor. This posture is consistent with the original painting's depiction of Jesus as serene and central to the scene. The visual cues—such as his placement directly in the middle, the symmetry of the composition around him, and the direction of the apostles' gazes—support this interpretation. There is no distortion or alteration to his position or gesture that would suggest otherwise. Thus, based on both visual analysis and knowledge of the original artwork, Jesus remains centrally seated with a calm gesture.",

      "question": "Are the apostles positioned around the table displaying varied emotions and gestures characteristic of their interactions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apostles are arranged in groups of three on either side of Jesus, each group reacting differently to the moment. Their expressions and body language vary significantly—some appear shocked, others are leaning forward in conversation, and a few are gesturing toward one another. These reactions reflect the emotional intensity of the moment when Jesus announces that one of them will betray him. This variety in emotion and gesture is a hallmark of Leonardo’s original work, where each apostle is depicted with distinct personality and response. In Image B, these details remain intact; there is no visible alteration to their postures or facial expressions. Therefore, the apostles still display the characteristic emotional diversity seen in the original painting.",

      "question": "Is the background featuring windows with a view of distant mountains and symmetrical wall panels still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes three arched windows behind the figures, through which a landscape with distant mountains and sky is visible. This matches the architectural style and scenic backdrop of the original fresco. Additionally, the walls on both sides of the room feature symmetrical vertical panels, which are part of the Renaissance-style interior design depicted in the original. These elements remain unaltered in Image B, maintaining the spatial depth and perspective that Leonardo used. No changes to the windows or wall panels are evident, so the background retains its original features.",

      "question": "Is the table covered with a white cloth and populated with bread, dishes, and drinks as depicted in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the long table is draped with a white cloth, consistent with the original painting. On the table, various items such as loaves of bread, plates, and cups are visible, arranged in a manner typical of the Last Supper scene. These objects are placed in front of each figure, matching the original composition where food and drink are central to the narrative. While some minor details may be obscured due to image resolution or editing, the overall presence and arrangement of these items remain faithful to the original. There is no indication that the table setting has been removed or altered in any significant way.",

      "question": "Has a modern man in formal attire been added on the far-right empty space, raising a glass without altering the rest of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a man dressed in a modern black tuxedo with a bow tie is standing on the far right side of the frame, outside the original painted scene. He is holding up a wine glass in a toast-like gesture, clearly not part of the original fresco. This figure is superimposed into the image, occupying what was originally an empty space near the edge of the wall. Importantly, the rest of the painting—including the figures, table, background, and architecture—remains unchanged. The addition of this man does not distort or alter the original composition but rather overlays it in a digitally inserted manner. This indicates a deliberate edit to juxtapose a contemporary figure with the historical artwork.",
