      "question": "Is the number 18 present on the rear wing of the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rear wing of the sprint car is clearly visible. The number '18' is prominently displayed in large, bold white numerals with a black outline on the upper right portion of the wing. This is consistent with typical sprint car design where the race number is placed for high visibility. The stylized presentation and placement match standard racing conventions. Based on visual cues, the number is unmistakably present.",

      "question": "Is the \"Bobcat\" logo visible on the top wing of the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top surface of the wing features several sponsor logos. Among them, the word 'Bobcat' is clearly legible in a distinct font, positioned centrally beneath the 'TEAM' text. The logo's style and placement are consistent with branding seen on real-world sprint cars. The presence of this logo aligns with known sponsorship patterns in motorsports, where equipment brands like Bobcat (a construction machinery company) often appear on racing vehicles. Therefore, the 'Bobcat' logo is indeed visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leading edge of the top wing displays the text 'AMERICAN EXPRESS' in a bold, capitalized font running horizontally. The text is oriented to be readable from the front and side angles, which is typical for prominent sponsors. The stylization matches American Express's branding, including the color scheme and lettering. Given that American Express is a well-known sponsor in various sports, its presence here is plausible and visually confirmed in the image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side panel of the car, just below the cockpit and near the rear wheel, shows a rectangular decal with the words 'ROYAL FLOORING' in white text on an orange background. This decal is clearly outlined and positioned in a location typical for sponsor decals on sprint cars. The font and layout are consistent with real-world examples of such branding. Thus, based on visual evidence and common placement practices, the decal is visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cockpit area shows a figure seated inside the car. The head is covered by a helmet, which is characteristic of race car drivers for safety. The helmet appears to have a visor and is colored in a way consistent with professional racing gear. Although stylized due to the comic art style, the silhouette and positioning confirm the presence of a driver wearing a helmet. This aligns with standard safety regulations in sprint car racing.",

      "question": "Is the high wing with its angular shape present above the cockpit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large, angular wing structure is clearly depicted above the cockpit. It has a sharp, geometric shape with multiple panels and is mounted high on the carâ€™s chassis, which is typical of sprint cars designed for aerodynamic downforce. The wing extends over the driver and is supported by struts, matching the structural design of real sprint cars. The comic style exaggerates the lines but preserves the essential form and function of the high wing.",

      "question": "Does the car retain the low-profile sprint car silhouette with wide rear tires and narrow front tires?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall silhouette of the vehicle matches that of a traditional sprint car. The body is low to the ground, with a compact frame and exposed suspension. The rear tires are visibly wider than the front tires, a hallmark of sprint car design that provides better traction. The front tires are narrower and positioned closer together, consistent with the handling requirements of dirt track racing. Despite the stylized comic rendering, these proportions and features are preserved, confirming the car retains the classic sprint car profile.",
