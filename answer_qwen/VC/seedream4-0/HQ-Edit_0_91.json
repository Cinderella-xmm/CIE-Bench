      "question": "Is the circular golden medallion located at the center of the floral panel on the chest still present and positioned in the same place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central floral panel on the chest features a prominent circular golden medallion, which is clearly visible and centrally located. The medallion appears to be ornate with intricate designs, consistent with traditional Korean hanbok embellishments. Based on visual analysis, the position and presence of this medallion match the original placement seen in Image A. The surrounding floral patterns are symmetrically arranged around it, reinforcing its central role in the design. There is no indication of displacement or omission. Thus, the medallion remains both present and correctly positioned.",

      "question": "Are the multicolored floral patterns (including red, blue, yellow, and white flowers) visible on the sleeves and shoulders of the robe, maintaining their original positions and compositions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sleeves and shoulders of the robe display vibrant, multicolored floral patterns that include red, blue, yellow, and white flowers. These patterns are richly detailed and follow a symmetrical composition typical of traditional Korean attire. The arrangement matches the original layout observed in Image A, where the floral motifs extend from the shoulder down the sleeve, with gold accents adding depth. The colors and placements appear consistent, indicating that the design has been preserved without significant alteration. Therefore, the patterns maintain their original positions and compositions.",

      "question": "Is the white hair parted on the left side and swept back neatly from the forehead, forming a clear division down the middle of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characterâ€™s white hair is styled with a distinct parting line running vertically down the center of the head, dividing the hair into two symmetrical sections. The hair is swept back neatly from the forehead, creating a clean and orderly appearance. This style aligns with traditional depictions of elder figures in formal attire, where grooming reflects dignity and formality. While the parting is centered rather than on the left side as might be inferred from some cultural styles, the visual evidence shows a central division. Hence, the description of 'parted on the left' does not match the actual visual; instead, it is centered. Therefore, the statement is inaccurate.",

      "question": "Are the hands positioned in front of the body with fingers interlocked and palms touching, maintaining the original clasp orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are positioned in front of the body, with fingers interlocked and palms pressed together. The right hand rests over the left, which is a common gesture in formal portraits, symbolizing respect and composure. This pose mirrors the hand positioning in Image A, where the hands are similarly clasped in a dignified manner. The orientation and alignment of the fingers and palms remain consistent between both images, suggesting that the clasp has been preserved accurately. No rotation or inversion is evident, confirming the retention of the original clasp orientation.",

      "question": "Does the collar retain the V-shape with blue outer trim, maroon inner binding, and a visible white inner lining at the neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collar of the robe exhibits a clear V-shape, characteristic of traditional Korean hanbok. The outer edge of the collar is trimmed in blue, while the inner binding is maroon, creating a layered effect. Beneath these, a white inner lining is visible at the neck, providing contrast and completing the traditional design. This configuration matches exactly what is seen in Image A, where the same color scheme and structural elements are present. The preservation of these details indicates faithful reproduction of the collar's design.",

      "question": "Do the sleeves maintain their original wide, flowing shape extending to the wrists without significant narrowing or shortening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sleeves are depicted as wide and flowing, extending fully to the wrists. They maintain the traditional silhouette of a hanbok sleeve, which is broad and drapes elegantly. There is no visible narrowing or shortening compared to the original image. The fabric appears to hang naturally, preserving the full length and width. This consistency with Image A confirms that the sleeve proportions have been accurately maintained in the edited version.",

      "question": "Is the original beige textured background with subtle reddish-brown smudges still visible behind the figure, especially around the upper shoulders and sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is not the same as in Image A. Instead of a beige textured backdrop with reddish-brown smudges, Image B features a clean, off-white rectangular frame set against a solid dark blue border. The background includes faint botanical illustrations along the edges, which are not present in the original. Therefore, the original textured background with smudges is absent. This change suggests a stylistic reimagining, likely for aesthetic or thematic purposes, but it deviates from the original setting.",
