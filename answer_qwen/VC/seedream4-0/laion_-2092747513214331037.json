      "question": "Is the cyclist in a forward-leaning position with hands on aerobars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cyclist is clearly depicted in a highly aerodynamic posture, leaning forward with their hands positioned on what appear to be aerobars—extensions of the handlebars designed for time trials. The rider's body is close to the bike frame, minimizing wind resistance, which is typical in time trial cycling. This posture is consistent with competitive time trial riding techniques. The visual cues such as the angle of the torso, arm placement, and overall body alignment confirm that the cyclist is using aerobars. Based on world knowledge, aerobars are standard equipment in time trials to improve aerodynamics, and the rider’s form matches this expectation.",

      "question": "Are two bicycles mounted vertically on the roof rack of the black car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof rack of the black car appears to have a single bicycle mounted on it, positioned vertically. While the structure of the rack suggests it could hold more than one bike, only one bicycle is visibly secured. The second bike seen in Image A (the original) is not present here. The absence of a second bike is clear from the visual evidence in Image B. Therefore, based on the current image, the answer must reflect what is actually shown, not what might be inferred from another version.",

      "question": "Are there white lane markings and a yellow center line on the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road features distinct white lane markings along the edges and a solid yellow line running down the center, separating the opposing directions of traffic. These markings are clearly visible and consistent with standard road design in many regions, particularly in areas where highways or open roads are used for cycling events. The presence of both white and yellow lines supports the conclusion that the road is properly marked for vehicular traffic, including cyclists during organized events. The visual clarity of these lines allows for confident identification.",

      "question": "Is there an orange traffic cone visible in the background near the cyclist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible orange traffic cone in the background near the cyclist. The area behind the cyclist appears clear, with only the road, distant hills, and part of the sky visible. In contrast, Image A does show an orange cone, but in Image B, it has been removed or digitally altered. This change is evident when comparing the two images, and the absence of the cone in Image B is confirmed by direct observation. The editing process likely removed the cone to enhance focus on the futuristic elements introduced in the edited version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the license plate on the front of the black car is clearly visible and reads 'BOC-480'. This matches exactly with the text seen in Image A. Despite the digital enhancements added to Image B (such as glowing blue lines and holographic displays), the license plate remains unaltered and legible. The alphanumeric sequence is consistent with real-world license plate formats, and the text is sharp and readable, confirming its accuracy.",

      "question": "Is the cyclist riding parallel to the car on the same road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cyclist is positioned on the right side of the road, while the car is traveling in the same direction but slightly ahead and to the left. Both are on the same paved road, separated by a white lane marking. Their relative positions suggest they are riding parallel to each other, maintaining a consistent lateral distance. This alignment is typical in support vehicles accompanying cyclists during time trials. The visual perspective confirms they are on the same roadway and moving in the same direction, indicating parallel movement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the road shows a landscape of dry, arid hills with minimal plant life. The terrain is rocky and dusty, with patches of low shrubs and scattered greenery, characteristic of a semi-desert or dry mountainous region. This aligns with typical environments used for outdoor cycling events in warm climates. The lighting and color tones further suggest a sunny, dry climate. Although the image has been enhanced with digital effects, the natural background remains consistent with dry hills and sparse vegetation, matching the original scene.",
