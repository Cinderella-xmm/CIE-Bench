      "question": "Is the central waterfall positioned vertically in the middle of the image, descending from the upper cliff to the river below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central waterfall is clearly visible and appears to originate from the top of a high cliff, flowing downward into a river at the base. The waterfall is centered within the composition, running vertically through the middle of the image, aligning with the visual axis between the foreground and background elements. This vertical alignment is consistent with natural waterfall formations where water descends from elevated terrain. The presence of mist at the base further supports the idea that it is a large, active waterfall falling directly into the river below. Based on the visual cues and typical geological patterns, the waterfall's positioning is indeed central and vertical.",

      "question": "Is there a large, curved tree on the left side of the image with a diagonal branch extending upward and bearing clusters of small purple flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the left side of Image B, there is a prominent tree with a thick, twisting trunk and an arched structure that curves upward diagonally. This tree is covered in lush green moss and vines, and along its branches, especially near the upper sections, there are clusters of small purple flowers interspersed among the foliage. These floral details are distinct and match the description provided. The combination of the tree’s shape and the presence of purple blossoms confirms the accuracy of this observation. This kind of botanical detail is common in tropical or fantasy-inspired environments, where flowering epiphytes and ornamental flora enhance visual richness.",

      "question": "Does the river originate in the foreground and curve toward the base of the central waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the river begins in the lower portion of the frame (foreground), winding gently from the bottom center toward the central waterfall. It flows in a slight arc, moving from the viewer’s perspective toward the base of the waterfall, where it collects the cascading water. The flow direction is supported by the orientation of ripples and reflections on the surface, as well as the placement of rocks and vegetation along its banks. The river does not originate from the waterfall itself but rather converges with it, suggesting a natural stream feeding into or being augmented by the waterfall. Thus, the river's path is correctly described as curving toward the waterfall’s base.",

      "question": "Are there visible rocks scattered along the riverbed in the foreground and midground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, in Image B, multiple dark-colored rocks are clearly visible within the riverbed. They are distributed across both the foreground and midground sections of the river, some partially submerged and others exposed above the waterline. These rocks vary in size and shape, contributing to the naturalistic appearance of the river. Their presence is consistent with typical river systems, where erosion and sediment deposition result in rocky outcrops. The lighting and reflections on the water also highlight their positions, making them easily identifiable.",

      "question": "Are there two smaller waterfalls visible on the right-hand cliff face, behind the main waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the main waterfall dominates the center, upon closer inspection of the right-hand cliff face—specifically behind and slightly to the right of the central cascade—two thinner, vertical streams of water can be observed. These secondary waterfalls are less prominent than the central one but are clearly distinguishable as separate flows descending from higher elevations. Their presence adds depth to the scene and suggests a complex topography typical of mountainous regions with multiple drainage points. Although they are somewhat obscured by mist and distance, they are still visually present and identifiable.",

      "question": "Is there a dense canopy at the top of the image with sunlight streaming through gaps, creating bright patches on the foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, the upper portion of the frame shows a thick layer of green foliage forming a dense canopy. Sunlight is visibly filtering through gaps in the leaves, casting bright, dappled light onto the surrounding vegetation below. These illuminated patches contrast with darker shaded areas, creating a dynamic interplay of light and shadow typical of forest environments. The presence of such lighting effects is consistent with natural daylight conditions in a jungle or rainforest setting, where overhead cover limits direct sunlight but allows beams to penetrate through openings. This effect enhances the sense of depth and realism in the scene.",

      "question": "Are there small purple flowers growing on the left side of the twisted tree, near the base of its branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the left side of the twisted tree in Image B, particularly near the lower part of its branches and along the trunk, there are clusters of small purple flowers. These blooms are nestled among green leaves and moss, adding color contrast to the otherwise verdant environment. Their placement near the base of the branches matches the description. This type of flowering pattern is plausible in tropical ecosystems, where epiphytic plants or climbing vines may bloom at various heights on trees. The flowers are clearly visible and not just artistic embellishments—they appear integrated into the tree’s structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a series of layered mountain ridges that extend horizontally across the horizon. These ridges progressively fade in clarity and color, transitioning from darker greens and blues in the midground to lighter, more ethereal tones in the distance. This atmospheric perspective is characteristic of real-world landscapes, where haze and distance reduce visibility and contrast. The sky above these mountains is a soft blue with subtle cloud formations, reinforcing the impression of depth. The overall composition suggests a vast, mountainous region, with multiple ridges contributing to the scenic backdrop.",
