      "question": "Is the brown horse with bridle and harness present in the same position and configuration as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brown horse is indeed present and positioned on the left side of the carriage, facing forward, similar to its placement in Image A. The horse is equipped with a bridle and harness, which are clearly visible and consistent with the typical attire of a draft horse in historical carriages. The configuration—such as the positioning of the reins, the shape of the harness, and the overall stance of the horse—matches that seen in Image A. However, while the general position and configuration are preserved, there are subtle differences in the stylization due to the cartoonish, toy-like rendering in Image B. The horse appears more simplified and less anatomically detailed than in the realistic painting of Image A. Despite these stylistic changes, the core elements (position, bridle, harness) remain functionally and spatially consistent. Therefore, based on visual cues and world knowledge of carriage composition, the horse is in the same position and configuration, albeit rendered differently.",

      "question": "Are the gilded carvings and red velvet curtains of the carriage preserved in their original form and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carriage features elaborate gilded carvings along its frame, including ornate scrollwork and decorative motifs, which are visually consistent with the opulent design seen in Image A. The red velvet curtains inside the carriage are also present, hanging from the interior edges, just as they appear in the original. However, the style of the carvings in Image B is more exaggerated and stylized, resembling plastic or sculpted toy details rather than the fine, hand-carved gold leaf work depicted in Image A. Similarly, the velvet curtains, while still red and positioned correctly, lack the depth and texture seen in the original painting. Nevertheless, both the form and position of the gilded carvings and red curtains are preserved, even if their material representation has been altered for a cartoon aesthetic. Thus, based on structural consistency and placement, they are preserved in form and position.",

      "question": "Is the coachman seated on the driver’s seat with his hands on the reins as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coachman is seated on the driver’s seat at the front of the carriage, just like in Image A. His hands are positioned on the reins, which extend toward the horse, indicating control over the animal. This posture matches the original image's depiction of the coachman actively guiding the carriage. While the coachman in Image B is stylized with exaggerated proportions and simplified facial features typical of a cartoon or figurine, his pose and functional interaction with the reins are preserved. The visual cue of hands on reins combined with the seated position confirms the continuity of action and role. Therefore, despite stylistic differences, the coachman's position and behavior align with the original.",

      "question": "Is the walking attendant in the dark blue coat and tricorn hat positioned beside the horse, holding a riding crop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the walking attendant is indeed positioned beside the horse, on the left side of the carriage, consistent with the original image. He is wearing a red robe with golden dragon patterns, not a dark blue coat and tricorn hat as seen in Image A. This indicates a significant change in attire, likely influenced by cultural symbolism—red and dragons being traditional in Chinese wedding iconography. Additionally, he holds a long stick or riding crop, which corresponds to the object held by the attendant in Image A. However, the clothing is fundamentally different, reflecting a thematic shift rather than preservation. Therefore, while the position and the object (riding crop) are preserved, the attire is not. Since the question specifically mentions 'dark blue coat and tricorn hat,' and these are absent in Image B, the answer must reflect this discrepancy.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carriage features large wooden wheels with clearly visible spokes, matching the number and arrangement seen in Image A. The wheels are positioned at the same relative locations—two in the front and two in the back—maintaining the structural integrity of the carriage. Although the wheels in Image B are rendered in a more stylized, toy-like manner with smoother surfaces and less textural detail, their form and position are consistent with the original. The presence of multiple spokes and the circular shape confirm that they are functionally and spatially preserved. Therefore, despite stylistic simplification, the wheels retain their original form and position.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is entirely different from Image A. Instead of a natural landscape with trees, grass, and a cloudy sky, Image B features a solid, deep red backdrop with a large red double happiness symbol (囍), commonly associated with Chinese weddings. This symbolic background replaces the pastoral setting of Image A completely. There are no trees or clouds present in Image B. This change reflects a cultural reinterpretation of the scene, shifting from a European aristocratic setting to a Chinese nuptial theme. Therefore, the original background composition is not preserved.",

      "question": "Are the gold leaf patterns and red velvet textures of the carriage preserved in their original appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold leaf patterns are present on the carriage, but they are stylized and simplified, appearing more like embossed plastic or painted ornamentation rather than actual gold leaf. The red velvet textures are also present, especially in the curtains and seat coverings, but they lack the depth, shading, and fabric-like quality seen in Image A. Instead, they appear flat and uniformly colored, consistent with a toy or figurine aesthetic. While the colors and basic design elements (gold and red) are preserved, the textures and materials are significantly altered. The original luxurious, painterly appearance is replaced with a cartoonish, three-dimensional model look. Therefore, although the visual motifs are retained, the original textures and appearances are not preserved.",
