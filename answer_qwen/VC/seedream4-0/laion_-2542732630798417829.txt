    "Question": "Q1: Is the glass bulb shaped like a teardrop with visible internal filaments present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass bulb is clearly depicted in both panels. In the top panel, the bulb is shown as part of a hanging fixture, and it has a distinct teardrop shape, which is consistent with traditional Edison-style bulbs. The internal filaments are visible, glowing with an orange-yellow hue, indicating that they are lit and intricately designed, typical of vintage filament bulbs. This visual detail aligns with real-world knowledge of incandescent bulbs, where the filament structure is often exposed and visible through the glass. The bottom panel reinforces this by showing the same bulb style, albeit anthropomorphized, but still retaining the teardrop shape and visible internal filaments. Thus, based on both visual cues and general knowledge of such bulbs, the answer is affirmative.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the curved vertical bars forming a cage-like structure around the bulb present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, particularly in the top panel, the bulb is encased in a metal framework composed of multiple curved vertical bars that form a protective cage-like structure. These bars are symmetrically arranged around the bulb, creating an open, industrial-style enclosure. This design is consistent with vintage or steampunk-inspired lighting fixtures, where such cages are used both functionally and aesthetically. The bottom panel also shows a similar cage structure, though stylized, confirming the presence of this feature. Comparing to real-world fixtures, this type of cage is common in industrial pendant lights to protect the bulb while allowing light to pass through. Therefore, the curved bars forming a cage are indeed present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the dark cylindrical housing at the top of the fixture with a visible screw detail present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top portion of the fixture in the upper panel features a dark, cylindrical housing from which the bulb hangs. This housing appears metallic and has a slightly textured surface, consistent with aged or industrial materials. Upon closer inspection, a small screw detail is visible near the top of the housing, likely securing the electrical connection or mounting mechanism. This matches real-world construction practices for such fixtures, where screws are used to fasten components. Although the lower panel does not show the top housing in detail, the upper panel provides sufficient evidence. Therefore, the dark cylindrical housing with a visible screw detail is present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the circular cap at the bottom of the metal cage present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the metal cage surrounding the bulb in the top panel terminates at the bottom with a circular cap that connects the curved bars. This cap is dark in color and appears to be made of the same material as the rest of the cage, providing structural stability. It is visible in both the top and bottom panels, even when stylized in the comic version. In real-world fixtures, such a cap is commonly used to anchor the base of the cage and prevent the bulb from slipping out. Given its consistent presence across both panels and alignment with known fixture designs, the circular cap at the bottom is indeed present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the glass bulb positioned centrally within the metal cage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the top and bottom panels depict the glass bulb centered within the metal cage. In the top panel, the bulb is perfectly aligned along the vertical axis of the cage, with equal spacing between the bulb and the curved bars on all sides. This central positioning is crucial for both aesthetic balance and functional safety in lighting fixtures. In the bottom panel, despite the cartoonish style, the bulb remains centered within the cage, maintaining symmetry. Real-world design principles emphasize central placement for even illumination and structural integrity. Therefore, based on visual alignment and design logic, the bulb is centrally positioned.",
    "answer": "Yes"
