      "question": "Does the lion’s silhouette retain the distinct, wide, rounded mane shape around its head and neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is presented as a black silhouette against a light background. Despite the lack of color and detail, the outline of the lion's mane is clearly defined and expansive, forming a broad, rounded shape that extends around the head and down the neck. This shape is characteristic of a mature male lion's mane, which is typically thick and voluminous. The silhouette captures this feature effectively, preserving the iconic, wide mane profile even in monochrome form. Based on visual cues and world knowledge about lion anatomy, the mane's distinctive shape is preserved in the silhouette.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lion depicted with its front legs forward and rear legs bent, maintaining a poised, dominant stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the silhouette in Image B, the lion's posture shows its front legs positioned forward and slightly apart, while the hind legs are bent at the knees, suggesting movement or a crouched stance. This configuration is consistent with a lion in a powerful, alert pose—often associated with dominance or readiness to move. The overall body alignment indicates balance and strength, typical of a lion in a commanding position. Using world knowledge about lion behavior and locomotion, this stance aligns with how lions often present themselves when asserting presence or preparing for action.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lion’s head turned slightly toward the viewer, rather than fully in profile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouette in Image B shows the lion’s head angled such that the face is not fully in profile but instead appears to be turned slightly toward the viewer. This is evident from the visible outline of the nose and the direction of the mane, which suggests a three-quarter view. In natural lion behavior, such a head orientation often signifies attentiveness or awareness of surroundings. While silhouettes lack facial details, the overall shape of the head and the positioning of the ears and jawline indicate a slight turn toward the viewer, not a full side profile.",

      "question": "Is there grass present in the foreground beneath the lion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground features fine, upward-pointing lines that represent tall grass, particularly visible beneath the lion’s paws and extending across the lower portion of the image. These lines are stylized but clearly intended to depict grass, consistent with the savanna environment. The texture and density of these lines suggest a field of grass, reinforcing the natural setting. Based on visual cues and common artistic conventions for depicting African landscapes, the presence of grass is unmistakable in the foreground.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are acacia trees visible in the background, either as natural forms or stylized silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B includes several dark, flat-topped shapes with branching structures that are stylistically consistent with acacia trees, which are iconic to African savannas. These silhouettes are simplified but recognizable due to their distinctive canopy shape and sparse branching pattern. Acacia trees are commonly found in such environments, and their inclusion here—whether natural or stylized—serves to reinforce the African wilderness theme. The visual cues match known representations of acacias in art and photography, confirming their presence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lion positioned in the foreground, centered and large in scale relative to the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion occupies a central position in the composition and dominates the visual space. Its silhouette is significantly larger than the surrounding elements, such as the acacia trees and grass, indicating it is placed in the foreground and emphasized as the primary subject. This compositional choice draws attention to the lion, reinforcing its symbolic role as 'King of the Wild.' The scale relationship between the lion and the background elements aligns with artistic conventions used to convey dominance and importance, supported by world knowledge of visual hierarchy in design.",
