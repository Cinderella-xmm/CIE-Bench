      "question": "Is there a female figure wearing a full-length kimono with a long trailing sleeve and wide hem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is clearly a woman dressed in traditional Japanese attire. The garment is a full-length kimono, identifiable by its long sleeves (furisode style) and wide, flowing hem that drapes elegantly along the ground. The design includes floral patterns typical of formal kimonos, and the fabric appears to extend beyond her feet, forming a trailing train. This aligns with the visual characteristics of a ceremonial or decorative kimono often seen in classical Japanese art. The depiction is consistent with historical and artistic representations of geisha or noblewomen in such garments.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned with her body angled to the right and her head turned back toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the posture of the female figure in Image B, her body is oriented diagonally, facing slightly to the right side of the frame. Her head is turned over her shoulder, looking directly toward the viewer. This pose is characteristic of many traditional Japanese woodblock prints (ukiyo-e), where figures are depicted in profile with a glance backward, creating a sense of narrative engagement. The angle and gaze suggest intentional composition, emphasizing elegance and poise.",

      "question": "Is there a straight stone-paved path bordered by evenly spaced cylindrical wooden posts on both sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The path in Image B is clearly defined as a linear, paved walkway made of rectangular stone slabs arranged in a grid pattern. On either side of the path, there are regularly spaced cylindrical wooden posts, resembling traditional Japanese fence markers or 'kakizome' posts used in garden pathways. These posts are uniform in height and spacing, reinforcing the symmetry and order typical of Japanese landscape design. The alignment of the path leads into the distance, suggesting depth and perspective.",

      "question": "Are there cherry blossom trees forming an arching canopy overhead with dense pink blooms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The upper portion of Image B features numerous cherry blossom trees whose branches extend across the top of the scene, forming a natural archway above the path. The blossoms are rendered in soft pink hues, densely packed, and appear to hang downward, creating a tunnel-like effect. This visual motif is iconic in Japanese art and culture, symbolizing the fleeting beauty of spring. The arrangement of the branches and flowers suggests a deliberate composition to emphasize the seasonal theme.",

      "question": "Are there fallen cherry blossom petals scattered along the edges of the path and surrounding grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Along the edges of the path in Image B, small clusters of pink petals are visible, particularly near the base of the wooden posts and on the grassy areas flanking the walkway. These petals are stylized but clearly represent fallen cherry blossoms, consistent with the seasonal setting. In traditional Japanese aesthetics, falling petals symbolize transience and beauty in impermanence. Their presence enhances the atmosphere of springtime and complements the blooming trees above.",

      "question": "Does the path extend straight ahead into a softly glowing, misty distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The path in Image B recedes into the background, converging toward a distant vanishing point. While the image uses flat color and line work typical of illustrative styles, the far end of the path appears lighter in tone, with a subtle gradient suggesting a glow or haze. This effect creates an impression of depth and atmospheric perspective, reminiscent of mist or early morning light filtering through the blossoms. Although not photorealistic, the artistic rendering implies a serene, ethereal distance, enhancing the dreamlike quality of the scene.",

      "question": "Is there a floral ornament, specifically a cluster of pink cherry blossoms and golden details, in the figureâ€™s hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman's hair in Image B is styled in a traditional updo, adorned with a decorative hairpiece. This ornament includes several pink flower elements that resemble cherry blossoms, consistent with the overall theme. Additionally, there are intricate golden accents within the accessory, possibly representing metallic threads or small ornaments commonly used in formal hairstyles. Such adornments are typical in depictions of high-status women in historical Japanese art, especially during cherry blossom season.",
