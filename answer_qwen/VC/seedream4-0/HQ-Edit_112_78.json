      "question": "Is the central floral medallion located on the front center of the body, surrounded by symmetrical scrollwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot's body features a prominent decorative element at its front center. This element is clearly a floral medallion, intricately detailed with ornate patterns that resemble flowers and foliage. Surrounding this medallion are elaborate scrollworks that extend outward symmetrically along the sides of the teapot’s body. The symmetry is evident in the mirrored design of the scrollwork on both left and right sides of the medallion. This arrangement aligns with traditional Baroque or Rococo-style metalwork, where central motifs are often flanked by balanced decorative elements. Based on visual analysis and knowledge of classical decorative arts, the presence and placement of the medallion and surrounding scrollwork confirm the description.",

      "question": "Does the spout extend from the left side of the body with a curled, scroll-like tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the spout is indeed positioned on the left side of the teapot’s body. Its form is not straight but elegantly curved, culminating in a tip that resembles a scroll or a stylized leaf, characteristic of ornamental metalware. This design is consistent with historical silverware aesthetics, where spouts are often embellished to match the overall decorative theme. The curvature and tip detail support the description of a 'curled, scroll-like tip.' Therefore, based on visual evidence and common design principles in fine metalwork, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Is the handle on the right side of the body shaped like a C with ornate volute ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle is located on the right side of the teapot. It forms a distinct C-shape, curving from the top to the bottom of the body. The ends of the handle are elaborately decorated with volute (scroll-like) motifs, which are typical in ornate metal designs. These volutes add a sense of movement and elegance, reinforcing the luxurious aesthetic. The shape and detailing are consistent with classical European silver teapots, particularly those from the 18th or 19th century. Thus, the handle matches the description precisely.",

      "question": "Is there a small decorative finial atop the lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lid of the teapot in Image B is topped with a small, ornate knob or finial. This finial is not plain; it features intricate detailing, including what appears to be a tiered or acorn-like structure, possibly with a tiny ball at the very top. Such finials are common in high-end silverware and serve both functional and decorative purposes. They allow for easy lifting of the lid while enhancing the overall aesthetic. Given the visual details and the standard design conventions for such objects, the presence of a decorative finial is confirmed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking closely at the base of the teapot in Image B, it rests on four distinct feet. Each foot is elaborately designed, featuring scrollwork and possibly acanthus leaf motifs, consistent with the rest of the ornamentation. These feet elevate the teapot slightly above the surface, providing stability and contributing to the overall grandeur. In fine metalwork, especially in antique or luxury pieces, such feet are common and often highly decorative. The visual evidence supports the existence of four ornate feet.",

      "question": "Are the floral and foliate patterns arranged symmetrically around the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teapot in Image B displays a rich array of floral and foliate patterns across its surface. These patterns are distributed in a way that suggests careful balance—each side of the central medallion mirrors the other in terms of motif placement and complexity. The scrollwork, leaves, and floral elements appear to radiate outward from the central medallion in a harmonious fashion. This symmetry is typical of formal decorative styles such as Rococo or Neoclassical design, where balance and repetition are key. Visual inspection confirms that the patterns are indeed arranged symmetrically.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a teapot with a classic, rounded body shape that is consistent with traditional teapot design. The lid is clearly domed, fitting snugly over the body and crowned with a finial. The spout and handle are positioned opposite each other, creating a balanced visual composition. The proportions of the spout and handle are harmonious with the body, ensuring that the overall silhouette remains elegant and stable. This design reflects conventional teapot engineering and aesthetics, where balance and proportion are essential. Therefore, the object retains the described silhouette.",
