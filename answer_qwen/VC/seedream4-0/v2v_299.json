      "question": "Does the edited image retain the airplane's wings, engines, and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane is clearly visible with distinct wings extending from both sides of the fuselage. The wings are decorated with golden dragon motifs and tassels, indicating they are present but stylized. Two large engines are mounted under the wings, consistent with typical aircraft design, though they appear more cartoonish in shape and size. The vertical stabilizer (tail) is also present, featuring a red color and Chinese characters, including the character '囍' (double happiness), which is commonly used in celebratory contexts. These components—wings, engines, and tail—are all structurally intact and identifiable despite artistic embellishments. Therefore, based on visual cues and common knowledge of airplane anatomy, these parts are retained.",

      "question": "Is the airplane still positioned on the runway in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane is situated on a paved surface with visible yellow markings, including the number '10' and guiding lines, which are characteristic of an airport runway. The aircraft's landing gear is in contact with the ground, and its orientation aligns with the direction of the runway. The lighting and shadows suggest it is stationary on the same surface as seen in Image A. Comparing this to Image A, where the airplane is also on the runway, the positioning remains consistent. Thus, the airplane is still positioned on the runway in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the edited image still feature a golden sunset background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a warm, orange-yellow sky with soft gradients transitioning from bright near the horizon to darker tones above, consistent with a sunset scene. The sun appears low on the left side of the frame, casting long shadows and illuminating the scene with golden light. This lighting condition matches the golden sunset observed in Image A. Additionally, the presence of floating lanterns in the sky enhances the festive, evening atmosphere, reinforcing the idea of a sunset setting. Based on visual cues such as color palette, light direction, and atmospheric elements, the golden sunset background is preserved.",

      "question": "Are the runway markings (\"10\" and guiding lines) still visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the runway marking '10' is prominently displayed in bold yellow numerals on the pavement directly beneath the airplane. Guiding lines, including the centerline and edge markings, are also visible, running parallel to the aircraft’s path. These markings are consistent with standard airport runway designations and are clearly legible despite the artistic style. In comparison to Image A, where similar markings are present, the edited version maintains these details, albeit with enhanced contrast due to the lighting. Thus, the runway markings remain visible.",

      "question": "Is the horizon line with distant tree silhouettes still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horizon line is visible, separating the sky from the flat terrain in the distance. While the distant landscape appears less detailed than in Image A, faint silhouettes of trees or vegetation can be discerned along the horizon. However, these features are much subtler and less defined compared to Image A, where the tree line is clearer and more prominent. The editing process has likely reduced the emphasis on natural background elements to highlight the stylized airplane and festive lanterns. Therefore, while a horizon exists, the tree silhouettes are not as clearly present or distinct.",
