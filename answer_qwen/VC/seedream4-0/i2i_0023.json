      "question": "Does the boy's face retain clear and recognizable features such as eyes, nose, and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy's face is stylized into a cartoon form. Despite the artistic transformation, the key facial features—eyes, nose, and mouth—are still clearly present and distinguishable. The eyes are represented with simple black dots, the nose is a small curved line, and the mouth is drawn as a red smile. These features are consistent with typical cartoon depictions of human faces, where simplification does not eliminate recognition. Based on visual cues and common knowledge of cartoon art, these features remain identifiable even though they are exaggerated or simplified.",

      "question": "Are all four original birds present, with the macaw on the shoulder, the cockatoo on the arm, the canary on the head, and the parakeet near the side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the four birds are visually represented in a cartoon style. The green-and-yellow macaw is positioned on the left shoulder, matching its placement in the original image. The white cockatoo is on the right arm, consistent with the original. The yellow canary is perched atop the boy’s head, and the small blue parakeet is near the right side of the body, close to the arm. Although their proportions and details are simplified, their positions relative to the boy match those in the original image. This alignment suggests that all four birds are preserved in both number and placement, albeit in a stylized format.",

      "question": "Is the cartoon print on the boy's green T-shirt still visible and intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green T-shirt in Image B features a cartoon design resembling characters from the 'Angry Birds' franchise, specifically the green pigs. The illustration includes multiple pig figures with distinct expressions and accessories (e.g., crowns, glasses). Although the image is stylized, the print remains clearly visible and intact, with no parts missing or obscured. The colors and shapes are consistent with the original design, and the layout is preserved. Even in the cartoonized version, the iconic elements of the graphic are recognizable, indicating that the print has been maintained.",

      "question": "Is the boy’s head visibly larger compared to the shrunken size of the birds in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy’s head appears proportionally larger than the birds, which are depicted in a smaller scale relative to his body. This is a common stylistic choice in cartoons, where human heads are often enlarged for expressive effect. The birds, while still clearly identifiable, are rendered with reduced detail and smaller dimensions compared to their real-world counterparts. However, this does not mean they are 'shrunken' in an unrealistic sense but rather stylized. The comparison with the original image shows that the birds were originally proportional to the boy, but in the cartoon version, the boy’s head is emphasized. Therefore, the head appears larger in relation to the birds due to artistic exaggeration.",

      "question": "Does the image feature a thick white outline around the boy and the birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a distinct thick white outline surrounding the entire figure of the boy and each bird. This outline is characteristic of sticker-style or cutout illustrations, where a clean border separates the subject from the background. The white line is consistent in thickness and runs along the edges of all elements, including the boy’s limbs, head, and each bird. This is a deliberate stylistic choice to give the image a sticker-like appearance, commonly seen in digital art and clipart. The presence of this outline is evident across the entire composition, confirming its inclusion.",
