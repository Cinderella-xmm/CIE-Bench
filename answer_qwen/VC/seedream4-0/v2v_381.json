        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are painted with a prominent triangular motif on their bodies, which closely resembles the shape of a pyramid. This design element is clearly visible across all dolls, with the triangle occupying a central position on each doll's torso. The triangular shape is stylized to mimic the structure of a stone pyramid, including horizontal lines that suggest stacked blocks. This visual cue, combined with world knowledge of how pyramids are typically represented in art and design (as triangular forms), supports the conclusion that the dolls maintain a triangular shape inspired by the pyramid. The consistency of this design across all sizes further reinforces its intentional use as a thematic element.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls retain the stone texture seen in the original pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B feature a painted representation of a pyramid, but the surface texture depicted is not realistic stone. Instead, the pyramid design is rendered in smooth, flat colors with simple lines suggesting brickwork, lacking the rough, granular texture of actual stone. In contrast, Image A shows a real stone pyramid with visible block textures, weathering, and depth that convey a tactile, rugged surface. The dolls' depiction is stylized and cartoonish, prioritizing aesthetic appeal over realism. Therefore, while the pyramid shape is preserved, the stone texture is not retained. This distinction arises from the difference between a physical architectural structure and a decorative, artistic interpretation.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls designed with a symmetrical structure similar to the original pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each nesting doll in Image B displays a symmetrical design centered around the painted pyramid motif. The triangular shape is evenly proportioned, with balanced elements such as the facial features and background patterns on either side of the pyramid. This symmetry mirrors the geometric precision of the original pyramid in Image A, which is inherently symmetrical in its construction—its four triangular faces meet at a central apex. While the dolls are smaller and stylized, their core design maintains the same bilateral symmetry as the pyramid. Thus, despite differences in scale and medium, the structural symmetry is preserved in the dolls' design.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls arranged in descending size order on the wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are placed in a linear sequence from left to right, with each subsequent doll being visibly smaller than the one before it. This arrangement follows the traditional nesting doll setup, where larger dolls contain smaller ones. The progression is clear and consistent, starting with the largest doll on the far left and ending with the smallest on the far right. This ordering reflects both functional design (for nesting) and aesthetic balance. Based on visual cues alone, the descending size order is evident and intentional.",

      "question": "Do the largest nesting doll and possibly others incorporate a design element resembling the pyramid's central entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pyramid in Image A features a central entrance with a rectangular doorway framed by columns and steps leading up to it. In Image B, the largest nesting doll—and indeed all the dolls—include a painted pyramid design, but there is no visible representation of a doorway or entrance. The pyramid illustration is simplified and lacks architectural details such as an opening or steps. While the overall shape is accurate, key structural elements like the entrance are omitted. Therefore, the design does not include a feature corresponding to the pyramid's central entrance, even though the general form is preserved.",
