      "question": "Does the edited image retain the detailed tactical suit design, including the texture and pocket placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted as a figurine or collectible statue, which means the design has been adapted to a three-dimensional model format. Despite this transformation, the tactical suit retains key visual elements such as the segmented panels, zippers, and structured texture that mimic leather and fabric materials. The pockets are visible on the waist belt and thigh area, consistent with the original suit's functional design. These details suggest that the designer aimed to preserve the authenticity of the tactical suit’s appearance, even in a stylized form. While some minor simplifications may occur due to scale or manufacturing constraints, the overall texture and pocket placement remain faithful to the original.",

      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the character’s red hair with the same wavy style and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s hair is rendered in a vibrant red hue, consistent with the original depiction. The wavy, shoulder-length style is preserved, though it appears slightly more stylized and simplified due to the nature of the figurine. The curls are defined and follow the same general shape as in the original, indicating that the artist maintained the core aesthetic of the hairstyle. Although the texture might be less realistic than in a photograph, the color and wave pattern are accurately represented.",

      "question": "Is the character’s original pose, showing a confident stance, retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character stands upright with legs slightly apart and arms relaxed at her sides, which conveys a confident and ready posture. This stance aligns closely with the typical portrayal of the character in cinematic and promotional material—projecting strength and readiness. While the pose is not identical to the dynamic angle seen in Image A (which features a close-up), the overall body language remains consistent with the character’s confident demeanor. The figurine captures the essence of the original pose, albeit adapted for display purposes.",

      "question": "Are the red straps, contrasting sharply with the black suit, still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red straps are clearly visible across the shoulders, running from the back over the shoulders to the front, forming part of the harness system. These straps are a defining feature of the character’s outfit and are rendered in the same bright red color that contrasts sharply with the black suit. Their presence is consistent with the original design, and they serve both aesthetic and functional purposes in the costume. Even in the stylized 3D model, the contrast between red and black is preserved, maintaining visual impact.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the primary black color of the tactical suit with red highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character wearing a predominantly black tactical suit, with red accents on the shoulder straps, wrist devices, and other small components like the utility belt and side gadgets. These red highlights are strategically placed to match the original design, providing visual contrast and reinforcing the character’s signature look. The use of red as an accent color is consistent with the original costume, and the black base remains dominant throughout the suit. Thus, the color scheme is faithfully maintained in the edited image.",
