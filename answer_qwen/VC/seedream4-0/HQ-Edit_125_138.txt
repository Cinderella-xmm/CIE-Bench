    "Question": "Q1: Is the dancer wearing a tall, flame-shaped golden headdress with upward-curving elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is clearly depicted wearing an elaborate headdress that rises vertically above her head. The structure of the headdress resembles flames, with multiple upward-curving and pointed elements that mimic fire or stylized floral motifs. This design is consistent with traditional Balinese ceremonial headdresses, especially those worn during ritual dances such as the Legong or Barong performances. The golden color and intricate detailing further support this interpretation. Based on visual cues and cultural knowledge of Balinese dance attire, the headdress matches the description of being tall, flame-shaped, and featuring upward-curving elements.",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the dancer have white-painted skin, darkened eyes, and red lips?",
    "explanation": "Observing the dancer in Image B, her facial features are distinctly stylized. Her skin appears to be painted white, which is characteristic of traditional Balinese dance makeup used to highlight facial expressions and enhance visibility under natural or stage lighting. Her eyes are accentuated with darkened outlines, creating a dramatic effect typical of classical Indonesian dance aesthetics.

    "Question": "Q3: Is the dancer in a dynamic pose with one arm raised near the head and the other extended forward?",
    "explanation": "The dancer in Image B is captured mid-movement in a graceful, expressive posture. Her right arm is bent at the elbow and raised close to her head, while her left arm is fully extended forward, forming a balanced and flowing line. This pose reflects the fluidity and precision typical of Balinese dance, where hand gestures (mudras) and body alignment carry symbolic meaning. The positioning suggests motion and elegance, consistent with traditional dance choreography.

    "Question": "Q4: Is the temple composed of multiple stacked tiers with curved, upward-pointing roofs?",
    "explanation": "The central structure in Image B is a detailed architectural rendering of a Balinese temple, specifically resembling a pura (temple) with a multi-tiered roof system. Each tier is progressively smaller as it ascends, forming a stepped pyramid shape. The roofs are curved and point upward, a distinctive feature of Balinese Hindu temples, designed to resemble Mount Meru, the mythical center of the universe in Hindu cosmology. The outline style emphasizes the layered construction and ornamental details, confirming that the temple has multiple stacked tiers with upward-pointing roofs.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are there two large, identical-looking mythical creatures standing symmetrically on either side of the dancer?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, two large, intricately drawn mythical creatures flank the dancer on both sides. These figures appear to be representations of Barong or similar protective deities from Balinese mythology, characterized by fierce facial expressions, open mouths, and elaborate headdresses. They are positioned symmetrically—one on the left and one on the right—mirroring each other in size, posture, and design. Their placement creates a balanced composition, reinforcing the sense of ritual symmetry often found in Balinese art and architecture. Thus, they are identical in appearance and symmetrically arranged.",

    "Question": "Q6: Are there smaller seated statues located on the pedestals beneath each of the large mythical creatures?",
    "explanation": "Below each of the large mythical creatures in Image B, there are small, seated figures placed on individual pedestals. These figures are depicted in meditative or prayer-like postures, typical of Buddhist or Hindu deities or ancestors commonly found in Balinese temple complexes. Their presence beneath the larger guardian figures follows a common motif in Balinese religious art, where smaller statues represent spiritual beings or offerings. The symmetry and repetition of these smaller statues on both sides confirm their intentional inclusion in the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Does the dancer wear a visible gold necklace and bracelets?",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the dancer in Image B, she is adorned with jewelry that includes a prominent gold necklace around her neck and matching gold bracelets on both wrists. These accessories are clearly visible despite the artistic rendering style. In traditional Balinese dance, dancers typically wear ornate gold jewelry as part of their costume, symbolizing divine connection and cultural heritage.
