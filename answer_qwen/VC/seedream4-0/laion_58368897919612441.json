      "question": "Are both corner towers with domed roofs and weather vanes present and positioned at the upper corners of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is framed within a snow globe, which contains a miniature representation of the Tower of London. Despite the scale reduction and artistic interpretation, the two corner towers are clearly visible at the upper corners of the structure. Each tower features a domed roof topped with a weather vane, consistent with the historical design of the White Tower. The presence of these elements is preserved in the model, even though they are smaller and stylized. Based on world knowledge, the actual White Tower does have such corner towers with domed roofs and weather vanes, and this detail is accurately reflected in the snow globe version. Therefore, both towers are present and correctly positioned.",

      "question": "Is the crenellated parapet running along the top edge of the tower intact and continuous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top edge of the tower within the snow globe shows a crenellated parapet, which is a series of alternating merlons and crenels typical of medieval fortifications. The structure appears to be intact and continuous across the top of the tower, despite the reduced scale. This feature aligns with historical architectural details of the Tower of London, where the crenellations are a defining characteristic. The snow globe model faithfully reproduces this element, maintaining its continuity and form. Thus, based on visual cues and architectural knowledge, the parapet is intact and continuous.",

      "question": "Are the arched windows arranged symmetrically across the façade, including the triplet groupings above the main level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the snow globe in Image B, the façade of the tower displays a symmetrical arrangement of arched windows. On each side of the central axis, there are matching sets of windows, including the distinctive triplet groupings located above the main level. These triplets are evenly spaced and mirrored on both sides, reflecting the actual symmetry of the White Tower's architecture. Even though the model is scaled down, the layout remains faithful to the original design. World knowledge confirms that the Tower of London’s façade features such symmetrical window placement, and this is preserved in the miniature representation.",

      "question": "Is there a central arched entrance at ground level, directly beneath the central section of the façade, with a wooden drawbridge structure extending forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the tower within the snow globe includes a central arched entrance, located directly beneath the middle of the façade. A wooden drawbridge extends from this entrance toward the foreground, forming a pathway over a small gap. The drawbridge is detailed and clearly visible, suggesting it is an intentional feature of the model. This matches the historical design of the Tower of London, where a drawbridge was used for access. The snow globe version captures this key structural element accurately, indicating that both the entrance and drawbridge are present.",

      "question": "Are there horizontal bands of alternating light and dark stone visible across the exterior walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the exterior walls of the tower within the snow globe appear to be constructed from uniform stone without clear horizontal bands of alternating light and dark materials. While the actual Tower of London features such masonry patterns due to its use of different stone types over time, the miniature model simplifies this detail. The texture and coloration in the snow globe suggest a more homogeneous surface, lacking the distinct banding seen in real-life photographs. Therefore, although the real structure has these bands, the model does not represent them accurately. Based on visual analysis, no such bands are evident in the image.",

      "question": "Does the tower maintain a tall, rectangular mass with two prominent corner towers projecting outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower within the snow globe retains the general shape of a tall, rectangular mass, consistent with the White Tower’s original design. Two prominent corner towers are clearly visible, projecting outward from the main structure. These towers are positioned at the corners and rise above the main body, contributing to the building’s iconic silhouette. Although the model is scaled down and stylized, the overall form remains true to the architectural reality. World knowledge confirms that the White Tower is indeed rectangular with projecting corner towers, and this is preserved in the miniature representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden drawbridge leading to the central entrance of the tower is visibly constructed with a crisscross lattice pattern of beams. This structural design is clearly depicted in the model, with diagonal supports forming an X-shaped grid across the bridge’s surface. This pattern is both functional and decorative, resembling historical timber construction methods. The snow globe model captures this detail accurately, and it aligns with known designs of medieval drawbridges. Therefore, the crisscross lattice pattern is present and correctly represented.",
