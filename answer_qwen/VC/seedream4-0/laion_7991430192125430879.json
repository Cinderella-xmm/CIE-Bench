      "question": "Is the black bat with outstretched wings inside a red circle present on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label of the bottle is constructed from LEGO bricks, but it clearly depicts a central emblem that matches the iconic Bacardi logo. The emblem features a black bat with outstretched wings enclosed within a red circular background, which is consistent with the official Bacardi branding. This design is recognizable even in its pixelated LEGO form due to the distinct shape and color scheme. World knowledge confirms that the Bacardi logo includes this specific bat symbol, and the visual representation in Image B accurately reflects it, despite the blocky construction.",

      "question": "Is the word \"BACARDÍ\" displayed in bold black serif font above the word \"MOJITO\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'BACARDÍ' is prominently displayed in large, bold letters using a black serif font, positioned directly above 'MOJITO'. Although the letters are made of LEGO bricks, their arrangement and style closely mimic the original typography used by Bacardi. The use of a serif font is evident in the small decorative strokes at the ends of the letters, and the boldness is preserved through the thickness of the brick construction. Comparing this to standard Bacardi labeling (as seen in Image A), the font style and placement are accurate. Therefore, the representation aligns with the expected branding.",

      "question": "Is the word \"MOJITO\" written in green sans-serif font below \"BACARDÍ\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'MOJITO' appears beneath 'BACARDÍ' and is rendered in green. The font lacks serifs—meaning no decorative strokes at the ends of the letters—and has a clean, modern appearance consistent with a sans-serif typeface. While the LEGO blocks give it a pixelated look, the overall structure and spacing match the sans-serif style used in the original product label. From world knowledge, Bacardi's Mojito line uses a green sans-serif font for the product name, and this LEGO version faithfully replicates that choice.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, below the word 'MOJITO', there is a cursive-style inscription that reads 'Facundo Bacardí'. Despite being built from LEGO bricks, the flowing, handwritten-like shape of the letters clearly mimics a signature. This detail is consistent with the authentic Bacardi label design, where the founder’s signature is a key branding element. Even though the resolution is lower due to the LEGO medium, the intent and form of the cursive script are preserved. Thus, based on both visual cues and brand knowledge, this feature is present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, near the bottom left of the label, there is a small green icon composed of LEGO bricks that resembles a mint leaf. This matches the typical placement and appearance of the mint leaf symbol on the original Bacardi Mojito bottle, which signifies the natural mint flavor. Although stylized due to the block construction, the shape and color are unmistakable as a mint leaf. World knowledge confirms that this icon is part of the official branding, and the LEGO version maintains its presence and position.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the mint leaf icon and slightly to the right, the text 'natural mint flavor, lime juice, cane sugar' is visible. It is constructed from small LEGO bricks and arranged in a horizontal line, consistent with the ingredient list found on the actual Bacardi Mojito bottle. The text is legible enough to identify these ingredients, and their inclusion aligns with the product's description. This information is standard on the real product label, and the LEGO recreation captures it accurately.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, just below the ingredient list, the phrase 'Simply pour over ice' is clearly visible in black text made from LEGO bricks. This instruction is a hallmark of Bacardi Mojito packaging, emphasizing ease of use. The font and placement match the original label, and although the text is blocky, it remains readable and correctly positioned. This detail is consistent with both the brand's messaging and the visual evidence in the image.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text '15% ALC. BY VOL.' is located near the bottom-left corner of the label, adjacent to the mint leaf icon. It is built from small LEGO bricks and is legible despite the scale. This alcohol content information is standard on Bacardi Mojito bottles and is accurately represented here. The placement and formatting match the original product label, confirming its presence in the LEGO model.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bottle has a distinct curved body that tapers toward the top, forming a narrow neck. This silhouette closely mirrors the original Bacardi Mojito bottle's shape, which is designed to be ergonomic and visually distinctive. The curvature is achieved through careful stacking of LEGO bricks, creating a smooth transition from the base to the neck. World knowledge confirms that Bacardi bottles have this characteristic shape, and the LEGO version successfully replicates it, preserving the brand’s iconic form.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap of the bottle is constructed from blue LEGO bricks stacked vertically in a circular pattern, forming a cylindrical shape. It has a uniform diameter along its height, with a flat top and rounded edges, consistent with the appearance of a standard bottle cap. While not identical to the real green metal cap, the LEGO version maintains the cylindrical geometry. This shape is typical for beverage caps, and the model adheres to that design principle, even if the material and color differ.",
