      "question": "Is the white beard and mustache clearly visible on the man’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's face is clearly depicted with a full white beard and mustache. These facial features are well-defined and stand out against his skin tone, consistent with typical representations of an elderly man in outdoor settings. The lighting in the image enhances the visibility of these features, making them prominent. This aligns with common visual cues used in realistic or semi-realistic illustrations to emphasize age and character. There is no ambiguity in the depiction; the beard and mustache are clearly rendered.",

      "question": "Is the wide-brimmed olive-green hat present on the man’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is wearing a wide-brimmed hat that appears to be olive-green in color. The hat has a distinct shape typical of outdoor or fishing hats, designed to provide sun protection. The coloration and texture are consistent with olive-green fabric, commonly used in such attire. The hat is positioned correctly on the man’s head, and its presence is unambiguous. This matches standard depictions of fishermen in natural settings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The man’s shirt in Image B displays a clear red-and-brown plaid pattern. The pattern consists of intersecting horizontal and vertical bands in shades of red and brown, forming a checkered design typical of flannel shirts. This type of clothing is commonly associated with outdoor activities and rural or rustic environments. The pattern is detailed and distinguishable across the entire shirt, confirming its visibility.",

      "question": "Is the wooden stool positioned beneath the man in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is seated on a wooden stool that is partially submerged in the water. The stool is clearly visible beneath him, with its legs extending into the water. The structure is consistent with a simple wooden bench or stool, commonly used for fishing. Its placement directly under the man confirms it is supporting him, and the water level around it shows it is indeed in the lake. This setup is typical in fishing scenes where individuals sit near or in the water.",

      "question": "Is a fishing line visible extending from the rod into the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a thin fishing line can be seen extending from the tip of the fishing rod down into the water. The line is faint but discernible, especially as it creates subtle ripples or disturbances in the water surface. In realistic fishing scenarios, such lines are typically taut or slightly curved, and their presence is crucial for casting and catching fish. The line's continuity from the rod to the water supports this interpretation.",

      "question": "Is the spinning reel visible, either attached to the rod or floating nearby?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spinning reel is visible and appears to be detached from the rod, floating nearby in the water. It is shown separately from the rod, suggesting it may have fallen off or been placed there intentionally. The reel is detailed, with a metallic body and handle, consistent with standard fishing reels. While not attached to the rod, its presence in the scene is clear, fulfilling the requirement of being 'visible.'",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is a clear reflection of the man, hat, shirt, rod, and stool visible in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface reflects the man, his hat, shirt, fishing rod, and stool with high clarity. The reflection is symmetrical and detailed, showing inverted images of all elements. The stillness of the water allows for a mirror-like effect, which is typical in calm lakes. The reflection includes the man’s facial features, clothing patterns, and the structure of the stool and rod, indicating a high degree of visual fidelity. This mirrors real-world physics where calm water acts like a reflective surface.",

      "question": "Are tall pine trees visible along the shoreline in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, tall pine trees are clearly visible along the shoreline in the background. These trees are conical in shape, with dense green foliage, characteristic of pine species commonly found in forested lake areas. They form a continuous line behind the man, reinforcing the natural, serene setting. Their presence is consistent with typical wilderness landscapes, especially those associated with fishing locations.",

      "question": "Are white clouds visible in the sky and reflected in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, white clouds are visible in the sky above the man and are also reflected in the water below. The clouds are fluffy and scattered across a blue sky, typical of a clear day. Their reflection in the water is crisp and accurate, matching the shape and position of the clouds above. This symmetry between sky and water is a hallmark of calm, reflective surfaces and is consistent with natural optical phenomena.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is seated with his legs crossed at the ankles, and one hand is holding the fishing rod. His posture is relaxed, with the right leg over the left, and the right hand gripping the rod. This positioning is consistent with a casual fishing stance. The detail in the limbs and hands confirms the crossing of the ankles and the grip on the rod, which is typical in such illustrative depictions of fishermen.",
