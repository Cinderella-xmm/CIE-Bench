      "question": "Does the edited image retain the presence of two parallel railway tracks extending into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible railway tracks at all. Instead, the scene features a desert landscape with wavy, striped patterns on the ground that resemble sand dunes or abstract terrain. There is a floating ancient-style vase in the center of the image, but no infrastructure such as railway tracks. This contrasts sharply with typical representations of railway tracks, which are linear, metallic, and often run through natural landscapes. Since the image lacks any trace of railway tracks, it is clear that they have been removed or replaced entirely in the edited version.",

      "question": "Is the railway track visibly curved to the right as it recedes into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) does not contain any railway tracks. Instead, the ground consists of smooth, flowing, wavy lines that create an abstract desert-like pattern. These lines curve in various directions, but they are not railway tracks. Therefore, the concept of a railway track curving to the right is irrelevant in this context. The absence of any rail infrastructure means the question about its curvature cannot be answered affirmatively.",

      "question": "Is the UFO positioned directly above the central axis of the railway track?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a UFO or any railway track. Instead, it shows a large, ornate ceramic vase floating above a surreal desert landscape. The object in the sky is clearly a vase, not a flying saucer, and there is no railway track present to define a central axis. Thus, the premise of the question — that a UFO is above a railway track — is invalid in this image. The positioning of objects relative to non-existent elements cannot be assessed.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clear horizontal line separating the sky from the land in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct boundary between the sky and the ground. The sky occupies the upper portion of the image, featuring clouds and a gradient from blue to warm hues near the horizon. The lower portion consists of a flat, undulating desert landscape with layered, wavy patterns. Although the horizon is not perfectly straight due to the stylized nature of the terrain, there is still a clear visual separation between the sky and the land, forming a horizontal line. This is consistent with typical landscape compositions where the horizon defines the division between earth and sky.",

      "question": "Is the railway track visibly elevated above the surrounding ground level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any railway tracks. The ground appears to be a continuous, smooth desert surface with artistic, wave-like patterns. There are no raised structures or embankments resembling railway tracks. Without the presence of a railway, the question of elevation is not applicable. Therefore, the answer must reflect the absence of the object in question.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the railway tracks converge toward a single point on the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no railway tracks present in Image B. The ground features abstract, curving stripes that may give a sense of depth, but they do not represent railway tracks. In real-world perspective, railway tracks often appear to converge at a vanishing point on the horizon, but this phenomenon is absent here because the tracks themselves are not present. The visual cues in the image suggest a stylized, surreal environment rather than a realistic one with linear perspective based on infrastructure.",
