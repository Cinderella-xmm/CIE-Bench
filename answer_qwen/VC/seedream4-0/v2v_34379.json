      "question": "Are the broccoli florets in both dishes still composed of distinct tree-like branching structures with dark green crowns and lighter green stems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli florets in the left dish appear to retain their natural tree-like branching structure, with dark green crowns and lighter green stems, consistent with raw broccoli. However, in the right dish, the broccoli has been roasted, which causes significant changes: the color has darkened, and the texture appears more shriveled and charred. While the basic branching structure is still recognizable, the crowns are now browned or blackened due to roasting, and the distinction between crown and stem is less clear. Thus, although the overall shape remains somewhat similar, the visual characteristics have changed significantly due to cooking. Based on world knowledge, roasting alters the appearance of vegetables by caramelizing sugars and causing charring, especially at the edges. Therefore, while the structural form may be preserved, the 'distinct' green coloration and crispness are lost.",

      "question": "Do the cauliflower florets retain their compact, rounded, and textured white clusters regardless of size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cauliflower florets in the left dish (raw) clearly show compact, rounded, and textured white clusters, consistent with fresh cauliflower. In the right dish, the cauliflower has been roasted, leading to browning, shrinkage, and some textural changes. The clusters are no longer uniformly white but exhibit golden-brown and darkened areas from caramelization and charring. While they maintain a somewhat rounded shape, their texture appears denser and less fluffy than raw cauliflower. Roasting typically causes moisture loss and surface browning, altering the original appearance. Therefore, although the general cluster shape persists, the 'white' and 'compact' qualities are compromised due to cooking.",

      "question": "Are the vegetables in the left dish still bright green (broccoli) and creamy white (cauliflower), without any browning or charring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left dish contains what appears to be raw vegetables. The broccoli florets display a vibrant, bright green color, and the cauliflower florets are creamy white, with no visible signs of browning or charring. This matches the expected appearance of fresh, uncooked broccoli and cauliflower. Cooking processes like roasting or grilling would introduce browning and charring, but these are absent here. Based on world knowledge, raw cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower have distinct colors: deep green for broccoli and off-white for cauliflower. The absence of discoloration supports that these vegetables are uncooked. Hence, they retain their original, fresh appearance.",

      "question": "Do the vegetables in the right dish still exhibit golden-brown caramelization and dark charred edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables in the right dish have undergone roasting, as indicated by their color and texture. Both broccoli and cauliflower florets show extensive golden-brown caramelization, particularly around the edges, along with dark charred spots. This is typical of high-heat roasting, where sugars caramelize and Maillard reactions occur, resulting in browning and charring. The surfaces are unevenly colored, with some parts deeply browned and others slightly darker, indicating exposure to heat. This aligns with common culinary knowledge about roasted vegetables. Therefore, the presence of both golden-brown and charred areas confirms the cooking method and visual transformation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both dishes are visually identical in shape: rectangular with rounded corners and two handles—one at the top and one at the bottom. They appear to be made of a smooth, glossy white material consistent with ceramic or porcelain baking dishes. There are no visible differences in shape, size, or material between the two dishes. This uniformity suggests they are part of a matching set. From world knowledge, such dishes are commonly used for roasting and are often sold as pairs. The consistency in design across both dishes supports the conclusion that they are identical in form and material.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background beneath the dishes is a light brown surface with clear horizontal wood grain patterns. The texture and color suggest it is a wooden table or cutting board. The grain runs horizontally across the image, and the surface shows natural variations in tone and pattern typical of wood. This matches the description of a light brown wooden surface with visible grain. Based on common kitchen settings, such surfaces are frequently used for food photography to provide a warm, natural backdrop. The lighting highlights the grain, confirming its presence and direction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dish on the left contains bright green broccoli and creamy white cauliflower, which are characteristic of raw vegetables. The dish on the right contains vegetables that are browned, charred, and shriveled—clear indicators of roasting. This arrangement is consistent with a before-and-after presentation: raw on the left, cooked on the right. This setup is common in food photography to showcase transformation through cooking. Based on world knowledge, raw vegetables retain their natural colors and textures, while roasted ones darken and develop crusts. The visual contrast supports this interpretation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right dish shows roasted vegetables with noticeable browning and charring, especially around the edges. Additionally, there are small dark specks scattered within the dish, likely remnants of seasoning such as salt, pepper, or herbs, or possibly bits of caramelized vegetable residue. These specks are visible against the lighter surface of the dish, particularly near the base and around the vegetables. Such residues are common when roasting vegetables, as oils, seasonings, and natural juices drip and cook onto the dish surface. This observation aligns with culinary practices where roasted vegetables leave behind traces of flavoring and browning.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to come from directly above, as evidenced by the lack of strong shadows beneath the dishes or vegetables. The illumination is even across the entire scene, with soft highlights on the surfaces of the vegetables and dishes, suggesting overhead lighting. This type of lighting is typical in food photography to avoid harsh shadows and emphasize texture and color. The absence of directional shadows indicates a diffuse, top-down light source, which enhances visibility and clarity. Based on photographic principles, such lighting minimizes depth cues and maximizes detail visibility.",
