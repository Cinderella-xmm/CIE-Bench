      "question": "Are the red eye lenses present in the head of the robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's head is clearly visible, and the eye area shows two distinct red circular lenses. These are consistent with typical mecha design aesthetics, where glowing or colored eyes indicate active systems or sensors. The red coloration is prominent and matches common visual cues used in anime and mecha designs to denote alertness or combat readiness. Based on visual inspection, the red eye lenses are indeed present.",

      "question": "Are there three orange circular thruster nozzles on each foot of the robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the feet of the robot in Image B, both feet display three orange circular elements at the heel region. These are positioned symmetrically and resemble thruster nozzles, commonly used in mecha designs for propulsion or maneuvering. Their placement and shape align with typical mechanical engineering aesthetics seen in science fiction robotics. Both feet have this configuration, confirming the presence of three orange nozzles per foot.",

      "question": "Is a long, straight sword being held in the robot’s left hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's left hand is gripping a long, slender blade that extends downward from the hand. The blade is straight and appears metallic, consistent with a sword-like weapon. It is held firmly, and its position suggests it is part of the robot's armament. This matches the typical portrayal of melee weapons in mecha designs. There is no ambiguity in the object's identity as a sword based on its form and positioning.",

      "question": "Are there two wing-like structures on the back of the robot, each with an orange tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The back of the robot in Image B features two large, angular structures extending upward and backward, resembling wings. Each structure has a pointed tip that is colored orange, contrasting with the gray and white body. These are characteristic of stabilizers or flight-assist fins in mecha design, often used for balance or aerodynamic control. The orange tips are clearly visible and match the accent color scheme of the robot.",

      "question": "Is a long rifle being held in the robot’s right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot's right hand in Image B is holding a long, black firearm with a visible barrel, magazine, and grip—consistent with a rifle design. The weapon is angled upward and appears to be part of the robot's primary ranged weaponry. Its size and shape align with standard mecha rifles seen in anime and model kits. This is confirmed by the clear structural details such as the stock and trigger guard.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the robot primarily colored in gray and white with orange accent markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B displays a dominant color scheme of dark gray and light gray, with significant white sections on the torso, limbs, and wing structures. Orange accents are strategically placed on the wing tips, feet, and parts of the head and shoulders. This color palette is typical of many Gundam-style mechas, where neutral tones are paired with bright highlights for visual distinction. The overall appearance confirms the primary use of gray and white with orange as an accent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the robot posed with one leg bent forward and the other extended backward, suggesting forward motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot's stance in Image B shows the right leg bent forward, with the knee raised and the foot planted, while the left leg is extended backward, creating a dynamic pose. This posture is characteristic of movement or momentum, often used in action-oriented illustrations to convey speed or aggression. The angle of the limbs and the orientation of the body suggest forward progression, typical of combat-ready stances in mecha designs.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom-left corner contains a watermark with the text '©SOTSU·SUNRISE'. This is a standard copyright notice used by Sunrise Inc., a well-known Japanese animation studio responsible for the Gundam franchise. The presence of this logo is consistent with official promotional material for Gundam-related products. The text is clearly legible and matches the font and style used in official releases.",
