      "question": "Are the emerald-green gemstones present in the same oval-cut shape and vibrant green color as in the original necklace?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene has changed significantly from a necklace display to a glass dome terrarium. The emerald-green gemstones are no longer part of a necklace but are instead embedded within the decorative elements inside the dome. However, upon close inspection, there are no visible oval-cut gemstones resembling those on the original necklace. Instead, the green color is present in the form of the snake's body and the glowing water in the pond. There is no evidence of gemstones with the same cut or placement as in the original necklace. Therefore, based on visual analysis and reasoning, the emerald-green gemstones are not present in the same form.",

      "question": "Is the necklace made of metal with a darkened, oxidized silver finish, showing visible contrast in the engraved details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain the necklace at all; instead, it features a glass dome with a chandelier, moss, water, and a snake. There is no metallic necklace visible in this image. Therefore, it is impossible to assess whether the necklace has a darkened, oxidized silver finish or detailed engravings because the object itself is absent. This conclusion is drawn by analyzing the content of Image B independently and recognizing that the necklace is not present.",

      "question": "Does the necklace retain the complex symmetrical scrollwork and decorative floral patterns throughout its structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The necklace is not present in Image B. The image instead shows a fantastical terrarium setup with a chandelier, moss, water, and a snake. Since the necklace is completely absent, it cannot retain any structural features such as scrollwork or floral patterns. This determination is based on the direct observation that the necklace is not in the scene, making the question about its design irrelevant in this context.",

      "question": "Is the snake tail still present with its original lime-green color, visible scales, and curved form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snake is clearly visible. It has a bright lime-green coloration consistent with the original description. The scales are distinctly visible, and the snake’s body forms a smooth, curved shape as it rises from the mossy base. The tail portion is also visible and maintains the same texture and color. Although the setting has changed (from a mannequin to a glass dome), the snake’s physical attributes—color, scale pattern, and curvature—are preserved. Therefore, the snake tail retains its original characteristics.",

      "question": "Are the small white gemstones still present in their original positions around the larger emerald stones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no gemstones visible at all. The focus is on the snake, the chandelier, the water, and the moss. There is no jewelry or ornamentation featuring white gemstones surrounding emerald stones. In contrast, Image A showed such gemstones as part of the necklace design. Since these gemstones are entirely absent in Image B, they cannot be in their original positions. This conclusion is based on the absence of any such elements in the current image.",

      "question": "Does the snake tail maintain its original curved path wrapping around the left side of the mannequin's neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snake is positioned inside a glass dome, coiled around the edge of a mossy island near the water. Its body curves upward, but it is not wrapped around a mannequin’s neck at all. The mannequin from Image A is absent. Therefore, the snake’s path is entirely different—it is no longer following the contour of a neck. The environment has shifted from a jewelry display to a contained naturalistic scene, so the snake’s positioning is fundamentally altered. Hence, the original curved path around the neck is not maintained.",
