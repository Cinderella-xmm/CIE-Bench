      "question": "Is Pikachu's body still primarily bright yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu is depicted with a vibrant yellow coloration across its entire body, consistent with its canonical design. The yellow hue is uniform and bright, matching the standard representation of Pikachu in official Pokémon media. This visual cue aligns with world knowledge that Pikachu is famously known for its bright yellow fur. There are no significant deviations in color tone or shading that would suggest a change in primary color. Therefore, based on both visual evidence and established character design, Pikachu’s body remains primarily bright yellow.",

      "question": "Does Pikachu still have pointy ears with black tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu's ears are clearly visible and maintain their characteristic long, pointed shape. Each ear has a distinct black tip, which is a defining feature of Pikachu's appearance in the Pokémon franchise. This matches the original design seen in Image A and confirmed by official artwork and animations. The black tips are sharply defined and positioned at the ends of the ears, reinforcing the accuracy of this trait. Thus, combining visual analysis with world knowledge about Pikachu's iconic look, it is clear that the ears retain their pointy shape and black tips.",

      "question": "Are Pikachu's red cheek patches visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu's cheeks display two prominent circular red patches, one on each side of its face. These are consistent with Pikachu’s well-known physical traits, where the red cheeks are associated with its ability to store electricity. The red color is vivid and clearly distinguishable from the yellow fur, and they are positioned symmetrically. This matches both the original design (as seen in Image A) and the established canon of Pikachu’s appearance. Therefore, based on visual confirmation and background knowledge, the red cheek patches are indeed visible.",

      "question": "Does Pikachu retain black eyes and a smiling mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu has large, round black eyes with white highlights, which are typical of its cartoonish, expressive style. The mouth is open in a wide, joyful smile, showing pink inner lips and a cheerful expression. This facial structure is consistent with Pikachu’s classic depiction across various media. Comparing with Image A, the same eye and mouth features are present, indicating continuity in design. The smiling mouth suggests happiness or excitement, which fits Pikachu’s generally friendly and energetic personality. Hence, Pikachu retains both black eyes and a smiling mouth as per both visual cues and established character design.",

      "question": "Does Pikachu retain its basic limb structure with the same yellow color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu has two arms and two legs, all colored in the same bright yellow as the rest of its body. The limbs are proportioned similarly to the original design—short arms with rounded hands and small feet. The yellow coloration is consistent throughout, without any deviation in hue or pattern. This aligns with the canonical depiction of Pikachu, as seen in Image A and across official Pokémon content. The limb structure supports Pikachu’s bipedal stance and playful movements. Therefore, based on visual inspection and knowledge of Pikachu’s anatomy, it retains its basic limb structure and yellow coloring.",
