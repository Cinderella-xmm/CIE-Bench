      "question": "Are two stone columns visible on the left and right sides of the background, framing the landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a classical architectural setting with two prominent stone columns positioned symmetrically on the left and right sides. These columns are detailed with ornate golden capitals and support an entablature above, framing a painted landscape scene that includes distant hills and sky. This architectural arrangement is typical of Renaissance or neoclassical styles, where columns are used to frame views and add grandeur. The visual cues—such as the texture, shape, and placement of the columns—confirm their presence and function in framing the background. Therefore, based on visual evidence and architectural knowledge, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Are both hands positioned in the lap, supporting an animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is holding a small white lamb with both hands. The hands are clearly placed in the lap area, gently cradling the animal. The positioning is symmetrical, with each hand supporting one side of the lamb’s body. This posture is consistent with a seated figure in a serene pose, common in figurative art. The lamb is not held aloft or away from the body but rests securely in the lap, indicating direct physical support by both hands. Thus, the description matches the visual evidence.",

      "question": "Does the dress have a square neckline without a high collar or round shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B features a distinct square neckline that exposes the shoulders and upper chest. There is no high collar present; instead, the neckline is flat and geometric, forming a clear square shape. The edges are sharp and well-defined, contrasting with a round or rounded neckline. This style aligns with historical fashion elements seen in Renaissance portraiture, particularly in depictions of noblewomen. The absence of any curved or elevated collar structure confirms the square design. Hence, the description accurately reflects the visual details.",

      "question": "Are there two horizontal bands—one across the chest and one at the waist—on the dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the dress in Image B, there are indeed two horizontal decorative bands. One is located across the chest, just below the square neckline, and another is positioned at the waistline. Both bands are gold in color and appear to be part of the dress's trim, adding contrast to the green fabric. These bands are consistent in width and placement, suggesting intentional design symmetry. This detail is typical of period-inspired costumes, where horizontal accents emphasize the torso and waist. The visual evidence supports the presence of both bands.",

      "question": "Is there a necklace with a rectangular pendant hanging from a thin chain at the center of the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject wears a necklace that consists of a thin gold chain with a pendant centered on the chest. However, the pendant is not rectangular—it is circular or oval-shaped with a red gemstone and a small drop beneath it. The shape does not match the description of a rectangular pendant. While the chain is thin and centrally placed, the pendant's form deviates from the specified geometry. Therefore, based on the visual characteristics and comparison with standard jewelry forms, the answer must be negative.",

      "question": "Is the subject’s head turned slightly forward, with eyes looking directly at the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B has her head oriented straight forward, facing the viewer directly. Her gaze is fixed and centered, with large, expressive eyes that engage the viewer. There is no noticeable tilt or turn of the head to either side; it remains aligned with the central axis of the composition. This frontal positioning is common in portrait-style figures, especially stylized collectible figurines, to create a sense of connection. The symmetry and alignment confirm that the head is neither rotated nor angled, and the eyes are directed straight ahead.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sleeves in Image B are long and extend from the shoulders down to the wrists. At the shoulder area, they exhibit a pronounced puffed or rounded shape, creating volume and fullness. This style is characteristic of historical European fashion, particularly in Renaissance or Baroque attire, where padded or gathered sleeves were fashionable. The puffing is most evident at the top, tapering slightly toward the forearm. This visual feature is clearly present and matches the description provided.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beyond the stone columns, the background depicts a painted landscape that includes rolling hills and distant mountains. These mountain ranges are faintly visible under a blue sky with scattered clouds, situated in the far distance. The perspective suggests depth, with the mountains appearing smaller and less detailed than the foreground elements. This use of landscape painting in the background is typical of classical art settings, where natural scenery enhances the grandeur of the scene. The presence of these mountainous formations is confirmed by visual inspection.",
