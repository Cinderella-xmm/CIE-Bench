      "question": "Does the open umbrella retain its circular canopy shape with visible radial ribs converging at a central hub?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The open umbrella in Image B displays a symmetrical, dome-like structure consistent with a circular canopy. The visual cues show multiple straight lines radiating from a central black dot (the hub) to the outer edge of the canopy, which are characteristic of support ribs in an umbrella. These ribs appear evenly spaced and converge precisely at the center, forming a radial pattern typical of such objects. This structural design is standard for umbrellas to maintain shape and stability when open. Therefore, based on the visible geometry and symmetry, the canopy maintains a circular form with radial ribs converging at a central hub.",

      "question": "Is the closed umbrella present with a black casing, wrist strap, and metallic tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the closed umbrella is positioned diagonally in the lower-left corner. It is encased in a black fabric sleeve, which is typical for compact umbrellas to protect the canopy and shaft. A black wrist strap is visibly attached near the handle end, allowing for easy carrying. At the tip of the folded umbrella, a shiny, silver-colored metallic component is present, likely serving as a cap or end piece. These features—black casing, wrist strap, and metallic tip—are all consistent with common umbrella designs. Thus, all three elements are clearly visible and identifiable.",

      "question": "Is the starlit sky with visible stars and nebulae still present as the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The upper portion of the open umbrella in Image B shows a dark, deep-space scene filled with numerous small white dots representing stars. There are also swirling patterns of blue and purple hues that resemble nebulae, commonly found in astronomical imagery. This cosmic backdrop is consistent across the entire top section of the canopy, suggesting a deliberate artistic choice to depict a night sky. The presence of these celestial features confirms that the starlit sky with stars and nebulae remains a dominant background element.",

      "question": "Is the scene composed with flowers in the foreground, a hill in the midground, and the sky in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a layered composition. In the foreground, there are clusters of yellow coneflowers and red poppies, clearly positioned closest to the viewer. Behind them, a grassy, elevated landmass resembling a floating island forms the midground, complete with a stylized tree and an apple. Above this, the starry night sky serves as the background. This spatial arrangement follows a typical depth-of-field layout: flowers in front, elevated terrain in the middle, and sky behind. This hierarchical layering supports the conclusion that the scene is structured with distinct foreground, midground, and background elements.",

      "question": "Are the black support ribs visible and extending from the central hub to the edge of the canopy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, several thin, dark lines can be seen radiating outward from the central black dot at the apex of the umbrella. These lines follow the structural framework of the canopy and extend to the perimeter, consistent with the appearance of support ribs. They are uniformly distributed and appear to be part of the umbrella’s internal skeleton, which is necessary for maintaining shape. Their visibility is enhanced by the contrast against the colorful printed design, making them clearly distinguishable. Therefore, the black support ribs are indeed visible and extend from the central hub to the edge.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower portion of the umbrella’s canopy features vibrant floral elements. On the left side, bright yellow flowers with dark centers and elongated petals are clearly identifiable as coneflowers (Rudbeckia). On the right side, vivid red flowers with cup-shaped blooms and green stems are consistent with poppies. These flowers are positioned in the lower third of the image, placing them in the foreground relative to the floating island and sky. Their detailed rendering and placement confirm their presence as key components of the foreground scenery.",
