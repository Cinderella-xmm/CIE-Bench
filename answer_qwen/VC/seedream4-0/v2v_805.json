      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'STORY PAGES' is not visible at all. The image shows a snow globe with an open book inside, placed on a shelf in a cozy library-like setting. There is no text present above the book within the snow globe or elsewhere in the scene. Therefore, based on visual inspection and common knowledge about how such scenes are composed (e.g., text typically appears in logos or titles), we can conclude that the text 'STORY PAGES' is absent. This contrasts with Image A, which clearly displays the text 'STORY PAGES' in uppercase serif font above a stylized book. However, since the question pertains only to Image B, and no such text exists there, the answer must be 'No'.",

      "question": "Does the book have a visible spine and two cover edges forming an open structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book inside the snow globe is depicted as open, with two pages visible. It has a dark-colored spine that connects the two covers, and both left and right cover edges are clearly defined, forming a typical open book structure. The spine is positioned vertically in the center, and the covers extend outward symmetrically, consistent with real-world book anatomy. While the book is stylized and small, the structural elements of a spine and two cover edges are discernible. In contrast, Image A shows a simplified line-art representation of an open book with a central spine and two symmetrical sides, but it is more abstract. However, for Image B, the presence of these features is confirmed by visual cues and common understanding of book design.",

      "question": "Are there multiple curved horizontal lines on both left and right sides of the book representing stacked pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the open book inside the snow globe has several horizontal lines on both the left and right pages, suggesting text or page lines. These lines are straight rather than curved, and they are evenly spaced, resembling printed lines of text rather than curved representations of stacked pages. Curved horizontal lines would imply a layered or fanned effect of pages, which is not present here. Instead, the lines are flat and parallel, indicating written content. In Image A, the book illustration uses curved horizontal lines to represent stacked pages, which is a stylistic choice to suggest depth. But in Image B, the lines are straight and represent text, not page layers. Thus, the feature described in the question does not match the visual evidence in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'STORY PAGES' is not present at all. Therefore, there is no textual element above the book to serve as a reference point for vertical or horizontal alignment. The book inside the snow globe is centered within the globe itself, but since there is no text above it, the condition of being 'beneath the text' cannot be satisfied. In Image A, the book is indeed centered beneath the text 'STORY PAGES', both horizontally and vertically, creating a balanced composition. However, since Image B lacks this text entirely, the alignment condition fails. Hence, the answer is 'No' based on the absence of the required textual context.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book inside the snow globe is rendered in shades of beige and black, with the pages appearing off-white and the cover dark. The surrounding environment includes warm tones from the lamp and wooden shelves, but there is no dark navy blue color used for the book or any text. The background is not light beige eitherâ€”it is a complex scene with wood, books, and lighting effects. In contrast, Image A features a dark navy blue book and text on a light beige background, which matches the description. However, Image B does not share this color scheme; instead, it uses naturalistic colors appropriate for a realistic scene. Therefore, the color description does not apply to Image B.",
