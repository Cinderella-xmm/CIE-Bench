      "question": "Are the dark wooden beams forming geometric patterns on the facades of the buildings clearly visible and structurally accurate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings exhibit a half-timbered architectural style, which is characterized by exposed dark wooden beams forming geometric patterns against lighter infill panels. These beams are clearly visible across multiple structures, particularly on the left and right sides of the image. The patterns appear consistent with traditional European half-timbered construction, where the timber frames are arranged in vertical and diagonal configurations. The visual clarity and structural alignment of these beams suggest they are accurately depicted, even though the scene has been altered with a snow globe effect. This effect does not obscure the beam patterns but rather reflects them within the sphere, maintaining their visibility. Comparing to Image A, the same architectural features are present and accurately represented, confirming that the beams are both visible and structurally accurate in Image B.",

      "question": "Do the buildings feature steeply pitched gabled roofs with dormer windows positioned at regular intervals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings have steeply pitched gabled roofs, which is typical of traditional Alsatian architecture seen in places like Strasbourg or Colmar. The rooflines are sharply angled, and several dormer windows are visible, protruding from the slopes. However, upon closer inspection, the dormer windows do not appear to be uniformly spaced or regularly positioned across all buildings. Some roofs have dormers, while others do not, and their placement varies. The presence of dormers is evident, but their arrangement lacks consistency. In Image A, the same buildings show similar roof shapes and dormers, but again, their spacing is irregular. Thus, while the roofs are steep and gabled, the dormers are not positioned at regular intervals. Therefore, the answer must reflect this inconsistency.",

      "question": "Is there a pedestrian bridge spanning the canal in the mid-ground, connecting the two sides of the street?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bridge is visible in the mid-ground, crossing over the canal. It appears to be a low-lying structure with railings, and people can be seen walking across it, indicating its use as a pedestrian bridge. The bridge connects the two banks of the canal, linking the streets on either side. This is consistent with the original scene in Image A, where the same bridge is present and functional. The addition of the snow globe effect in Image B does not obscure the bridge; instead, it reflects the bridge inside the sphere, further confirming its presence. Therefore, based on visual cues and contextual knowledge of such urban layouts, the bridge is indeed present and serves its purpose.",

      "question": "Does the canal surface reflect the surrounding buildings and sky with clear, mirror-like fidelity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the canal surface shows reflections of the buildings and sky, but the clarity is compromised by the presence of the large glass sphere (snow globe) in the foreground. The reflection within the sphere is distorted due to the curvature of the glass, and the liquid inside (amber-colored) adds another layer of refraction. While parts of the canal outside the sphere appear calm and reflective, the overall reflection is not mirror-like due to the interference from the globe. In contrast, Image A shows a pristine, undisturbed water surface with sharp, symmetrical reflections of the buildings and sky. The distortion in Image B reduces the fidelity of the reflection. Therefore, despite some reflective qualities, the mirror-like fidelity is not maintained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large building on the right side features balconies with horizontal wooden railings. Along these railings, small rectangular planters are visible, filled with green foliage and yellow flowers. These flower boxes are clearly present and aligned with the balcony structure. The reflection in the snow globe also shows these planters, reinforcing their presence. Comparing to Image A, the same building has identical flower boxes, confirming that they are a real feature of the architecture. The editing in Image B does not remove or obscure these details; they remain visible both directly and in the reflection. Hence, the flower boxes are indeed present and contain green plants.",

      "question": "Are stone bases and metal railings present along the canal edges beneath the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the canal edges are lined with stone masonry, forming solid foundations beneath the buildings. Metal railings are installed along the walkways adjacent to the water, providing safety and separation between pedestrians and the canal. These railings are visible on both sides of the canal, especially near the bridge and along the pathways. The stone bases are weathered, suggesting age and durability, consistent with historical urban infrastructure. In Image A, the same stone bases and metal railings are present, confirming their authenticity. The editing in Image B, including the snow globe, does not alter these structural elements. Therefore, both stone bases and metal railings are clearly visible and accurately represented.",

      "question": "Are the windows arranged in vertical and horizontal lines on the facades, matching the timber frame divisions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows on the buildings are aligned with the timber frame structure. The half-timbered design divides the fa√ßade into rectangular sections, and the windows are placed within these divisions, following both vertical and horizontal alignments. For example, on the building to the left, the windows are evenly spaced and correspond to the timber beams. Similarly, the building on the right has windows that align with the framework. This pattern is consistent with traditional half-timbered architecture, where windows are integrated into the structural grid. In Image A, the same alignment is observed, confirming that the window placement matches the timber frame divisions. Even with the snow globe effect in Image B, the window arrangement remains clear and accurate.",
