    "Question": "Q1: Is the triangular panel structure across the midfoot preserved in shape and spatial arrangement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe appears to be a meticulously carved wooden sculpture of a Salomon Speedcross model. Despite the material change from fabric and synthetic materials to wood, the triangular panel structure across the midfoot is clearly visible and retains its original geometric form and spatial arrangement. The three prominent triangular overlays are precisely replicated in the wood carving, maintaining their alignment, size, and positioning relative to each other and the rest of the shoe's structure. This preservation suggests that the artist carefully followed the original design’s blueprint, ensuring structural fidelity even in a non-functional medium. Given that these panels are iconic design elements of the Salomon Speedcross series, their accurate replication in the wooden version confirms that they are preserved in both shape and spatial arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the 'SPEEDCROSS' text positioned along the lateral side of the shoe in the same location and orientation as in the original?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 'SPEEDCROSS' text is visible along the lateral side of the shoe, running diagonally across the upper part near the laces. Although the material has changed to wood, the text is engraved into the surface with the same font style and orientation as seen in typical Salomon Speedcross models. The placement—just above the midfoot lacing area and aligned with the direction of the shoe’s profile—is consistent with the original design. Comparing this to Image A (the original shoe), where the 'SPEEDCROSS' text is printed on a fabric band with colored accents (yellow, blue, red), the wooden version replicates the text’s position and angle accurately, albeit without color. The engraving preserves the relative height, slant, and spacing, indicating faithful reproduction. Therefore, despite the medium change, the text remains in the same location and orientation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the Salomon logos present on both the heel counter and tongue tab in their original positions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Salomon logo is visible on the heel counter, embossed into the wood in the same location and orientation as it would appear on the original shoe. The 'S' logo is also present on the tongue tab, again engraved in the same spot as it would be on the textile version. These placements align with standard branding conventions for Salomon shoes, where the 'S' logo is consistently placed on both the heel and tongue. While the original image (Image A) shows these logos as stitched or printed labels, the wooden version uses relief carving to replicate them. The spatial accuracy is maintained—both logos are in their expected anatomical positions on the shoe. Thus, the logos are preserved in their original positions, even though their presentation method differs due to the medium.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the lacing system maintained with the same number and spacing of eyelets as in the original?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lacing system is clearly represented with multiple eyelets arranged vertically along the upper. By counting the eyelets, we observe five pairs (ten individual holes), which matches the typical configuration of the Salomon Speedcross model. The spacing between the eyelets appears uniform and consistent with the original design, suggesting careful attention to detail by the sculptor. In comparison to Image A, the original shoe features the same number and spacing of eyelets, allowing for a secure lace-up fit. The wooden version replicates this functional aspect structurally, even though the laces themselves are not present—they are implied by the carved loops. Since the eyelet count and spacing are identical to the original, the lacing system is effectively maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the outsole lug pattern and the 'contagrip' text preserved in their original positions and shapes?",
    "explanation": "The outsole of the wooden shoe in Image B displays a detailed lug pattern that closely mirrors the aggressive tread of the original Salomon Speedcross model. The lugs are shaped and spaced identically to those in Image A, with deep grooves and distinct blocky patterns designed for traction. Additionally, the 'contagrip' text is engraved into the outsole near the toe, in the same location and font style as on the original shoe. This text is typically found on the lateral side of the outsole in Salomon models, and its presence here confirms faithful replication. The depth and curvature of the engraving match the original’s placement, indicating that both the lug pattern and the text have been preserved in their original positions and shapes, despite being rendered in wood rather than rubber.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the reinforced toe cap shape and the embossed 'S' logo preserved in the same location and form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toe cap is visibly reinforced, with a robust, slightly raised structure that mimics the protective rubber cap found on the original Salomon Speedcross shoe. The shape is rounded and durable-looking, matching the original’s design intent for durability and impact resistance. Furthermore, the embossed 'S' logo is present on the toe cap, located in the same position as on the original shoe—centered on the front tip. The depth and contour of the logo are consistent with the original’s branding. Even though the material is wood instead of rubber, the sculptural representation maintains the exact form and placement of both the toe cap and the logo. This indicates a high degree of fidelity to the original design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the 'LT LIGHT WEIGHT MIDSOLE' label present in the same location and shape near the heel?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, near the heel of the shoe, there is an engraved label that reads 'LT LIGHT WEIGHT MIDSOLE', enclosed within a red-colored rectangular outline. This placement corresponds exactly to the original shoe’s design, where this label is typically located on the lateral side of the midsole, just behind the heel counter. The shape of the label—a small rectangle with angled corners—and the text layout are preserved. Although the original version (Image A) uses a printed label with red background and white text, the wooden version replicates the same dimensions, positioning, and textual content through engraving. The inclusion of this detail demonstrates that the artist paid close attention to even minor branding elements, ensuring that the label is present in the same location and shape as in the original.",
    "answer": "Yes"
