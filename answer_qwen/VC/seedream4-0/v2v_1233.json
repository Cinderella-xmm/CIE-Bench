      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patient's arm is shown with a visible IV catheter inserted into the forearm, and a blue tube extends from the catheter up to the IV bag labeled 'BLUE IV'. The tubing is clearly depicted in the comic-style illustration, running from the patient’s arm to the IV bag hanging on the stand. This visual continuity, combined with common medical knowledge that IV therapy requires a continuous connection between the patient and the fluid bag, confirms that the patient is indeed connected to the IV drip. Even though the image is stylized, the key elements (tubing, catheter, and IV bag) are present and logically connected.",

      "question": "Is the nurse still interacting with medical supplies on the cart near the patient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nurse is positioned beside a medical cart that contains various items such as trays, containers, and possibly syringes or medications. Her hands are shown reaching toward the cart, suggesting active engagement with the supplies. The posture and hand placement indicate interaction, consistent with typical nursing behavior during patient care. Although the image is rendered in a stylized, pop-art manner, the spatial arrangement and gesture imply ongoing interaction with the equipment on the cart. This aligns with real-world medical procedures where nurses frequently access supplies while attending to patients.",

      "question": "Are the medical monitors still visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two medical monitors are clearly visible in the background, mounted on the wall behind the patient. Both display vital signs, including ECG waveforms and numerical values such as '75' and '85', which resemble heart rate and oxygen saturation readings. These monitors are stylized but retain their recognizable form and function. Their presence in the same location as in a realistic hospital setting supports the conclusion that they are still visible. The artistic style does not obscure their identity or position; instead, it emphasizes them through bold outlines and color contrasts, making them prominent features of the scene.",

      "question": "Is the patient still lying in a relaxed position with his eyes closed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patient is depicted lying on a hospital bed with his head resting on a pillow. His eyes are closed, and his facial expression appears calm and passive, consistent with a resting or sedated state. His body is positioned horizontally, with arms relaxed at his sides, indicating a reclined and comfortable posture. Despite the exaggerated lines and colors typical of comic art, the overall pose remains unchanged from a standard depiction of a patient receiving treatment. This aligns with common medical scenarios where patients remain still and unconscious or asleep during IV therapy.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the IV stand is clearly visible adjacent to the patient's bed. It is a tall metal pole with a hook holding the IV bag, and the tubing runs from the bag down to the patient’s arm. The stand’s placement is consistent with standard hospital practice, where IV stands are positioned close to the patient for easy access and monitoring. The comic-style rendering preserves the structural details of the stand and its proximity to the bed, confirming that it remains in the correct location relative to the patient. There is no indication of movement or repositioning in the image.",
