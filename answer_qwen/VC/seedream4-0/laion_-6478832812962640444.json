      "question": "Is the toe box of the boot rounded?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the front portion of the boot in Image B, the toe box appears to have a squared-off shape rather than a rounded one. The edges are sharp and angular, especially noticeable at the tip where the boot transitions from the vamp to the sole. This is consistent with the design of many modern cowboy boots that feature a 'square toe' style. Based on visual cues, the toe box does not curve inward or outward smoothly as would be expected in a rounded toe design. Therefore, the conclusion is that the toe box is not rounded.",

      "question": "Does the boot have a V-shaped opening at the top of the shaft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the shaft in Image B, there is a distinct V-shaped cutout that forms the opening of the boot. This is a classic feature of traditional cowboy boots, designed to allow easier entry and provide a stylistic element. The V-shape is clearly visible and symmetrical, with the two sides of the shaft converging toward the center at the top. This design is consistent with standard cowboy boot construction. Thus, the presence of a V-shaped opening is confirmed.",

      "question": "Is there a continuous white piping running vertically along the outer side of the shaft from the heel to the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot has a metallic, reflective surface with no visible white piping along the outer side of the shaft. Instead, the decorative elements are etched into the metal surface, appearing as dark lines that contrast with the shiny material. There is no evidence of a continuous white strip or thread-like piping running from the heel up to the top. In contrast, Image A shows such white piping, but Image B lacks it entirely. This absence suggests that the piping was removed or omitted in the edited version. Therefore, the answer is no.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are decorative patterns present on both the upper shaft and the vamp area of the boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot features intricate, raised decorative patterns that run along the entire length of the shaft and extend down into the vamp area (the front part of the boot covering the instep). These patterns include geometric shapes and stylized floral motifs, typical of Western boot designs, but rendered here in a metallic, embossed form. The designs are clearly visible and continuous across both regions. This confirms that decorative patterns are present on both the upper shaft and the vamp. Even though the material is metallic and not leather, the design intent aligns with traditional cowboy boot ornamentation.",

      "question": "Is there a distinct heel block elevating the rear of the boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The heel of the boot in Image B is clearly elevated and structured as a solid block, rising significantly above the sole. It has multiple horizontal layers, giving it a stepped appearance, which is characteristic of a heel block used in cowboy boots for stability and height. This design is functional and aesthetic, providing elevation to the rear of the boot. The heel is visibly separate from the sole and distinctly defined, confirming its presence as a heel block. This is consistent with the purpose of cowboy boots, which often feature a raised heel for riding and balance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the boot in Image B is highly reflective and smooth, with a polished metallic finish. There is no visible texture resembling natural leather grain. Instead, the surface appears uniform and glossy, suggesting a synthetic or metal material. While the boot retains the general shape and decorative style of a leather cowboy boot, the lack of pores, creases, or grain patterns indicates that it is not made of leather. In contrast, Image A shows a boot with a textured surface that mimics real leather. Therefore, the surface in Image B does not exhibit leather-like texture.",
