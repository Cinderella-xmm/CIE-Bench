      "question": "Is the car rendered in its original red color in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is shown from three different angles: front, side, and rear. Across all views, the vehicle maintains a consistent deep red paint finish, which is characteristic of the Ford Mustang's standard color options. There are no visible variations in hue or tone between the views, suggesting that the rendering preserves the original red color uniformly. The lighting appears to be neutral and studio-like, minimizing shadows or reflections that could distort color perception. Based on visual consistency and typical automotive rendering practices, where color fidelity is preserved across multiple angles, it is reasonable to conclude that the car is rendered in its original red color in all views.",

      "question": "Does the front view retain the detailed grille design and Ford emblem in its original position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the front view of Image B, the grille features a black mesh pattern with horizontal slats, which is consistent with the design of the Ford Mustang GT. At the center of the grille, the iconic galloping horse emblem (the Mustang logo) is clearly visible and positioned centrally, as expected in genuine Mustang models. This placement aligns with the brand’s design language, where the emblem is always centered on the grille. The surrounding chrome accents and the overall symmetry further confirm that the grille and emblem are accurately represented in their original positions. No distortion or misalignment is observed, supporting the conclusion that the design elements are faithfully reproduced.",

      "question": "Are the same style and configuration of LED daytime running lights visible in both the front and side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the front view of Image B, the LED daytime running lights (DRLs) are clearly visible as a series of horizontal light bars located above the main headlamp units. These DRLs are illuminated and match the known design of the Mustang GT. In the side view, the DRLs are also visible near the front bumper, but due to the angle, only one side is partially visible. However, the configuration—horizontal bars within the headlight assembly—is consistent with the front view. The side view does not show additional or different DRL configurations, indicating that the same style and layout are maintained. Given that automotive designs maintain consistency across views for branding and safety purposes, the alignment of DRLs in both views supports the conclusion that they are the same.",

      "question": "Do all views show the same specific design and detail of the car’s alloy wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the alloy wheels are visible in all three views: front, side, and rear. The wheels feature a multi-spoke black design with a polished or machined finish at the edges, consistent with the Mustang GT’s performance-oriented wheel style. In the front and side views, the five-spoke pattern is clearly visible, and the red brake calipers behind the spokes confirm high-performance braking components. The rear view also shows the same wheel design, including the spoke pattern and finish. There is no indication of variation in design or detail across the views, suggesting that the rendering maintains consistency in wheel appearance. Since automotive manufacturers use identical wheels across all sides of a vehicle, this uniformity is expected and logically supported by the visual evidence.",

      "question": "Are the body shape and proportions of the Mustang accurately represented in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body shape and proportions of the Mustang in Image B are consistent with the real-world design of the sixth-generation Ford Mustang (2015–2023). The front view shows a wide, aggressive stance with a long hood and short rear deck, characteristic of the Mustang’s classic proportions. The side view reveals a smooth, flowing silhouette with a fastback roofline, sculpted fenders, and a balanced wheelbase. The rear view displays the iconic triple-bar taillights and muscular haunches, along with a properly proportioned trunk and spoiler. All three views maintain continuity in curvature, window lines, and overall dimensions, indicating accurate representation. Additionally, the absence of distortion or scaling errors across views supports the conclusion that the car’s body shape and proportions are faithfully depicted.",
