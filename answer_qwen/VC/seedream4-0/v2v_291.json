      "question": "Does the edited image retain the hippo's large size and wrinkled skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo is depicted in a stylized, cartoonish form with smooth, rounded features and no visible wrinkles. The texture of the skin is simplified and lacks the detailed, rough, and deeply folded appearance characteristic of a real hippopotamus. Instead, it has a soft, matte surface typical of animated or toy-like representations. This contrasts sharply with the realistic, textured skin seen in Image A, where the hippo’s skin shows pronounced folds and natural imperfections. Based on visual cues and world knowledge about animal anatomy and artistic stylization, the edited version clearly deviates from the realistic depiction of the hippo’s size and texture.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the rabbit's small size and upright ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rabbit is shown as a small, upright figure with long, erect ears that are characteristic of a typical rabbit. Its size relative to the hippo is proportionally smaller, consistent with the natural size difference between the two animals. Although the rabbit is stylized with exaggerated features (such as large eyes and rosy cheeks), its overall proportions—especially the upright ears—are preserved. Comparing this to Image A, where the rabbit also has upright ears and appears small next to the hippo, the key traits of size and ear posture are maintained in the edited version, albeit in a more cartoonish style. Thus, despite stylistic changes, the core physical attributes remain intact.",

      "question": "Does the edited image keep the hippo and rabbit positioned close together and oriented towards the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the hippo and the rabbit are standing side by side, facing forward toward the viewer. Their positioning is close and symmetrical within the frame, suggesting companionship or partnership, which aligns with the 'Team Resr' label at the bottom. In contrast, in Image A, the hippo is lying down while the rabbit stands nearby but slightly off to the side, not directly facing the camera. While both images show proximity, Image B emphasizes a frontal, unified stance. The orientation and closeness are preserved in concept, though the pose and framing have been altered for stylistic effect. Therefore, the spatial relationship of being close and facing the viewer is retained in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both characters exhibit a calm and friendly expression. The hippo has a gentle smile and relaxed eyes, while the rabbit has soft, wide eyes and a neutral, peaceful face. These expressions convey serenity and approachability, consistent with the intended mood of the scene. In Image A, the real hippo appears calm and relaxed, lying still with a neutral gaze, and the rabbit seems alert but not agitated. The edited version translates this calmness into a more exaggerated, cute aesthetic, but the emotional tone remains peaceful. Thus, despite the shift in art style, the calm demeanor of both animals is preserved.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain earthy tones that reflect the natural environment of the hippo and rabbit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background with green grass, brown soil, and hints of foliage, all rendered in warm, naturalistic colors such as greens, browns, and yellows. These earthy tones evoke a forest or meadow setting, which is ecologically plausible for both hippos and rabbits, especially in a stylized or fantasy context. Although the scene is framed like a collectible card and includes artificial elements like text and UI bars, the color palette still reflects natural hues. Compared to Image A, which shows a sandy, dry terrain with muted earth tones, Image B uses a broader range of greens and browns but maintains the same general earthy theme. Thus, the use of earthy tones is preserved, even if the environment is idealized.",
