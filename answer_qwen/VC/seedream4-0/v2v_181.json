      "question": "Does the edited image retain the sheep's four-legged body structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep is depicted inside a snow globe and appears stylized or cartoonish. Despite its exaggerated features, it still has four legs visible, positioned symmetrically beneath its body. The legs are short and stubby, consistent with a simplified representation of a sheep, but they are clearly present and support the body in a way that reflects the typical quadrupedal structure of a real sheep. This matches the biological reality of sheep having four legs, even if the artistic style simplifies them. Therefore, the four-legged structure is retained, albeit in a stylized form.",

      "question": "Is the sheep covered in a woolly coat resembling curly fleece?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sheep in Image B has a textured, fluffy appearance on its body, which mimics the look of wool. The surface texture is soft and curly, consistent with the visual characteristics of sheep’s fleece. Although the rendering is cartoon-like and not photorealistic, the design intentionally emulates the woolly coat seen on real sheep. The white, voluminous fur gives the impression of curly fleece, which is a defining trait of sheep. Thus, despite the stylization, the woolly coat is clearly represented.",

      "question": "Are the sheep’s ears, eyes, nose, and mouth clearly visible and positioned in a way consistent with a real sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep has two small, rounded ears placed on top of its head, which is anatomically accurate for a sheep. Its eyes are large and black, positioned symmetrically on either side of the face, though they are stylized to appear cute rather than realistic. The nose is a simple dark oval, and the mouth is a subtle curved line, giving a smiling expression. While these features are simplified and cartoonish, their placement—ears on top, eyes on sides, nose centered, mouth below—matches the general facial anatomy of a real sheep. Therefore, although not lifelike, the facial features are recognizable and positioned consistently with real sheep anatomy.",

      "question": "Does the clock retain a circular face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock in Image B is enclosed within a transparent sphere (snow globe) and has a distinct round shape. The face of the clock is clearly circular, with a golden border and a flat disc-shaped center displaying the numbers and hands. This circular form is consistent with traditional analog clocks and matches common expectations of clock design. Even within the context of the snow globe, the clock maintains its round shape without distortion. Hence, the clock retains a circular face.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the numbers 1 through 12 present on the clock face in a clockwise arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the clock face in Image B, all numbers from 1 to 12 are visible and arranged sequentially around the circumference of the clock. They follow a clockwise order, starting from 12 at the top and progressing to 1, 2, ..., up to 11 before returning to 12. This is standard for analog clocks and aligns with universal timekeeping conventions. There are no missing numbers or irregularities in their placement, confirming that the numbering is complete and correctly oriented.",

      "question": "Are the hour and minute hands visible on the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face clearly shows two hands: a shorter hand pointing toward the 10 and a longer hand pointing toward the 2. These correspond to the hour and minute hands, respectively. The hour hand is thicker and shorter, while the minute hand is thinner and longer, which is consistent with standard clock design. Both hands are clearly visible and positioned on the clock face, indicating the time. Therefore, both hands are present and identifiable.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the clock show the time as 10:10?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hour hand is pointing directly at the 10, and the minute hand is pointing at the 2. On a clock, each number represents five minutes, so the minute hand at 2 indicates 10 minutes past the hour. Since the hour hand is aligned with the 10, this corresponds to 10:10. This time display is common in product photography because it creates a visually pleasing, symmetrical appearance. The clock in Image B accurately displays this time.",

      "question": "Are the sheep and clock positioned close to each other within the same scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the sheep and the clock are contained within the same transparent snow globe. They are placed side by side on a bed of artificial snow inside the globe, with the sheep sitting slightly to the left of the clock. Their proximity is very close, and they share the same enclosed space, suggesting a deliberate composition where they coexist in a single scene. This contrasts with Image A, where the sheep and clock are separate objects in an open environment. However, in Image B, they are clearly grouped together within the same visual context.",
