      "question": "Do the birds retain their original feather patterns including the brown and white colors and striated wing markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds display a consistent feather pattern with distinct brown and white coloration. The wings show clear striated markings, particularly visible in the white bars across the flight feathers, which are characteristic of certain passerine birds like wheatears or similar species. These patterns appear unchanged from typical natural plumage seen in such birds. The visual details—such as the contrast between the warm brown upperparts and the lighter underparts, along with the precise striping on the wings—are preserved. There is no evidence of distortion or alteration in these features. Based on world knowledge, bird plumage patterns are highly stable traits and are typically not modified in realistic editing unless intentionally altered. Since no such modification is evident here, the original feather patterns are retained.",

      "question": "Are the birds still perched on the branch with their beaks open as if singing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both birds are clearly perched on a single branch, maintaining the same posture observed in Image A. Their beaks are open, angled upward, which is a common behavior associated with vocalization in birds, especially during dawn or dusk chorusing. This posture is consistent with the idea that they are singing. The positioning of the feet on the branch and the orientation of the bodies remain identical to what would be expected in a natural scene. Given that birds often sing while perched, and this pose is biologically plausible, the depiction aligns with real-world behavior. No change in posture or action is apparent despite the background shift.",

      "question": "Is the branch still present with the same structure and positioning beneath the birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branch in Image B maintains the same structural form and spatial relationship to the birds as seen in Image A. It extends diagonally from the lower left toward the right, supporting both birds with consistent curvature and thickness. The texture and bark detail appear unaltered, suggesting continuity in the foreground elements. Even though the background has changed dramatically (from sunset to night sky), the branch itself shows no signs of manipulation or repositioning. In nature, such branches serve as stable perches, and there's no reason to expect changes in their physical structure unless edited. Since no such edits are visually detectable, the branch remains consistent.",

      "question": "Are the leaves around the birds still visible with their original shapes and positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green foliage surrounding the birds appears largely unchanged in shape and position compared to Image A. The leaves maintain their natural oval forms and clustered arrangement on the left side of the frame. Lighting differences due to the nighttime setting affect brightness and shadows, but the leaf outlines, density, and placement relative to the birds and branch remain consistent. From a biological standpoint, leaves do not reposition themselves rapidly; thus, any significant change would be unnatural. The absence of deformation or rearrangement suggests that the leaf structure has been preserved, even under different lighting conditions.",

      "question": "Do the birds still exhibit the original lighting effects highlighting their forms despite the background change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the background in Image B has shifted from a golden sunset to a starry night sky, the birds themselves are still illuminated in a way that highlights their forms—particularly the soft glow on their chests and the subtle shading along their backs. This illumination appears to originate from an artificial light source positioned below or behind them, mimicking moonlight or ambient night lighting. While the lighting direction and intensity differ from the warm backlighting of Image A, the effect serves a similar purpose: defining contours and enhancing three-dimensionality. However, the 'original' lighting effects (i.e., those from the sunset) are not preserved; instead, new lighting conditions have been applied to match the nocturnal setting. Therefore, while the birds are still well-lit and detailed, the specific lighting effects from the original image have been replaced.",
