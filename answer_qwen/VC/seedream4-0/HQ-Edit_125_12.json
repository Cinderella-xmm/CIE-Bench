      "question": "Is the intricate engraved floral and scrollwork pattern on the teapot body still visible and intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is depicted within a packaging box that features a printed image of the teapot on its front. The printed image shows the teapot with detailed engraving patterns consistent with floral and scrollwork designs, which are characteristic of ornate silverware. While the actual physical teapot inside the box is not directly visible, the printed representation on the box is highly detailed and accurately reflects the design elements seen in Image A. Based on this visual cue and common packaging practices—where product images are designed to faithfully represent the item—the intricate engraved patterns are likely preserved and intact. Furthermore, the level of detail in the print suggests that the original design was carefully documented and reproduced, implying that the real teapot maintains these features.",

      "question": "Does the teapot retain its rounded body, flared base, and domed lid with finial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging displays a clear image of the teapot on its front panel. This image shows a teapot with a distinct rounded body, a flared base, and a domed lid topped with a finial—features that are consistent with the design seen in Image A. These structural elements are central to the teapot’s classical aesthetic and are typically preserved in high-quality reproductions or luxury items. Since the packaging is designed to showcase the product accurately, it is reasonable to infer that the actual teapot retains these key architectural features. Additionally, such forms are integral to traditional teapot design and would be unlikely to be altered without significant reason, especially in a premium product like 'Earl Grey Elegance'.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the reflective silver-metallic surface of the teapot preserved, showing clear highlights and reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The printed image on the packaging in Image B depicts the teapot with a polished, reflective surface that includes highlights and subtle reflections, suggesting a metallic finish. However, since the image is a printed representation rather than a direct photograph of the actual object, we cannot confirm the true reflectivity of the teapot's surface from this view alone. That said, the choice of a glossy, high-fidelity print indicates that the original teapot has a reflective quality worth showcasing. In luxury goods packaging, such details are often emphasized to convey authenticity and craftsmanship. Therefore, while the reflection is not directly observable on the physical teapot in Image B, the printed image implies that the reflective silver-metallic surface is preserved and intended to be a key feature of the product.",

      "question": "Are the spout and both handles positioned and shaped as in the original image, maintaining their curved forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the printed image on the box clearly shows the teapot with a gracefully curved spout and two handles—one for pouring and one for holding—both of which match the curvature and positioning observed in Image A. The symmetry and ergonomic design of the handles and spout are typical of traditional teapots and are crucial for functionality and aesthetics. Since the packaging image is meant to represent the actual product accurately, it is logical to conclude that the real teapot maintains these exact forms. Any deviation would likely be noted in marketing materials, but here the depiction is consistent with the original, suggesting fidelity in design.",

      "question": "Are the decorative ridges and edge banding around the lid and base still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The printed image on the packaging in Image B shows fine detailing around the lid and base of the teapot, including what appears to be decorative ridges and edge banding. These elements are visible in the rendering of the teapot on the box, particularly along the rim of the lid and the foot of the base. Given that such details are commonly highlighted in premium product imagery to emphasize craftsmanship, and since they are also present in Image A, it is safe to infer that the actual teapot retains these features. Packaging for luxury items typically aims to mirror the product’s true appearance, so the presence of these details in the print strongly suggests they are physically present on the teapot itself.",
