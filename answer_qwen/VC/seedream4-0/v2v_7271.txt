    "Question": "Q1: Is the word 'LAUNDROMAT' clearly visible in white capital letters on a teal background above the entrance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sign above the entrance is constructed from LEGO bricks. The word 'LAUNDROMAT' is spelled out using white LEGO pieces with raised lettering, set against a teal-colored LEGO brick background. This matches the description of white capital letters on a teal background. The font and spacing are consistent with typical LEGO signage design, and the sign is positioned directly above the glass door entrance, as expected for a laundromat. Based on visual inspection and world knowledge of LEGO construction, the sign is clearly legible and properly placed.",
