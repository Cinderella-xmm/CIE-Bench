      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual content shows a golden statue resembling an Oscar award on the left side and a trophy with the 'RISING STAR' logo on the right. The text 'SEARCH FOR A STAR' is not visible anywhere in this image. Based on world knowledge, 'SEARCH FOR A STAR' was a previous branding used by Sumo Digital for talent initiatives, but in this edited image, only the 'RISING STAR' branding is present. Therefore, the absence of the 'SEARCH FOR A STAR' text can be confirmed through direct observation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly displays the 'RISING STAR' logo prominently on the right side, integrated into a trophy design. The text is stylized with a golden star in the center, matching the branding associated with Sumo Digital's Rising Star program. This is consistent with known promotional materials from Sumo Digital, where 'RISING STAR' is used to denote their talent development initiative. The presence of this text is unmistakable due to its size, color contrast, and central placement.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'SUMO DIGITAL' logo is visible beneath the 'RISING STAR' logo on the right side of the image. It features the red 'S' emblem and the words 'SUMO DIGITAL' in a clean, modern font. This branding is consistent with Sumo Digital’s corporate identity, and its inclusion here aligns with their use of logos in official promotions. The text is clearly legible and positioned directly under the main 'RISING STAR' title.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The phrase 'Character Art Directory 2018' is displayed across the lower portion of the image in large, metallic-style lettering. It spans horizontally between the golden statue and the trophy, making it highly visible. The font style and placement suggest it is a title or subtitle for the event or publication being advertised. Given the context of Sumo Digital’s annual art directories, this text is consistent with their past publications.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Character Art Directory 2018' is positioned centrally in the lower third of the image, spanning from near the base of the golden statue to the base of the trophy. While it is not perfectly aligned with the exact geometric center due to the asymmetrical layout of the two objects (statue on the left, trophy on the right), it appears balanced and visually centered relative to the overall composition. In graphic design, such positioning often aims for visual equilibrium rather than strict mathematical centering. Thus, it can be considered horizontally centered in a compositional sense.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'RISING STAR' logo is clearly visible above the 'Character Art Directory 2018' text, as part of the trophy on the right. However, the 'SEARCH FOR A STAR' logo is not present in this image at all. Therefore, while the 'RISING STAR' logo is above the text, the 'SEARCH FOR A STAR' logo is absent. Since the question asks about both logos collectively, and one is missing, the answer must reflect that both are not present above the text.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'RISING STAR' logo is placed at the top of the trophy, and directly below it, on the wooden base of the trophy, is the 'SUMO DIGITAL' logo, including the red 'S' symbol and the company name. This vertical arrangement is consistent with branding practices where parent company logos are placed below program-specific titles. The physical structure of the trophy supports this hierarchical placement, confirming that the 'Sumo Digital' logo is indeed beneath the 'Rising Star' logo.",
