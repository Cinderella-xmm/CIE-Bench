    "Question": "Q1: Is the subject depicted in a horizontal plank pose, supported by hands and toes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is a LEGO minifigure displayed inside a glass case. The figure is standing upright on a base, not in a plank pose. A horizontal plank pose requires the body to be parallel to the ground, supported by hands and toes, with the back straight. The LEGO figure is clearly in a vertical stance, with no indication of being in a plank position. Therefore, based on visual cues and the definition of a plank pose, this condition is not met.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the subject wearing a sleeveless tank top and shorts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO minifigure is dressed in a black sleeveless top and black shorts. This matches the description of a sleeveless tank top and shorts. While the clothing is stylized due to the LEGO format, the design clearly corresponds to these garments. Thus, the subject is wearing attire consistent with the description.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the background maintain a clean and minimalistic aesthetic?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a neutral, light-colored surface with soft lighting and no distracting elements. The display case itself is simple and transparent, focusing attention on the LEGO figure and tiger. There are no cluttered or complex elements in the background, contributing to a clean and minimalistic appearance. This aligns with common design principles for showcasing collectibles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the subject's muscles visibly defined, indicating physical strength?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is a LEGO minifigure, which has a blocky, stylized design typical of LEGO figures. These figures do not have anatomical details such as visible muscle definition. Unlike real human subjects, LEGO figures lack realistic musculature. Therefore, despite the original image (Image A) showing a muscular person, the LEGO version does not exhibit defined muscles.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the subject looking upward, conveying focus and determination?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO minifigure has a fixed facial expression with eyes looking forward, not upward. LEGO figures typically have static expressions, and there is no indication of upward gaze or emotional intensity like focus or determination. In contrast, Image A shows a human subject with an upward gaze, suggesting concentration. However, in Image B, the direction of gaze does not match the description. Thus, the subject is not looking upward.",
    "answer": "No"
