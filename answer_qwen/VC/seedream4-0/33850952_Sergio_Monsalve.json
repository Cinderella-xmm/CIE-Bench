      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building facade displays a series of repeating horizontal layers that form a wavy, organic structure. Each level appears to be separated by pronounced ridges and undulations in the surface, creating clear visual divisions between floors. By counting these distinct horizontal bands from bottom to top, we can identify at least eight such levels. These levels are consistent with the architectural design of high-rise buildings that feature tiered balconies or terraces. The presence of multiple rows of windows and balcony-like structures further supports the identification of separate floor levels. Even though the image has been artistically altered with surreal elements like glowing textures and tentacle-like protrusions, the underlying structural layout still maintains the vertical stacking pattern seen in typical multi-story buildings. Therefore, based on visual cues and architectural logic, there are indeed at least eight distinct horizontal levels.",

      "question": "Is there a transparent railing structure visible on each balcony, positioned directly outside the windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balconies appear to have glass railings, which are consistent with modern architectural designs. The transparent nature of the railings is suggested by their reflective and see-through appearance, allowing visibility into the interior spaces while maintaining safety. Although the image has been heavily stylized with bioluminescent effects and organic textures, the outline of the railings remains discernible—especially in areas where they intersect with the glowing lines and where reflections are visible. In comparison to Image A (the original), the transparent railing structure is clearly present in both images, indicating it was part of the original design. The editing process did not remove or obscure this feature but rather enhanced its surroundings with fantastical lighting. Thus, based on visual evidence and architectural consistency, transparent railings are visible on each balcony.",

      "question": "Are the windows on each floor arranged in a continuous, curved arc along the building’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows follow a flowing, non-linear arrangement that conforms to the undulating shape of the building's exterior. Each window is embedded within a curved segment of the facade, forming a smooth, wave-like arc across the horizontal plane of each floor. This curvature is consistent across multiple levels and is accentuated by the lighting and texture modifications in the edited version. The design mimics biomorphic architecture, where forms resemble natural organisms. When compared to Image A, the original structure already features curved window placements, and the edit preserves this characteristic while adding iridescent scales and tendrils. The continuity of the arcs is maintained despite the surreal enhancements, suggesting that the windows were intentionally designed to follow the building’s organic contours. Hence, the windows are indeed arranged in a continuous, curved arc on each floor.",

      "question": "Can furniture items (such as chairs or tables) be seen inside the rooms through the windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interiors visible through the windows are dimly lit and partially obscured by curtains and the artistic overlay of glowing effects. However, upon close inspection, faint silhouettes resembling chairs and possibly small tables can be detected in some of the lower-level rooms, particularly near the balconies. These shapes are subtle but consistent with typical residential or hotel room furnishings. Comparing with Image A, the original image shows clearer views of interior spaces where furniture is more distinctly visible—such as white chairs and small tables on balconies. The edits in Image B have introduced visual noise (like light streaks and textures), which reduces clarity but does not completely eliminate the presence of furniture. Based on both visual cues and prior knowledge of how such buildings are furnished, it is reasonable to conclude that furniture items are present and can be discerned, albeit faintly, through the windows.",

      "question": "Is the building viewed from a low-angle side perspective, showing its height and curving profile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the building from a perspective that emphasizes its verticality and lateral curvature. The angle of view is clearly upward-looking, capturing the building's towering presence and the sweeping, wave-like flow of its facade. This low-angle shot enhances the sense of scale and highlights the dynamic, sculptural form of the architecture. The alignment of the balconies and windows recedes into the distance, reinforcing the depth and height of the structure. While the surreal elements (like glowing tendrils and iridescent surfaces) add fantasy to the scene, they do not alter the fundamental viewpoint. Comparing with Image A confirms that the original photograph was also taken from a similar low-angle side perspective, focusing on the building’s profile. Therefore, the perspective in Image B remains consistent with a low-angle side view that showcases the building’s height and curving silhouette.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the relationship between windows and balconies appears to be one-to-one in most cases. Each window is followed by a recessed or protruding balcony section that aligns horizontally with it, forming a repeating pattern across the facade. The balconies are integrated into the undulating design, with each one positioned just beyond the window area. Although the editing introduces fantastical elements such as root-like structures and glowing edges, the spatial organization of the original architectural layout is preserved. In Image A, this alignment is even more evident—the balconies are clearly defined and consistently placed outside each window. The edit does not disrupt this alignment but rather overlays additional textures onto the same structural framework. Therefore, based on both the visual structure and architectural logic, each window does have a corresponding balcony immediately outside it, aligned horizontally.",
