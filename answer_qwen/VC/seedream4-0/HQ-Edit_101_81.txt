    "Question": "Q1: Is the lifted foot placed on the inner thigh of the standing leg?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is performing a yoga pose that resembles the Tree Pose (Vrksasana). The visual cues show her right leg bent with the foot raised and placed against the inner thigh of the left standing leg. This placement is consistent with the standard execution of Tree Pose, where the sole of the foot rests on the inner thigh or calf (but not the knee) to maintain balance. The positioning appears anatomically correct and aligned with traditional yoga practice. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and knowledge of yoga poses, the lifted foot is indeed placed on the inner thigh.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the hands pressed together in prayer position directly above the head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's arms are raised above her head, and her palms are pressed together in a prayer-like gesture (Anjali Mudra). The hands are positioned directly above her head, forming a straight line from the shoulders through the arms to the hands. This is a common variation of the Tree Pose, where the hands are brought overhead to enhance balance and focus. The alignment and posture match the description of hands in prayer position above the head. Thus, based on both visual observation and typical yoga form, this detail is accurate.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the woman standing on a flat rectangular yoga mat?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the woman standing on a dark gray, flat, rectangular object that is clearly identifiable as a yoga mat. The mat lies horizontally on a wooden floor and is centered beneath her feet. Its shape, size, and texture are consistent with standard yoga mats used for stability and comfort during practice. There are no visible deformations or irregularities, indicating it is flat. This matches common yoga equipment usage and setup. Therefore, the answer is confirmed by visual inspection and general knowledge of yoga accessories.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the feet bare with no footwear?",
    "explanation": "The image clearly shows both of the woman’s feet without any shoes or socks. Her toes and soles are visible, and there is no indication of footwear. In yoga practices, especially poses like Tree Pose, practitioners typically go barefoot to improve grip and balance on the mat. The absence of footwear is consistent with standard yoga etiquette and safety practices. Thus, based on direct visual evidence and world knowledge about yoga, the feet are bare.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the eyes closed and the face relaxed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s eyes are gently closed, and her facial expression appears serene and calm. Her eyebrows are relaxed, and there is no tension around her mouth or jaw. This tranquil expression is typical in yoga poses that emphasize mindfulness and concentration. Closing the eyes helps focus inward, which aligns with the meditative aspect of yoga. Based on visual cues and common yoga practice, the woman’s face reflects relaxation and inner focus.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the body upright and centered on the mat with no leaning?",
    "explanation": "Observing the woman’s posture in Image B, her spine appears straight and vertical, indicating an upright alignment. Her center of gravity is balanced over the standing leg, and her torso remains perpendicular to the ground. She is positioned centrally on the yoga mat, with equal space on either side. There is no visible tilt or lean to one side, suggesting good balance and proper form. This alignment is essential for maintaining stability in Tree Pose. Therefore, based on visual analysis and understanding of yoga posture mechanics, the body is upright and centered.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the arms fully extended upward with elbows straight and palms touching?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s arms are raised vertically above her head, extending from her shoulders to her fingertips. The elbows appear straight, with no visible bending, and her palms are pressed firmly together in a prayer position. This full extension and alignment are characteristic of proper form in yoga, particularly when performing poses with overhead arm positions. The symmetry and precision suggest intentional effort to maintain straightness and contact between palms. Hence, based on visual assessment and knowledge of yoga technique, the arms are fully extended with straight elbows and touching palms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
