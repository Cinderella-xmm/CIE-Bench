      "question": "Are the eyes blue and positioned symmetrically in the face, looking directly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's eyes are clearly visible and appear to be a light blue color, which is consistent with common descriptions of blue irises. The eyes are positioned symmetrically within the facial structure, aligned horizontally and equidistant from the vertical midline of the face. Both eyes are directed straight ahead, indicating that the subject is looking directly forward. This alignment is typical of frontal portraiture, where symmetry and direct gaze are emphasized for balance and engagement. The lighting enhances the visibility of the eye color and symmetry without distortion. Based on visual analysis and common anatomical expectations, the eyes meet both color and positional criteria.",

      "question": "Is the nose small, rounded, and centrally located on the face, aligned with the eyes and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nose in Image B appears proportionate to the rest of the face, exhibiting a small and rounded shape characteristic of youthful facial features. It is centered along the vertical midline of the face, directly between the eyes and above the mouth. The alignment is consistent with standard facial symmetry, where the nose serves as a central anchor point. The bridge and tip of the nose are balanced relative to the surrounding features, and there is no visible deviation or asymmetry. This positioning aligns with typical human facial proportions, especially in children, where features are often more rounded and evenly distributed.",

      "question": "Is the mouth closed, with natural lips forming a gentle, neutral line centered beneath the nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's mouth is visibly closed, with the upper and lower lips meeting in a smooth, continuous line. The lips form a gentle, neutral expression without any indication of smiling or frowning. The mouth is centered beneath the nose, maintaining alignment with the vertical midline of the face. The lip shape is natural, with subtle fullness and no exaggerated contours. This presentation is consistent with a calm, composed facial expression often seen in formal portraits, particularly of children. There is no sign of asymmetry or unnatural tension in the lip area.",

      "question": "Is the shirt white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shirt worn by the subject in Image B is clearly white. The fabric reflects light uniformly, and its color contrasts subtly with the darker background, emphasizing its brightness. While some areas show slight shadows due to lighting, the overall hue remains consistently white, with no visible tinting or discoloration. The material appears to be a soft, possibly cotton-based fabric, which is typical for casual white shirts. The whiteness is uniform across the visible portion of the garment, confirming its color classification.",

      "question": "Is the subject standing upright with arms relaxed at her sides and facing directly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subjectâ€™s posture indicates she is standing upright. Her shoulders are level, and her head is centered over her torso, suggesting proper alignment. Although the arms are not fully visible, the visible portion of the upper arms and shoulders suggests they are relaxed and positioned naturally at her sides. The subject is facing directly forward, as evidenced by the symmetrical placement of facial features and the orientation of the head and body relative to the camera. The lack of tilt or rotation confirms a frontal stance. This posture is typical in formal portrait photography, where the subject is posed to present a balanced and centered appearance.",

      "question": "Is the skin tone consistently fair and unblemished across the face and neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skin tone of the subject in Image B is consistently fair, with a smooth texture and even pigmentation across the face and neck. There are no visible blemishes, acne, scars, or discolorations. The lighting is soft and diffused, which helps highlight the clarity of the skin without creating harsh shadows or exaggerating imperfections. The absence of redness, spots, or uneven tones supports the conclusion that the skin appears healthy and unblemished. This is consistent with idealized representations often seen in artistic or professional portraits, especially when digital enhancement is involved.",

      "question": "Are the facial features symmetrically aligned along the vertical midline of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features exhibit strong symmetry along the vertical midline. The eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth are all aligned such that their left and right counterparts mirror each other closely. The distance from the center of the face to each eye, eyebrow, and cheekbone is nearly identical. The nose is perfectly centered, and the mouth is horizontally aligned with the base of the nose. This symmetry is further supported by the even distribution of light and shadow across both sides of the face. Such precise alignment is often achieved through careful posing and may be enhanced digitally to ensure aesthetic balance. Overall, the facial structure adheres closely to the principles of bilateral symmetry observed in human anatomy.",
