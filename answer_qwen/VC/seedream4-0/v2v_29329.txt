    "Question": "Q1: Is the baby’s head bald with minimal hair?",
    "explanation": "Observing the baby's head in Image B, the scalp is mostly visible with only a very thin layer of fine hair, particularly around the sides and back. This sparse hair coverage is consistent with typical infant hair patterns, where babies often have little to no hair at birth or during early months. The smoothness of the scalp and lack of significant hair volume indicate that the baby is indeed bald with minimal hair. This conclusion aligns with common developmental knowledge about infants’ hair growth stages.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the baby’s eyes large, round, and dark in color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the baby’s eyes are prominently large relative to the face, which is typical for infants due to their high facial proportions. The shape of the eyes is round, and the irises appear dark gray or very dark blue, which can be interpreted as dark in color. While some infants have lighter eye colors initially (which may darken over time), the visual cues here suggest a dark hue. Thus, based on the visual information and general infant physiology, the description 'large, round, and dark' fits accurately.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the baby sitting upright on the couch with legs bent and feet flat?",
    "explanation": "The baby in Image B is seated in an upright position, supported by the backrest of the couch. The legs are bent at the knees, and the feet are positioned flat on the surface of the couch. This posture is stable and typical for a baby who has developed sufficient core strength to sit independently. The angle of the legs and the placement of the feet confirm that they are flat and not dangling or lifted. Therefore, the baby is indeed sitting upright with bent legs and flat feet.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the baby’s hands holding the black-rimmed round glasses in front of the chest?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both of the baby’s hands are clearly visible and grasping a pair of black-rimmed, round-framed glasses. The glasses are held horizontally across the chest area, just below the neck and above the tie. The positioning is symmetrical, with each hand gripping one lens frame. The object is identifiable as glasses due to its shape, size, and structure—consistent with eyewear. This matches the description provided in the question.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the background a mustard-yellow textured couch with visible stitching?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a couch upholstered in a fabric that appears to be mustard-yellow in color. The texture is visible, showing a woven pattern typical of cotton or linen blends used in furniture. Additionally, horizontal stitching lines are clearly present along the backrest and seat cushion, indicating structured upholstery. These visual details align with the description of a mustard-yellow textured couch with visible stitching.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the baby’s feet covered with black socks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the baby’s feet are fully covered by dark-colored socks. The material appears soft and stretchy, consistent with infant sock fabric. The color is uniformly black, matching the description. There is no visible skin or bare foot, confirming that both feet are covered. This observation is straightforward from the image and aligns with common infant clothing practices.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the lighting even and natural, casting soft shadows on the face and clothing?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears soft and diffused, with no harsh highlights or deep shadows. There are subtle gradations of light and shadow on the baby’s face—such as under the chin and around the nose—and gentle shading on the clothing, especially along the folds of the shirt and pants. This suggests the use of natural or studio lighting designed to mimic natural light. The absence of glare or strong directional contrasts indicates even illumination, consistent with professional portrait lighting techniques. Therefore, the lighting is even and natural, producing soft shadows.",
    "answer": "Yes"
