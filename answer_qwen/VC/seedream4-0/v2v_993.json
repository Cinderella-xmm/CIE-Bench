      "question": "Does the chibi character maintain the exact martial arts pose, including the forward leg stance and outward-facing palms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is depicted in a stylized, cartoonish form sitting on the edge of an Instagram interface. While the character's arms are extended outward with palms facing forward, mimicking the original pose, the leg position is significantly different. The chibi character is seated with legs spread apart but not in a forward lunge or martial arts stance as seen in the original. Instead, the posture is more relaxed and playful, inconsistent with the dynamic martial arts pose. This deviation is due to the transformation into a chibi style, which prioritizes cuteness and simplification over anatomical accuracy. Therefore, the pose is not maintained exactly.",

      "question": "Is the chibi character wearing a black outfit identical to the original, including the loose-fitting shirt and pants?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character in Image B is wearing a black top and black pants, which visually match the color and general silhouette of the original outfit in Image A. However, the fit and style differ due to the chibi art style. The clothing appears more simplified and proportionally adjusted to fit the exaggerated proportions of the character (e.g., larger head, smaller body). The loose-fitting nature of the original shirt and pants is preserved in concept, but the details such as fabric draping and fit are abstracted. Thus, while the color and basic design are consistent, the exactness of the fit and style is altered for stylistic reasons.",

      "question": "Does the chibi character have a neat bun hairstyle similar to the original subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character has black hair styled into a small, rounded bun on top of the head. This matches the general idea of the original subject’s neat bun hairstyle in Image A. However, the chibi version is highly stylized—simplified and exaggerated in shape, lacking the fine detail and natural texture of the real hair. Despite these differences, the core feature (a bun) is preserved, indicating that the hairstyle is conceptually similar even if not identical in execution. The transformation aligns with common chibi art conventions where hair is simplified but key features are retained.",

      "question": "Does the black outfit on the chibi character fit in a way that logically matches the martial arts pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character in Image B is not in a martial arts pose; instead, it is seated on the Instagram interface in a relaxed, playful manner. Because the pose is not martial arts-based, the outfit does not need to accommodate the tension and movement associated with such a stance. The clothing fits the character’s proportions appropriately for its seated position, but since the pose itself is not martial arts-oriented, the fit cannot be said to 'logically match' the original martial arts stance. The outfit is designed for the chibi aesthetic rather than functional realism. Hence, the fit is logical for the current pose but not for the original martial arts context.",

      "question": "Does the chibi character's black outfit retain the simplicity and lack of additional patterns or designs seen in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original outfit in Image A is plain black with no visible patterns, logos, or embellishments, emphasizing minimalism. In Image B, the chibi character’s outfit is also entirely black and lacks any visible patterns, designs, or branding. This simplicity is preserved, consistent with the original’s aesthetic. The chibi style often uses solid colors and minimal detail, which aligns with the original’s clean look. Therefore, despite the stylistic differences, the absence of additional patterns or designs is maintained.",
