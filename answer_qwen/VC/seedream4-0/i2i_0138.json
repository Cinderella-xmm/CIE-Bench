        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silver blades of the scissors exhibit clear reflections, particularly noticeable along their edges and surfaces. The lighting highlights the metallic sheen, indicating a high degree of reflectivity. This is consistent with polished stainless steel or similar materials typically used in high-quality scissors. The reflections are sharp and distinct, suggesting that the surface has not been dulled or obscured by any editing process. Based on visual cues such as light interaction and surface texture, the blades remain visibly reflective.",

      "question": "Do the golden handles still show a polished finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden handles in Image B display a smooth, shiny surface with visible highlights and subtle gradients caused by the lighting. These characteristics are indicative of a polished metal finish, commonly seen in premium scissors. There are no signs of scratches, tarnish, or matte textures that would suggest a loss of polish. The reflection of light across the curved surfaces further confirms the presence of a polished, reflective finish. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and common knowledge about polished metal objects, the handles retain their polished appearance.",

      "question": "Is the open V-shape configuration of the blades preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blades in Image B maintain an open V-shape, with the tips pointing outward and the pivot point at the center. This configuration is typical for scissors when they are partially open. The angle between the blades is consistent with the original form, and there is no distortion or warping visible in the structure. The alignment of the blades relative to each other remains symmetrical and functional, which is essential for proper scissor operation. Thus, the V-shape configuration is preserved.",

      "question": "Is the background still a uniform dark gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears to be a consistent dark gray color throughout, with minimal variation in tone. While there are slight gradients due to lighting (such as a subtle shadow beneath the scissors), the overall color remains uniform and flat, without any visible patterns, textures, or discoloration. This suggests that the background has not been altered significantly from its original state. The uniformity supports the idea that it was intentionally kept simple to emphasize the scissors. Therefore, the background remains a uniform dark gray.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of the blades in Image B appear clean and well-defined, with no visible signs of chipping, rust, or dulling. The lighting accentuates the fine lines along the cutting edges, which are crisp and uninterrupted. Additionally, the text 'Sharp' placed near the blade tip reinforces the intended message of precision and cleanliness. In real-world terms, sharp scissors have clean, unblemished edges, and this image visually communicates that quality. Even though the image is stylized, the visual cues align with expectations of sharpness. Hence, the edges are depicted as clean and sharp.",
