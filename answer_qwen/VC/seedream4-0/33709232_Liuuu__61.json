      "question": "Is the white rectangular signboard with the black kanji \"どぜう\" present above the entrance of the traditional building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a white rectangular signboard with the black Japanese kanji 'どぜう' is clearly visible above the entrance of the traditional-style building. This sign remains consistent with its position in the original image, despite the addition of a large robot structure on top of the building. The sign's placement and text are unchanged, indicating that it is still present. The visual cues—such as the font style, color contrast, and spatial positioning—confirm its presence. Even though the robot dominates the upper portion of the frame, the sign is not obscured and remains legible. This conclusion is based on direct observation and the fact that such signage in traditional Japanese buildings often serves as a nameplate or establishment identifier.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical white sign with black Japanese text 'うちおぎ 仮四宿' is visible on the left side of the traditional building. Its placement and orientation remain consistent with the original scene. Although the surrounding environment has been altered with futuristic elements like robots, this particular sign has not been removed or obscured. The text is legible and matches the typical format of supplementary signage found on traditional Japanese establishments, often indicating business type or affiliation. Based on visual confirmation and knowledge of architectural signage conventions in Japan, this sign is indeed present.",

      "question": "Is the tall wooden utility pole with multiple wires and attached streetlights visible on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall wooden utility pole with numerous electrical wires and attached streetlights is clearly visible on the left side of the frame. Despite the fantastical additions (such as the giant robot), the pole remains intact and unaltered in its structural form. Utility poles in urban Japanese settings commonly feature this configuration—dense wiring, multiple fixtures, and a weathered appearance. The presence of this pole contributes to the realism of the scene, even within a surreal context. Therefore, based on visual evidence and common urban infrastructure patterns in Japan, the pole is present.",

      "question": "Are white zebra crossing stripes visible on the road surface in front of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white zebra crossing stripes are visible on the road surface directly in front of the traditional building. These markings are clearly defined and extend across the width of the street, consistent with standard pedestrian crosswalks in urban Japanese environments. Even with the addition of robotic figures walking across the street, the crosswalk lines remain unobscured and identifiable. The presence of such markings supports traffic safety norms in densely populated areas. Thus, based on both visual clarity and real-world urban design principles, the zebra crossing is present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bicycle is visible on the sidewalk near the right edge of the image. It is partially obscured by the robotic figure in the foreground but can still be identified by its distinct frame, wheels, and handlebars. The bicycle appears to be leaning against a pole or railing, which is typical for parked bikes in urban Japanese streets. This detail aligns with common cityscape elements where bicycles are frequently used for short-distance travel. Therefore, based on visual recognition and contextual knowledge of urban transportation habits in Japan, the bicycle is present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central ground-floor section of the traditional building features a dark doorway with hanging curtains. These curtains are light-colored and appear to be made of fabric, consistent with traditional Japanese sliding doors or noren used to indicate entryways. The doorway is positioned symmetrically and framed by wooden elements, reinforcing its role as the main entrance. This architectural feature is preserved despite the futuristic modifications above the building. Based on visual analysis and cultural knowledge of traditional Japanese architecture, the doorway with curtains is present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper level of the traditional building’s façade includes horizontal wooden lattices covering the windows. These lattices are characteristic of traditional Japanese architecture, providing ventilation while maintaining privacy. They are evenly spaced and aligned with the building’s structure. Despite the overlay of robotic elements and neon lighting, these lattices remain visible and unaltered. Their presence contributes to the authenticity of the building’s design. Therefore, based on visual inspection and architectural knowledge, the horizontal wooden lattices are present.",

      "question": "Is the traditional building positioned in front of the tall white skyscraper, creating a layered depth effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the traditional building is situated in the foreground, with the tall white skyscraper visible behind it, forming a clear layered depth effect. The skyscraper rises vertically in the background, towering over the lower, more horizontally oriented traditional structure. This juxtaposition emphasizes the contrast between old and new architectural styles, a common theme in urban Japanese landscapes. The alignment of the buildings and the perspective suggest intentional layering for visual impact. While the robot adds a surreal element, the relative positions of the buildings remain unchanged from the original image. Thus, based on spatial composition and urban design principles, the traditional building is indeed positioned in front of the skyscraper.",
