      "question": "Are the battery tops rendered in copper color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top portion of the batteries is depicted with a metallic orange-brown hue that closely resembles copper. This visual choice aligns with the traditional copper-colored top of Duracell Coppertop batteries, which is a well-known design feature. The rendering uses shading and highlights to simulate a reflective, metallic surface, consistent with copper. Given that the original product (Image A) features copper-colored tops, and this image maintains that aesthetic in a stylized form, it is reasonable to conclude that the battery tops are indeed rendered in copper color.",

      "question": "Is the word \"DURACELL\" printed vertically in white on the black body of each battery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each battery-like object has a black cylindrical body with the word 'DURACELL' written vertically in white text. This matches the standard branding seen on actual Duracell batteries, where the brand name appears in bold white letters on a black background. Even though the batteries are stylized as part of a futuristic theme, the text remains clearly visible and consistent with real-world product labeling. Therefore, the vertical white 'DURACELL' text is present.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a silver band near the base of each battery with the word \"DURALOCK\" inscribed on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, each battery displays a silver or gray metallic band just below the copper-colored top. On this band, the word 'DURALOCK' is clearly inscribed in capital letters. This detail mirrors the actual packaging and design of Duracell Coppertop batteries, where the Duralock Power Preserve technology is highlighted with such a band. The presence of this band and its labeling is consistent across all four batteries in the image, confirming its inclusion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a digital display screen integrated into the front of the battery pack at the bottom center. On this screen, the text '10 Years in Storage' is prominently displayed in glowing blue font. This directly references the 10-year storage guarantee advertised by Duracell. Although the presentation is stylized and futuristic, the phrase is clearly legible and matches the claim made in the original packaging (Image A). Thus, the phrase is indeed visible.",

      "question": "Are there exactly four batteries or battery-inspired characters depicted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows four robotic figures standing in a row. Each robot is designed to resemble a Duracell battery, with a copper-colored top and a black body labeled 'DURACELL'. These figures are clearly inspired by the physical appearance of AA batteries. There are no additional battery-like characters beyond these four. While they are not literal batteries but stylized representations, they are explicitly modeled after the four-pack format of the original product. Therefore, there are exactly four battery-inspired characters.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, the word 'DURACELL' is prominently featured in large, bold, white capital letters against a black rectangular background. It is positioned centrally and dominates the upper portion of the image, serving as the main brand identifier. This placement and style are consistent with how brands emphasize their logo in promotional materials. The text is highly visible and clearly intended to be the focal point of the branding, matching the expectations from both real-world product design and marketing conventions.",
