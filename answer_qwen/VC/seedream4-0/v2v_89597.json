      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central touchscreen is visually present and appears to occupy a central position within the dashboard area, similar to its placement in typical modern vehicle interiors. Despite the artistic transformation into a watercolor-style rendering, the screen's shape and relative location remain consistent with a central console layout. The symmetry of the surrounding dashboard elements—such as the steering wheel on the left and the dashboard trim on the right—supports the inference that the screen is still centered. Although the image is stylized, the spatial relationships between components suggest that the touchscreen maintains its original central positioning. This conclusion is drawn by comparing the proportions and alignment of the screen relative to other fixed interior features.",

      "question": "Does the dashboard retain its general structure and placement relative to the steering wheel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the abstract, ink-wash art style, the overall form of the dashboard and its relationship to the steering wheel can still be inferred. The steering wheel is visible on the left side, and the dashboard extends horizontally across the image, with the central touchscreen situated between them. The spatial hierarchy—the steering wheel on the left, the instrument cluster behind it, and the central console in the middle—mirrors the typical layout of a modern car interior. Even though details are obscured by brushstrokes, the structural continuity is preserved through the alignment and proportion of these key components. Therefore, the general structure and relative placement remain consistent with standard automotive design.",

      "question": "Is the steering wheel still partially visible on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left side of the image shows a dark, curved shape resembling the contour of a steering wheel, particularly in the lower-left quadrant. Though rendered in abstract black ink strokes, the form retains enough curvature and positioning to match the expected appearance of a steering wheel in a vehicle interior. Its location relative to the dashboard and central screen aligns with real-world vehicle layouts, where the steering wheel is typically on the driver’s side. The visual cues—such as the circular outline and proximity to the instrument panel—support the conclusion that the steering wheel is still partially visible, even if stylized.",

      "question": "Does the overall spatial arrangement of the vehicle's interior remain consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B is heavily stylized with calligraphic and ink-wash effects, the underlying spatial logic of the vehicle interior remains intact. The positions of the steering wheel, dashboard, central touchscreen, and instrument cluster are all aligned in a way that mirrors the original layout seen in Image A. The relative distances and orientations of these components—such as the steering wheel on the left, the screen centered, and the dashboard extending across the top—are preserved. While details are abstracted, the compositional structure reflects the same spatial arrangement, indicating consistency in layout despite the artistic transformation. This judgment relies on recognizing familiar automotive ergonomics and spatial relationships, which are maintained even in non-photorealistic representations.",

      "question": "Are the airflow graphics on the screen still discernible, even if represented through calligraphic strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central touchscreen displays abstract brushwork that loosely resembles flowing lines or waves, particularly in the lower-center region of the screen. These strokes, while not literal representations of airflow, evoke movement and directionality, which are characteristic of airflow visualization in vehicle climate controls. Additionally, the presence of calligraphic characters and the overall aesthetic suggest an intentional artistic interpretation of functional UI elements. Given that airflow graphics in such systems often use directional arrows or animated flows, the stylized brushstrokes can be interpreted as a creative rendition of those same concepts. Thus, while not photorealistic, the airflow graphics are still conceptually discernible through their artistic representation.",
