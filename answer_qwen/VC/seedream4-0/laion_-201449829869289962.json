      "question": "Is the onion-shaped dome on top of the bell tower retained in the same form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dome atop the bell tower appears to have a similar onion-like shape as seen in traditional Alpine church architecture. However, its color has changed from dark green (as seen in typical aged copper domes) to a bright copper or bronze hue, suggesting a stylized or artistic rendering rather than a faithful reproduction. The overall silhouette and curvature are preserved, but the material appearance differs. Based on visual cues, the form is retained, though not in original material appearance. This conclusion combines architectural knowledge of onion domes common in Alpine regions with observation of color and shape.",

      "question": "Is the clock face featuring Roman numerals and blue hands visible and correctly positioned on the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is clearly visible on the front of the bell tower, positioned at approximately mid-height. It displays Roman numerals and features blue hands, consistent with the original design seen in many European churches. The placement matches typical architectural conventions where clocks are centered on the tower facade for visibility. This aligns with world knowledge about church clock placements and design elements. The clarity and positioning suggest it was intentionally preserved in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The front facade of the church in Image B includes a distinct black quatrefoil-shaped window, which is a decorative architectural feature commonly found in traditional European church designs. This element is clearly visible and centrally located above the main entrance. The presence of such a window is consistent with historical church architecture, particularly in Alpine regions. Its inclusion in the edited image suggests an effort to preserve key stylistic details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bell tower is visibly connected to the main body of the church and is located on the left side when viewing the structure from the front. This spatial arrangement is consistent with many European church layouts where the tower is integrated into the buildingâ€™s design. The connection between the tower and church is clear, and the relative positioning remains accurate compared to typical architectural plans. This conclusion is based on visual alignment and architectural norms.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hillsides surrounding the church display distinct terraced patterns, especially on the left side of the image. These stepped formations are characteristic of vineyard cultivation in mountainous regions such as those in Austria or Switzerland. The terraces are neatly arranged and follow the contours of the land, indicating agricultural use. This visual detail aligns with real-world examples of alpine viticulture, confirming their presence in the scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the apex of the dome in Image B, a small cross is visible, positioned directly above the golden finial. This is a standard feature in Christian church architecture, symbolizing faith and religious significance. The cross is clearly distinguishable against the sky and maintains its symbolic placement. This detail reflects both visual observation and general knowledge of ecclesiastical design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower section of the bell tower in Image B shows a textured surface composed of light gray rectangular blocks, consistent with masonry construction using stone. This matches the typical materials used in historic church towers in mountainous regions. The uniformity and pattern of the blocks support the interpretation that they represent stone masonry. This assessment is based on visual texture analysis and architectural knowledge of building materials.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The roof of the main church in Image B is clearly covered with reddish-brown tiles that resemble terracotta. This roofing material is common in traditional European church architecture, especially in Alpine areas, due to its durability and aesthetic appeal. The color and texture are consistent with terracotta tiles, and the overlapping pattern further supports this identification. This conclusion combines visual evidence with regional architectural knowledge.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several small buildings with sloped roofs are visible around the church, particularly on the right side and along the hillside. These structures resemble traditional alpine homes, characterized by steep roofs designed to shed snow. Their presence adds to the rural village atmosphere depicted in the scene. This observation is supported by architectural patterns typical of mountain settlements.",
