      "question": "Is the central rose engraving present on the front of the teapot's body, with clearly defined layered petals and shaded depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the teapot prominently features a large rose at its center. The engraving is highly detailed, with multiple layers of petals that are clearly delineated through shading and contouring, giving it a three-dimensional appearance. The use of light and shadow enhances the depth perception, making each petal distinct and contributing to a realistic floral relief. This level of detail is consistent with fine metalwork craftsmanship, where such engravings are common in ornamental teapots. Based on visual cues and knowledge of decorative metal artistry, the central rose is indeed present and meticulously rendered.",

      "question": "Does the spout extend from the left side of the teapot in a smooth, curved arc, maintaining its original shape and attachment point?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spout of the teapot is visible on the left side, extending outward in a graceful, curved arc. It maintains a consistent thickness and smooth curvature from its base to the tip, which is typical of traditional teapot design. The attachment point appears to be seamlessly integrated into the body of the teapot, matching the overall aesthetic and structural continuity. There is no distortion or deviation from what would be expected in a well-crafted metallic teapot. This matches standard design principles for functional yet decorative teapots, where the spout must both serve a practical purpose and complement the form. Therefore, the spout retains its original shape and attachment point.",

      "question": "Is the handle on the right side of the teapot formed into an ornate, scrolled design with visible curls and decorative flourishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle on the right side of the teapot in Image B is clearly ornate, featuring intricate scrollwork with multiple curls and decorative elements. These flourishes are characteristic of baroque or rococo-inspired metalwork, often seen in antique silverware and ceremonial teapots. The curves are symmetrical and well-defined, with visible detailing that suggests handcrafting or high-quality casting. This design is not only functional but also serves as a visual accent, enhancing the teapot’s elegance. Given the style and precision of the handle, it aligns with known examples of decorative metal handles in historical artifacts.",

      "question": "Is there a decorative finial on top of the lid, shaped like a stylized acorn or flame motif?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On top of the lid in Image B, there is a small, ornamental finial. Its shape is pointed and tapers upward, resembling a stylized flame or possibly a pinecone or acorn-like form. This type of finial is common in decorative metalware, especially in European or Victorian-era designs, where such motifs symbolize elegance and craftsmanship. The finial is intricately detailed, with ridges and patterns that suggest a deliberate artistic choice rather than a simple knob. While it may not be an exact replica of a natural acorn, its silhouette and structure closely resemble a stylized version of one. Therefore, based on visual analysis and familiarity with decorative motifs, the finial can be described as resembling a stylized acorn or flame.",

      "question": "Does the teapot have a thin, ridged band at its base with repeating geometric detailing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the base of the teapot in Image B, there is a distinct circular band that separates the main body from the foot. This band features fine, repeating geometric patterns, likely etched or embossed into the metal. These patterns appear uniform and precise, consistent with decorative metalwork techniques used in artisanal pieces. The ridging is subtle but visible, adding texture and visual interest to the lower portion of the teapot. Such detailing is typical in high-end silver or pewter teapots, where the base is often embellished to match the rest of the ornamentation. Thus, the presence of this thin, ridged band with geometric detail is confirmed by visual inspection.",

      "question": "Are there detailed leaf and floral patterns surrounding the central rose on the body of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Surrounding the central rose on the teapot in Image B, there are numerous engraved leaves and additional floral elements, including smaller blossoms and vines. These patterns are intricately carved, with attention to vein details on the leaves and petal shapes on the flowers. The arrangement forms a cohesive botanical motif that complements the central rose. This kind of detailed surrounding decoration is typical in ornamental metalwork, where symmetry and naturalistic themes are emphasized. The depth and shading suggest careful craftsmanship, reinforcing the presence of these supporting floral and foliate designs.",

      "question": "Does the teapot exhibit a polished, reflective metallic surface with visible highlights and shadows indicating a shiny material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the teapot in Image B shows clear reflections of light, particularly on the curved areas of the body, spout, and handle. These highlights are sharp and well-defined, suggesting a highly polished, reflective material such as silver or chrome-plated metal. Shadows cast across the surface follow the contours of the object, emphasizing its three-dimensionality and smooth finish. The way light interacts with the surface—creating bright spots and soft gradients—indicates a shiny, metallic texture. This is consistent with real-world behavior of polished metals under directional lighting, confirming that the teapot has a reflective, polished appearance.",
