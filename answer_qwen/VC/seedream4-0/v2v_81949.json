      "question": "Is the chimney sweep still holding the brush over his shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chimney sweep is clearly depicted with a long brush resting diagonally across his body, extending from his right shoulder down toward his left hand. The brush's bristles are visible at the top left of the circular frame, and the handle passes over his shoulder, consistent with the typical posture of a chimney sweep carrying tools. This visual cue, combined with common knowledge of how chimney sweeps traditionally carry their brushes, supports the conclusion that he is indeed holding the brush over his shoulder. This matches the original depiction in Image A, where the same pose is maintained.",

      "question": "Does the chimney sweep still have the coiled hose slung across his back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible coiled hose draped over the chimney sweep’s back, running from his right shoulder down to his waist. The hose appears thick and segmented, consistent with the type used in chimney cleaning operations. This detail is preserved from Image A, where the same coiled hose is present, though simplified in design. The presence of this equipment is logical given the profession—chimney sweeps often use hoses for suction or water-based cleaning. The continuity of this element between both images confirms its retention in Image B.",

      "question": "Is there still a brick chimney positioned to the left of the chimney sweep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a red brick chimney is prominently featured directly beneath the chimney sweep, slightly to his left. It is detailed with individual bricks and mortar lines, showing signs of wear and soot, which adds realism to the urban setting. While in Image A, the chimney was more stylized and abstract, in Image B it is rendered with greater depth and texture, but its position relative to the figure remains consistent—on the left side of the sweep. This placement aligns with the typical scene of a chimney sweep working on a rooftop, reinforcing the authenticity of the image.",

      "question": "Is the yellow circle still present as a background element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the circular framing structure, and within it, a bright yellow background dominates the central area behind the chimney sweep. Although the yellow is now accented with radiating lines and halftone dots, giving it a comic-book or propaganda-poster aesthetic, the core circular yellow backdrop is still present. In contrast, Image A had a simpler, solid yellow circle without additional textures. Despite these stylistic enhancements, the yellow circle remains a key compositional element in Image B, serving as a visual anchor around the central figure.",

      "question": "Is the chimney sweep still wearing a cap, jacket, and gloves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chimney sweep is clearly wearing a white cap, consistent with traditional workwear for such laborers. He is also dressed in a dark jacket over a shirt and tie, indicating formal work attire typical of early 20th-century tradesmen. However, upon close inspection, no gloves are visible on his hands—his fingers are bare, and the skin tone is exposed. In Image A, the hands were similarly depicted without gloves, suggesting this detail was not included in either version. Therefore, while the cap and jacket are present, the gloves are absent in both images. Based on the question asking about all three items, and since gloves are missing, the correct answer is 'No'.",
