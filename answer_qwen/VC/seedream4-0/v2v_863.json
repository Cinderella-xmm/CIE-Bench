      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is depicted as a small, stylized figurine placed on a kitchen counter next to a cereal box. Visually, it has large ears, which are characteristic of elephants, especially African elephants. It also has prominent tusks and a visible trunk, both of which are key anatomical features of elephants. Although the style is cartoonish and simplified, these core features are present. The design choices reflect common representations of elephants in children’s media or toys, where exaggerated but recognizable traits are preserved for identification. Therefore, despite the stylization, the essential features—large ears, tusks, and trunk—are retained.",

      "question": "** Does the edited image show the elephant in a posture that suggests it is carrying something heavy?\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is a small figurine standing upright on a countertop with no visible load or burden. Its posture is relaxed and playful, with one hand near its mouth as if thinking or tasting. There is no indication of strain, bent posture, or weight-bearing stance that would suggest it is carrying something heavy. In contrast, in Image A, the elephant is shown supporting a massive globe on its back, clearly indicating a posture of bearing immense weight. This comparison highlights a complete shift in context and physical implication between the two images. The edited version removes any suggestion of burden or strength-related action.",

      "question": "** Does the edited image retain earthy tones and a textured appearance for the elephant's skin?\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant figurine is rendered in smooth, uniform gray with minimal texturing. The skin lacks the rough, wrinkled texture typical of real elephants, and instead appears glossy and plastic-like, consistent with toy materials. While the color palette includes shades of gray and beige—colors that could be considered earthy—the overall visual effect is not naturalistic. In contrast, Image A shows an elephant with highly detailed, wrinkled skin and a realistic, earth-toned coloration that reflects actual elephant anatomy and texture. Thus, while some earthy hues are present in Image B, the textured appearance is absent due to the stylized, non-realistic rendering.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a bright, cheerful outdoor kitchen scene with vibrant greenery, a clear blue sky, and natural light filtering through leaves. The presence of fresh fruits, a well-designed cereal box, and a cute elephant figurine contributes to a warm, inviting, and peaceful ambiance. The composition is balanced, with soft lighting and a sense of domestic tranquility. This setting evokes feelings of comfort and harmony, commonly associated with wholesome, nature-inspired environments. Compared to Image A, which has a more dramatic and symbolic tone with a giant Earth resting on an elephant, Image B shifts to a lighter, more whimsical mood. However, within its own context, the atmosphere remains serene and harmonious.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The cereal box in Image B displays a bowl filled with oats, almonds, cashews, and other nuts, clearly indicating the inclusion of whole grains and nuts. The imagery on the box also includes pineapples, oranges, and lemons, representing tropical fruits. Additionally, the label mentions 'natural sweeteners' and 'organic,' suggesting the use of natural ingredients. The overall design uses rich colors and realistic depictions of food items to convey healthiness and naturalness. These visual cues align with the product claims and are consistent with marketing practices for organic, nutritious cereals. Therefore, the design effectively communicates the intended ingredients and qualities of the product.",
