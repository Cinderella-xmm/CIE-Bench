      "question": "Is the seahorse’s body shaped with a curved neck leading to a downward-curving tail, forming a recognizable seahorse silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse figure has a distinct anatomical structure typical of a seahorse. The head is positioned at the top, followed by a curved neck that transitions into a body that bends downward in a characteristic S-shape, culminating in a curled tail. This curvature is consistent with the natural silhouette of a seahorse, which is known for its upright posture and coiled tail. The overall shape aligns with common depictions of seahorses in both realistic and stylized forms, especially in decorative or toy representations. Therefore, based on visual cues and biological knowledge of seahorse anatomy, the silhouette is indeed recognizable.",

      "question": "Is there a music note symbol located within a heart shape on the central yellow belly section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central yellow belly section of the seahorse in Image B features a prominent pink heart shape. Inside this heart, there is a clear depiction of a musical note symbol (specifically a quarter note). This design element is consistent across both images, but in Image B, the transparency of the material allows for better visibility of the internal details. The presence of the musical note inside the heart is unambiguous and matches the description exactly. This is likely a thematic design choice, suggesting a musical function or aesthetic appeal related to sound or rhythm.",

      "question": "Is there a ribbon-like bow positioned at the top of the seahorse’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the seahorse’s head in Image B, there is a decorative element resembling a bow. It is made of translucent, layered material with a purple hue, styled in a ruffled fashion similar to a ribbon or fin. While it may not be a traditional fabric bow like in Image A, its placement and form strongly suggest it functions as a decorative bow atop the head. In stylized representations, such elements are often used to enhance charm or character, especially in toys or collectibles. Thus, despite being made of plastic rather than fabric, it visually serves the same purpose as a ribbon-like bow.",

      "question": "Are there exactly two fins positioned on the sides of the seahorse’s body, near the midsection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse has two side fins visible—one on each side—located near the midsection of the body. These fins are transparent with a purple tint and have a fan-like structure, consistent with the dorsal or pectoral fins seen in seahorse anatomy. They are symmetrically placed and clearly distinguishable from other body parts. There are no additional fins elsewhere on the body, confirming that only two are present in this region. This matches typical artistic representations of seahorses, where paired fins are shown for balance and movement in water.",

      "question": "Are the eyes large, round, black with white highlights, and placed symmetrically on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes of the seahorse in Image B are indeed large and round, positioned symmetrically on either side of the face. Each eye consists of a black circular pupil with a small white highlight, giving them a glossy, lifelike appearance. This design is common in stylized animal figures to convey cuteness and expressiveness. The symmetry and positioning are consistent with both real seahorse anatomy and cartoonish interpretations. Even though the material is transparent, the eye details remain clearly defined and match the described characteristics.",

      "question": "Is the yellow belly section located centrally on the body and larger than the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The yellow belly section in Image B is positioned centrally along the length of the seahorse's body, directly beneath the head and above the tail. Its size is notably larger than the head, both in width and volume. The bulbous, oval shape of the yellow section contrasts with the more compact head, making it a dominant feature of the figure. This proportion is typical in stylized or toy versions of animals, where certain features are exaggerated for visual appeal. Given the visual evidence and standard design principles in children’s toys, the belly is clearly larger than the head.",
