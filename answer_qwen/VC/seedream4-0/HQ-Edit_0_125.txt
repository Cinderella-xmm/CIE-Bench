    "Question": "Q1: Is the woman’s face clearly visible with the same eye shape, nose, mouth, and short wavy black hair as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s face is clearly visible. Her facial features—eyes, nose, and mouth—are consistent with a stylized, cartoon-like representation that retains the general proportions and expressions seen in the original image. The eyes are almond-shaped, the nose is slender, and the mouth has a gentle smile, all of which align with typical East Asian aesthetic portrayals in illustrated art. Her hair is black, shoulder-length, and wavy, matching the description in the original. However, due to the artistic style shift from photorealistic to illustrative, the details are simplified but still recognizable as consistent with the original. Therefore, despite stylistic differences, the core features remain visually aligned.",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the robe maintain the red-on-right and navy-blue-on-left color division across the torso and sleeves?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robe's design preserves the distinct color division observed in the original image. The right side of the torso and sleeve are rendered in red, while the left side is navy blue, following the traditional asymmetrical design of certain East Asian garments such as hanboks or modified qipaos. This split is maintained consistently across both the upper body and sleeves, with clear demarcation along the central seam. The illustration style simplifies textures but does not alter the fundamental color layout. Comparing this to Image A, the same color scheme is preserved, confirming consistency in design intent despite the change in medium.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the rose and vine floral patterns visible along the robe’s seams, front panel, and sleeves as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floral motifs—specifically roses and vines—are clearly depicted along the central seam, front panel, and sleeves of the robe. These patterns are rendered in gold and red tones, consistent with traditional decorative elements found in ceremonial attire. While the illustration style uses clean lines and flat colors, the placement and design of the floral embroidery match those in the original image. In Image A, these patterns were more detailed and textured, but in Image B, they are stylized yet still present in the same locations. Thus, the key visual elements of the pattern remain intact.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a high slit on the right leg of the robe, revealing part of the leg?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a high slit is visible on the right side of the robe, extending upward from the hemline, exposing part of the woman’s leg. This design feature is common in traditional and modern interpretations of flowing robes to allow mobility. The slit is positioned along the right leg, consistent with the original image’s design. Although the illustration is less detailed than the photorealistic version, the silhouette clearly indicates the presence of the slit. Comparing to Image A, the slit is similarly placed and proportioned, confirming its retention in the edited version.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are red paper lanterns visible hanging in rows above the market alley, glowing warmly?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, red paper lanterns are indeed visible, suspended in rows above the scene. They emit a soft, warm glow, contributing to the festive atmosphere typical of East Asian markets during celebrations like Lunar New Year. The lanterns are stylized but retain their iconic shape and color. Although the background is lighter and more abstract compared to Image A, the lanterns are still clearly identifiable. In Image A, the lanterns were more numerous and sharply defined, but here they are simplified yet still present and glowing, maintaining the thematic element.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are there visible stalls with tomatoes, oranges, and green vegetables arranged in crates along both sides of the alley?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, stalls are faintly visible on both sides of the alley, containing produce such as tomatoes (red), oranges (yellow), and green vegetables. These items are arranged in crate-like containers, consistent with a market setting. However, due to the illustrative and faded background style, the details are less sharp than in Image A. Still, the presence of these specific fruits and vegetables can be inferred from their colors and shapes. In Image A, these stalls were highly detailed and vivid, but in Image B, they are artistically subdued yet still recognizable. Therefore, the essential elements are preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Is the ground paved with stone tiles and the roof supported by wooden beams?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ground appears to be paved, though the texture is simplified and lacks the detailed stone tile pattern seen in Image A. The roofing structure is implied but not clearly defined; wooden beams are not distinctly visible due to the stylized and semi-transparent background treatment. In contrast, Image A clearly shows stone-paved ground and wooden beams supporting the roof, characteristic of traditional market architecture. In Image B, these architectural details are minimized for aesthetic effect, making them indistinct. Therefore, while the concept of a paved street and covered market is suggested, the specific materials and structural elements are not clearly visible.",
    "answer": "No"
