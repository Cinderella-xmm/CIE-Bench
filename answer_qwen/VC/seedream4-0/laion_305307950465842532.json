      "question": "Is the wide-brimmed cowboy hat still present on the head of the individual on the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual on the left is clearly wearing a wide-brimmed cowboy hat, which is light beige in color with a thin blue band around the crown. This style of hat is consistent with traditional country or western fashion and matches the overall aesthetic of the image, which includes desert-themed elements like cacti and a sunset in the background. The hat is positioned properly on his head, covering part of his forehead and ears. Based on visual evidence, the hat is present and worn as intended. There is no indication of it being removed or altered.",

      "question": "Does the individual on the left have long wavy blonde hair and a full beard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The individual on the left has shoulder-length, wavy hair that appears to be a golden blonde color. His facial hair consists of a full beard and mustache, neatly groomed but substantial enough to be considered 'full.' This appearance aligns with common public images of this individual (Brian Kelley of Florida Georgia Line). The hair is visible beneath the brim of the hat, and the beard is clearly defined around his jawline and chin. Therefore, both the hair length and facial hair description match the visual evidence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The individual on the right has short, neatly styled hair that is light brown or reddish-brown in tone. His beard is well-groomed and appears to be trimmed closely, forming a clean line along his jawline and upper lip. This style is consistent with modern men's grooming trends and matches known public appearances of Tyler Hubbard, the other member of Florida Georgia Line. The hair is not long or shaggy, and the beard is not full or untrimmed, confirming the description.",

      "question": "Are the two individuals standing side-by-side, with the left individual slightly forward and both facing the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visually, both individuals are positioned side-by-side, with the person on the left (Brian Kelley) appearing slightly more forward than the one on the right (Tyler Hubbard). Their bodies are oriented directly toward the camera, and their faces are centered and aligned with the viewerâ€™s perspective. The composition suggests a balanced yet dynamic pose, where the left individual is subtly emphasized by positioning. This is typical in promotional photos for musical acts, where slight depth cues are used to create visual interest without disrupting symmetry.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, neither individual is making a gesture with their hands. Both arms appear to be at their sides or resting naturally. There is no visible hand movement or palm-up gesture. In contrast, in Image A, both individuals are seen with open palms facing upward, indicating a difference between the two images. However, in Image B, the hands are not raised or gesturing, so the answer is based solely on the visual content of Image B.",

      "question": "Is the text \"FLORIDA GEORGIA LINE: RISE TO THE TOP\" present in the lower third of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower third of Image B contains a banner with the text 'FLORIDA GEORGIA LINE' in bold white letters against a dark blue background. However, the phrase 'RISE TO THE TOP' is not present. Instead, the text is simply 'FLORIDA GEORGIA LINE,' which differs from the original caption in Image A. The design of the banner also includes decorative elements such as boots and a vintage-style border, which further distinguishes it from Image A. Thus, while the band name is present, the specific subtitle is not.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both individuals are standing upright with their torsos perpendicular to the ground, and their heads are turned directly toward the camera. Their gazes are fixed forward, and there is no noticeable tilt or angle in their posture. This direct orientation is typical for promotional photography, especially when aiming to convey confidence and approachability. The alignment of their shoulders and facial features supports the conclusion that they are facing straight ahead.",
