    "Question": "Q1: Is the Nikon branding visible and legible in the illustration?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Nikon branding is clearly visible on the top of the camera body. The text 'Nikon' is rendered in a white font against the dark, metallic surface of the camera, which contrasts well enough to ensure legibility. Despite the steampunk aesthetic that includes rusted metal textures and mechanical components, the brand name remains intact and readable. This conclusion is drawn from direct visual inspection of the text's clarity and placement, consistent with how real-world product branding is preserved even in stylized representations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the lens positioned centrally on the camera body in the steampunk illustration?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lens appears to be centered on the front of the camera body, just as it would be in a standard DSLR configuration. The symmetry of the design, including the alignment of the lens barrel with the central axis of the camera, supports this observation. Even though the lens has been modified with steampunk elements such as gears and brass accents, its central positioning relative to the camera body is maintained. This aligns with real-world camera design principles where the lens is mounted directly in the center for optical balance and functionality.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the tripod still visibly connected to the camera through a central mount?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tripod is clearly connected to the camera via a central mounting plate, which is consistent with standard tripod attachment mechanisms. The mount is located at the base of the camera body, directly beneath the lens, and features a threaded connection point typical of camera tripods. Although the entire setup has been stylized with brass fittings and mechanical details, the structural relationship between the camera and tripod remains functional and visually coherent. This reflects real-world photography equipment design, where stability and alignment are achieved through a central mount.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the relative proportions of the camera body, lens, and tripod maintained in the steampunk rendition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the overall proportions of the camera body, lens, and tripod appear to be preserved relative to each other, despite the artistic modifications. The camera body retains its rectangular shape and size relative to the lens, which remains appropriately scaled. The tripod legs extend downward in a balanced manner, maintaining a realistic stance for support. While the steampunk style introduces additional mechanical elements like gears and pipes, these do not distort the fundamental scale relationships between the components. This suggests that the artist prioritized maintaining anatomical accuracy while adding stylistic embellishments.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the illustration retain a clear depiction of metallic textures on the camera and tripod?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic textures are highly detailed and clearly depicted across both the camera and tripod. The surfaces exhibit a variety of finishes—rusted bronze, polished brass, and aged copper—consistent with a steampunk aesthetic. These textures include visible wear, patina, rivets, and engraved patterns, all contributing to a tactile sense of metal. The lighting emphasizes these textures through highlights and shadows, enhancing their realism. This level of detail indicates that the artist intentionally emphasized metallic qualities to reinforce the industrial theme, making the textures not only present but also prominent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
