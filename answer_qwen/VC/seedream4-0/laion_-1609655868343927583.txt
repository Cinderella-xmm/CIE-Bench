    "Question": "Q1: Is the herringbone wood inlay pattern present on the surface of the transformed character?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed character's body is composed of the original cabinet structure. The herringbone wood inlay pattern, which is a distinctive feature of the cabinet’s drawers and side panels in Image A, is clearly visible on the character's torso—specifically on the front-facing drawer surfaces and the side panel. This pattern is preserved in the transformation, as the cabinet’s wooden components are reimagined into the character’s form without altering their visual texture or design. The herringbone pattern remains intact because it is an intrinsic part of the cabinet’s craftsmanship and has not been replaced or obscured by the added costume elements. Therefore, based on visual continuity and preservation of material details, the herringbone inlay is still present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the circular brass ring pulls and adjacent escutcheons present on the transformed character’s waist area, matching their original positions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the two drawers of the cabinet have been integrated into the character’s midsection, forming what appears to be a waist area. The circular brass ring pulls and adjacent escutcheons (the decorative metal plates behind the pulls) are visibly present on both drawers. Their placement corresponds exactly to their original positions on the cabinet in Image A: one set on the upper drawer and another on the lower drawer. These hardware elements remain unchanged in position and orientation, even though the drawers are now part of a larger anthropomorphic figure. Since no distortion or relocation of these components is evident, they maintain their original spatial arrangement relative to the cabinet’s structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the transformed character retain the original warm amber-brown wood color as the base tone of its body?",
    "explanation": "The body of the transformed character in Image B is constructed from the original cabinet, which features a warm amber-brown wood finish. Despite the addition of a royal robe and crown, the underlying wooden surfaces—including the drawers, side panel, and legs—are still visible and display the same warm amber-brown hue. There is no evidence of repainting or discoloration; the wood grain and tone remain consistent with the original cabinet in Image A. Thus, the base tone of the character’s body is preserved, serving as a foundation for the fantasy transformation while maintaining the original aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the transformed character’s feet retain small brass caps at their ends, corresponding to the original leg caps?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the cabinet has four tapered legs that end in small brass caps, which serve both decorative and functional purposes (protecting the wood). In Image B, the character’s feet are stylized to resemble clawed paws, but the tips of these paws feature golden, claw-like extensions that visually mimic the original brass caps. While the form has been altered into claws, the metallic gold color and placement at the extremities of the legs suggest a direct correspondence to the original brass caps. The transformation retains the idea of capped ends, albeit in a fantastical interpretation. Given that the function and position are preserved in spirit, even if not literally, the answer reflects the symbolic retention.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the legs of the transformed character still tapered, narrowing from top to bottom, consistent with the original cabinet legs?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the cabinet’s legs are distinctly tapered, becoming narrower toward the bottom. In Image B, although the legs are now part of a creature-like form with clawed feet, the overall shape of the legs maintains this tapering characteristic. From the point where the legs emerge from the cabinet body down to the feet, they gradually narrow, mirroring the original design. Even with the addition of the clawed appendages, the structural outline of the legs preserves the original tapering profile. This indicates that the transformation respects the original proportions and design intent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the two drawers/pouches positioned vertically one above the other on the transformed character, maintaining their original stacking order?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the cabinet has two drawers stacked vertically: one above the other. In Image B, these drawers are incorporated into the character’s torso and remain in the same vertical alignment. The upper drawer is positioned higher than the lower one, just as in the original cabinet. Although the drawers now appear more like pouches due to the costume overlay, their physical positioning and stacking order are unchanged. The transformation does not alter the hierarchy or sequence of the drawers, preserving their original spatial relationship.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Is the brass foliate motif visible on the side of the transformed character’s torso, in the same location as the original cabinet?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, a brass foliate (leaf-shaped) motif is located on the side of the cabinet, near the bottom edge of the side panel, just above the leg joint. In Image B, this decorative element is still present on the side of the character’s torso, at the same relative height and position. It is partially obscured by the fabric of the robe, but the ornamental brass leaf is clearly visible and aligned with its original location. The transformation has not moved or removed this detail, indicating that it was intentionally preserved as part of the cabinet’s design identity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Does the crown portion of the transformed character retain the original semi-circular edge shape of the marble top?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the cabinet has a semi-circular marble top with a smooth, curved edge. In Image B, the crown placed atop the character’s head is not derived from the marble top but is instead a separate, ornate golden crown with gemstones. The shape of the crown is polygonal and regal, not semi-circular. While the crown sits on the cabinet’s top surface, it does not replicate the original semi-circular edge of the marble top. Instead, it replaces or overlays that surface. Therefore, the original semi-circular edge is not retained in the crown portion.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q9: Do the transformed pouches retain a dark interior, suggesting depth and openness, consistent with the original drawer interiors?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the drawers are shown open, revealing dark interiors that suggest depth and emptiness. In Image B, the same drawers are open and serve as 'pouches' on the character’s torso. The inside of both drawers remains dark, with shadows indicating depth, and the openings are clearly visible. The lighting conditions highlight the contrast between the illuminated exterior and the shadowed interior, consistent with the original depiction. This suggests that the internal space has not been filled or altered, and the visual impression of openness and depth is preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"
