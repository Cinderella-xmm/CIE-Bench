      "question": "Is the vase's overall shape preserved, including its three-panel body, twin scrolled handles, and flared neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is made of clear crystal with intricate etched designs. The overall shape is consistent with a classical urn-style vase: it has a wide, rounded body divided into distinct panels, each featuring detailed engravings (including a central figure resembling a classical female form). The twin scrolled handles are clearly visible on either side of the vase, curving upward from the shoulders. The neck of the vase flares outward slightly before narrowing at the rim, which matches the description of a flared neck. These features align with the typical design of ornate vases, especially those inspired by Baroque or Rococo styles. The transparency of the material does not obscure these structural elements; instead, it enhances their visibility through light refraction and clarity. Therefore, despite the change in material from ceramic to crystal, the fundamental shape—three-panel body, twin handles, and flared neck—is preserved.",

      "question": "Does the bouquet extend beyond the rim of the vase, creating an overflowing effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bouquet consists of numerous flowers and stems that rise above the rim of the vase. The arrangement appears dense and voluminous, with multiple flower types—including daisies, delphiniums, and poppies—extending upward and outward past the top edge of the vase. Some stems are visibly bent or angled away from the center, contributing to a natural, unstructured overflow. This visual cue indicates that the bouquet is intentionally arranged to spill over the rim, creating a lush, cascading effect. This is a common stylistic choice in floral still-life compositions to emphasize abundance and natural beauty. Given the height and spread of the blooms relative to the vase’s opening, the overflowing effect is clearly present.",

      "question": "Are there scattered flowers on the surface of the pedestal, including at least one pink poppy and blue blooms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pedestal beneath the vase is reflective and dark, likely glass or polished stone. On its surface, several individual flowers are visible outside the main bouquet. Among them, there is a distinct pink poppy lying near the right side of the vase, identifiable by its soft petal structure and central yellow stamen. Additionally, small blue blooms, resembling delphiniums or similar flowers, are scattered nearby, particularly on the left side. These detached flowers appear to have fallen from the bouquet, reinforcing the sense of natural movement and realism. The presence of both pink poppies and blue flowers on the pedestal confirms the described condition.",

      "question": "Is the vase positioned centrally on the pedestal within the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is placed directly in the center of the rectangular pedestal, which is itself centered within the composition of the image. The symmetry of the arrangement is evident: the vase is aligned along the vertical axis of the frame, with equal space on either side. The reflection of the vase on the mirrored surface of the pedestal further emphasizes its central positioning. Additionally, the lighting and shadows are balanced around the vase, suggesting intentional placement for visual harmony. This central alignment is typical in formal still-life photography or art, where balance and focus are prioritized. Therefore, the vase is indeed positioned centrally.",

      "question": "Do some of the flowers rest directly on the surface of the pedestal, separate from the main bouquet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several flowers are clearly visible on the pedestal surface, independent of the main bouquet. Notably, a pink poppy and multiple blue flowers lie flat on the reflective surface, separated from the dense cluster in the vase. Their positioning suggests they have fallen or been placed deliberately apart from the primary arrangement. These isolated blooms contribute to the artistic narrative of natural imperfection and abundance. Since they are not attached to the main bouquet and are resting directly on the pedestal, they qualify as being separate from the main floral arrangement.",
