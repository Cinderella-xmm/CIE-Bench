      "question": "Is the chair supported by a five-star base with exactly five legs, each ending in a caster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair is clearly visible with a base structure that consists of five distinct legs radiating from a central point, forming a star-like shape. Each leg terminates in a caster wheel, which is consistent with typical office chair designs. The casters are transparent and appear to be made of plastic or acrylic, which is common for LEGO models. The five-leg configuration matches the standard five-star base design used in many ergonomic office chairs. This visual evidence, combined with general knowledge about office chair construction, supports the conclusion that the chair has a five-star base with five casters.",

      "question": "Is there a separate headrest cushion positioned directly above the main backrest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair features a distinct upper section of the backrest that appears elevated and separated from the main backrest. This upper portion is composed of black LEGO bricks arranged in a rectangular block, sitting directly above the segmented main backrest. Its placement and form suggest it functions as a headrest, designed to support the head. This is consistent with the design of high-back office chairs that include a separate headrest cushion. The separation between the headrest and the main backrest is visually clear, indicating it is not an integrated part but a distinct component.",

      "question": "Are there two armrests, one on each side, extending horizontally from the chair’s midsection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two armrests are visible, one on each side of the chair. They extend outward from the sides of the seat and are constructed from silver-colored LEGO pieces, matching the metallic appearance of the frame. These armrests are positioned at approximately shoulder height and project horizontally from the chair's midsection, consistent with the design of standard office chairs. Their symmetrical placement and structural alignment confirm that they serve as functional armrests. This observation aligns with common office chair ergonomics, where armrests are typically placed on both sides for balanced support.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the backrest vertically aligned behind the seat, rising from the same central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backrest of the chair is visibly positioned directly behind the seat and extends upward in a straight vertical line. It rises from the central axis of the chair, maintaining symmetry and alignment with the seat and base. The construction using LEGO bricks shows a consistent columnar structure without lateral deviation. This vertical alignment is essential for ergonomic support and is typical in office chair designs. The visual cues—such as the straight lines of the backrest and its centered position relative to the seat—confirm that it is aligned along the same central axis.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the chair maintain a tall, high-back silhouette with the headrest significantly higher than the seat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair exhibits a tall, high-back profile. The backrest extends well above the seat level, and the headrest is positioned at the top, significantly higher than the seat. The overall height of the chair, especially when considering the stacked LEGO blocks forming the backrest and headrest, indicates a high-back design. This is characteristic of executive or ergonomic office chairs intended to provide full spinal and head support. The proportions clearly show that the headrest is much higher than the seat, reinforcing the high-back silhouette.",
