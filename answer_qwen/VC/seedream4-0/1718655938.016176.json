      "question": "Is there a cross at the very top of the church's steeple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church's steeple is clearly visible and topped with a small cross. This is a common architectural feature in Christian churches, where the cross symbolizes faith and religious identity. The cross is positioned at the apex of the spire, consistent with traditional ecclesiastical design. Visual inspection confirms the presence of the cross, which stands out against the colorful sky. This aligns with world knowledge that most churches have crosses on their steeples as a signifier of their religious purpose.",

      "question": "Is there a glowing arched doorway located at the front center of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the church features an arched doorway centered on the facade. The doorway is illuminated from within, casting a warm, yellow glow that contrasts with the surrounding environment. This lighting effect suggests the interior is lit, possibly indicating activity or warmth inside. The arch shape is consistent with traditional church architecture. The glow enhances the visual focus on the entrance, making it prominent. Based on visual cues and typical church design, this matches the description of a glowing arched doorway.",

      "question": "Is there a winding dirt path extending from the foreground toward the church’s entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a clear dirt path can be seen starting from the lower portion of the image and curving gently toward the church’s entrance. The path is unpaved, composed of earthy tones, and winds through grassy terrain. It leads directly to the steps of the church, reinforcing the sense of direction and accessibility. This type of path is common in rural or whimsical settings, especially in illustrated or animated environments like the one depicted. The winding nature adds aesthetic charm and guides the viewer’s eye toward the central structure.",

      "question": "Is there a large arched stained-glass window positioned directly above the main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, directly above the main entrance of the church, there is a window with a distinct arched shape. The window is filled with colorful patterns resembling stained glass, featuring geometric designs in bright hues such as red, blue, yellow, and green. These are characteristic of stained-glass windows commonly found in churches, used both for decoration and storytelling through biblical scenes. The position above the entrance aligns with typical church architecture, where such windows serve as focal points. Therefore, based on visual evidence and architectural norms, this is indeed a large arched stained-glass window above the entrance.",

      "question": "Are there two narrow windows flanking the main doorway and one additional window visible on the side wall of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the front of the church reveals two narrow, vertically oriented windows on either side of the main entrance. These are symmetrically placed and appear to be arched at the top, matching the overall architectural style. Additionally, on the right side wall of the church (from the viewer’s perspective), there is another window visible, which is also arched and contains stained-glass elements. This configuration—two flanking windows plus one side window—is consistent with many small church designs. The presence of these three windows supports the statement in the question. Thus, based on visual observation and architectural consistency, the answer is affirmative.",
