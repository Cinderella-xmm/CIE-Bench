      "question": "Is the white tea light candle present on the black surface to the left of the bonsai pot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small white tea light candle is visible on the black surface to the left of the ornamental figure. The candle appears unlit and is placed in a metallic or dark-colored holder. This matches the description of a tea light candle commonly used for decorative lighting. The presence of this object is consistent with its appearance in Image A as well, suggesting it was retained in the edited image. The visual cues—its size, shape, color, and placement—are clear and identifiable. Based on world knowledge, tea lights are typically small, round, and placed in holders; this matches exactly. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Is the bonsai and candle resting on a flat black surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the ornamental figure and the tea light candle rest on a flat, dark surface that appears black. While the original bonsai (in Image A) is also on a similar surface, the edited image shows the same type of surface, confirming continuity in setting. The surface is smooth and uniformly colored, consistent with a flat tabletop or display platform. There are no visible textures or irregularities that would suggest otherwise. Using common sense, such surfaces are often used in product photography to provide contrast and focus attention on the subject. Thus, the statement is accurate.",

      "question": "Is the background uniformly light gray with no visible patterns or objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the ornamental figure is a plain, light gray wall. There are no discernible patterns, textures, or objects in the background. This uniformity is typical in studio photography to avoid distractions and emphasize the subject. Comparing to Image A, the background is identical in tone and texture, indicating that the editing process preserved the original backdrop. This consistency supports the conclusion that the background remains uniformly light gray without any additional elements.",

      "question": "Is the bonsai planted in a wide, shallow, teal-colored ceramic pot that occupies the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in the center is not a bonsai but a fantastical figurine with butterfly wings and antlers adorned with pink flowers. It is mounted on a stone-like base with intricate carvings, not a teal ceramic pot. Therefore, the description of a 'wide, shallow, teal-colored ceramic pot' does not apply to Image B. In Image A, however, the bonsai is indeed in such a pot, which is centrally positioned. The edit has replaced the bonsai with a different object, so the original pot is no longer present. Hence, the statement is false for Image B.",

      "question": "Are dark soil and exposed root matter visible at the surface of the pot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible pot containing soil or roots. Instead, the base of the figurine is covered with moss and integrated into a carved stone pedestal. There is no indication of dark soil or exposed root matter. In contrast, Image A clearly shows soil and some exposed root material in the bonsai pot. Since the edited image replaces the bonsai with a fantasy sculpture, the soil and roots are absent. Thus, the answer must be 'No'.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object is a fantastical creature with wings and antlers, not a bonsai tree. Although it is positioned upright and centered in the frame, it is not a bonsai. The original bonsai in Image A is indeed centrally and upright positioned. However, the question specifically refers to the bonsai, which is not present in Image B. Therefore, the bonsai is not in the image at all, making the statement false.",
