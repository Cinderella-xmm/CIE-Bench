      "question": "Are the four minarets positioned symmetrically—two on the left and two on the right—relative to the central dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural structure that resembles the Hagia Sophia has been dramatically altered. The original four minarets are no longer present in their historical configuration. Instead, a fantastical, metallic creature with wings and multiple legs has replaced the central dome and surrounding structures. The visual cues show no minarets at all—only the surreal, alien-like sculpture dominates the scene. Based on world knowledge, the real Hagia Sophia does have four minarets, two on each side of the main dome, arranged symmetrically. However, in this edited image, those features are completely absent and replaced by an artistic fantasy element. Therefore, the symmetry of the minarets cannot be observed here.",

      "question": "Is the 15 July Martyrs Bridge clearly visible in the background, crossing the water behind the Hagia Sophia?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes a body of water and distant cityscape, consistent with the location of Istanbul. However, the 15 July Martyrs Bridge (formerly known as the Bosphorus Bridge) is not clearly visible. While a bridge-like structure may be faintly suggested in the distance, it is obscured by the fantastical overlay and lacks the distinct shape and details of the actual bridge. In contrast, in Image A (the original), the bridge is visible across the water. But in Image B, due to the digital alteration involving a large, surreal metallic entity, the clarity and visibility of the bridge are compromised. Thus, based on visual analysis and world knowledge of the bridge’s appearance, it is not clearly discernible in this edited version.",

      "question": "Is a large body of water visible behind the Hagia Sophia, extending toward the horizon with boats on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the surreal transformation of the central structure, a large body of water is still visible in the background, consistent with the Bosphorus Strait seen in the original image. The water extends toward the horizon, and several small white objects resembling boats can be seen on its surface. Although the foreground has been heavily modified with a fantastical creature, the background elements—including the water and boats—remain largely intact. This matches real-world geography where the Hagia Sophia overlooks the Golden Horn and Bosphorus waters. Therefore, even with the digital alterations, the presence of the water and boats is preserved.",

      "question": "Are green trees visible in the foreground, partially obscuring the base of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground contains dense clusters of green trees, which are consistent with the natural surroundings of the Hagia Sophia complex. These trees appear to be partially obscuring the lower portions of the structure, particularly around the base of the surreal metallic creature. While the building itself has been replaced, the tree cover remains unchanged from the original scene. This aligns with real-world observations of the site, where trees surround the historic monument. Thus, the presence of green trees in the foreground, partially hiding the base, is accurate in this edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front-facing wall beneath what would normally be the central dome has been replaced by a metallic, winged creature with glowing patterns. The traditional arched windows that are characteristic of the Hagia Sophia's façade are no longer visible. Instead, the surface is covered with intricate, artificial designs that resemble mechanical or biological ornamentation. Based on world knowledge, the original Hagia Sophia features a series of arched windows below the main dome, but in this edited version, they have been entirely removed or obscured by the fantastical overlay. Therefore, these architectural details are absent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smaller domes that traditionally surround the central dome of the Hagia Sophia are no longer present. Instead, the entire structure has been transformed into a single, massive metallic creature with a central 'eye' and outstretched wings. The tiered roofline formed by secondary domes is completely replaced by this new design. While some dome-like shapes remain in the lower part of the image (possibly remnants of the original architecture), they are not clearly integrated into a tiered arrangement as in the original. Therefore, the distinctive pattern of smaller domes forming a layered roofline is not visible in this edited version.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky appears uniformly clear and light blue, consistent with daytime lighting conditions. There are no visible clouds, and the illumination suggests bright daylight, similar to the original image. Despite the dramatic changes to the central structure, the sky remains unaltered and maintains the same hue and clarity as in Image A. This matches typical weather conditions in Istanbul during sunny days. Therefore, the sky in Image B reflects a clear, cloudless day.",
