      "question": "Is the image composed of two separate panels, with one bird on the left and one on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is visually divided into two distinct vertical sections by a thin black line running down the center. On the left panel, there is an origami-style bird made of beige paper with star patterns, perched atop a decorative column. On the right panel, there is a crystalline, glass-like bird with sharp geometric facets, also perched on an identical column. The background in both panels shows an endless library corridor with bookshelves stretching into the distance, suggesting that this is a composite or split-image design. This structure confirms that the image is indeed composed of two separate panels, each featuring one bird.",

      "question": "Is the bird that was originally on the left still located in the left panel, and the bird that was originally on the right still located in the right panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A (the original), the left panel features a real bird with a light-colored breast and dark wings, while the right panel shows another real bird with black and white plumage. In Image B (the edited version), the left panel now contains an origami bird, and the right panel contains a crystal bird. Although the physical positions (left/right) are preserved, the birds themselves have been replaced with artistic interpretations. Therefore, the original birds are no longer present; they have been substituted with entirely different representations. Thus, the original birds are not still in their respective panels.",

      "question": "Does the bird on the left have its head turned toward the viewer, with its beak slightly open and facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird on the left in Image B is an origami creation. Its head is oriented directly toward the viewer, and its beak is pointed forward, resembling a slight opening due to the angular geometry of the paper folds. However, it is not a biological bird, so 'slightly open' is interpreted structurally rather than physiologically. The beak's shape suggests a forward-facing orientation, consistent with the description. Given the stylized nature of the origami, the appearance of a forward-facing, slightly open beak is accurate based on visual cues.",

      "question": "Does the bird on the right have its body angled such that its back is partially visible and it is facing left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird on the right is a transparent, faceted crystal bird. It is positioned on a pedestal with its body tilted slightly, showing the back and tail feathers, which are clearly visible. Its head is turned to the left, and its wings are spread outward, giving the impression that it is facing leftward. The angle of the body reveals part of its dorsal side, indicating that the back is partially visible. This posture aligns with the description of being angled with its back partially visible and facing left.",

      "question": "Are the feet of both birds clearly shown gripping a surface beneath them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both birds are perched on ornate columns. The origami bird on the left has folded paper legs ending in small, defined feet that appear to grip the top of the column. Similarly, the crystal bird on the right has thin, wire-like legs with clawed feet that are visibly attached to the column's surface. While these are not natural avian feet, they are artistically rendered to suggest gripping. Both sets of feet are clearly depicted in contact with the surface, implying a secure hold. Therefore, the feet are clearly shown as gripping the surface.",

      "question": "Do both birds maintain an upright, balanced silhouette with a distinct head, body, and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both birds in Image B exhibit a clear and balanced upright posture. The origami bird on the left has a defined head, a segmented body, and a tail formed from folded paper, all contributing to a coherent silhouette. The crystal bird on the right similarly has a distinct head, a well-formed body, and a visible tail, all structured with geometric precision. Despite being non-natural materials, both figures retain a recognizable avian form with proportional separation between head, body, and tail. Their silhouettes are stable and symmetrical, suggesting balance and structural integrity.",
