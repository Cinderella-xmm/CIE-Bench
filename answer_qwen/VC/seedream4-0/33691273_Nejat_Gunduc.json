      "question": "Is the Coca-Cola bottle present in the advertisement with its distinctive curved shape and visible partial logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the advertisement features a woman holding a bottle that clearly displays the iconic curved silhouette of a Coca-Cola bottle. The shape is unmistakable due to its unique contour, which is a hallmark of Coca-Cola's branding. Additionally, part of the label on the bottle is visible, showing the word 'Coca-Cola' in its signature script font, confirming both the brand and product identity. This visual evidence aligns with world knowledge about Coca-Cola’s packaging design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white earbud visible in the woman’s ear with the wire extending downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman in the advertisement is depicted wearing a white earbud in her right ear. The earbud is clearly visible, and the thin wire extends from it down along her neck and shoulder area, consistent with typical wired earphone designs. This detail is coherent with common representations of modern audio devices in advertising imagery.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both the man and the woman shown in profile, facing to the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is standing in profile, facing to the right, as seen by his posture and orientation relative to the camera. Similarly, the woman in the advertisement is also shown in profile, looking toward the right side of the frame. Both figures are aligned in the same direction, creating a visual parallel between them. This alignment enhances the thematic contrast or connection implied by the image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the man’s right hand positioned near his ear, holding the earbud in a manner that mimics the woman’s use?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is not holding an earbud; instead, he stands with his hands in his pockets, looking at the advertisement. There is no visible earbud in his hand or near his ear. While the woman in the ad is shown holding an earbud to her ear, the man does not replicate this action. Therefore, there is no mimicry of the woman’s gesture by the man.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the top-right corner of the advertisement visibly torn or peeling, revealing the underlying surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-right corner of the advertisement shows signs of wear and tear. A noticeable tear or peel is visible, where the edge of the poster appears lifted or damaged, exposing the darker surface beneath. This detail suggests aging or weathering of the billboard, consistent with outdoor advertising materials exposed to environmental conditions over time.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the man positioned in front of the advertisement, partially overlapping it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is standing directly in front of the advertisement, but he does not visually overlap with the image of the woman. His body is fully separate from the poster, and there is no blending or layering effect that would suggest partial overlap. He is positioned beside it, not superimposed upon it. Thus, while he is near the ad, he does not partially cover it.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the word \"Coca\" or \"Coca-Cola\" legible on the bottle in the advertisement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle held by the woman clearly displays the 'Coca-Cola' logo in its classic script font. Although the full name may not be entirely visible due to the angle, the word 'Coca' is distinctly readable on the label. Furthermore, the text 'Coca-Cola NOIR' is printed below the image, reinforcing the brand identity. This confirms that the brand name is indeed legible.",
