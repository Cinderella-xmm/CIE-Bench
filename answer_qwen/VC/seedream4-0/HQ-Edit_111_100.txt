    "Question": "Q1: Is the fan-shaped headdress with radiating elements present on the warrior’s head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior's head is adorned with a headdress that features a distinct fan-like structure composed of multiple vertical, rectangular elements arranged in a semi-circular pattern, resembling radiating feathers or plates. This design is consistent with traditional representations of Mesoamerican warriors, such as Aztec or Maya figures, who often wore elaborate headdresses symbolizing status or divine connection. The visual cues—such as the layered, upward-pointing segments and symmetrical arrangement—strongly suggest a fan-shaped, radiating headdress. Based on this observation and cultural knowledge of pre-Columbian iconography, the answer is affirmative.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a circular emblem located at the center of the chest plate?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior's chest plate is clearly visible and features a central circular element with a detailed inner design, including concentric rings and what appears to be a symbolic motif (possibly an eye or sun-like figure). This circular emblem is positioned directly at the center of the torso, surrounded by angular, blocky armor pieces typical of LEGO-style construction. The presence of such a design aligns with common motifs in ancient warrior attire, where central emblems represented spiritual or clan symbols. The visual evidence supports the existence of a circular emblem at the chest's center.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is a spear held in the warrior’s right hand?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior's right hand is extended downward and holds a long, slender object with a pointed tip, consistent with the shape and form of a spear. The object has a shaft and a sharp end, which are characteristic features of a spear. Additionally, the positioning of the hand and the object suggests it is being grasped firmly, indicating active holding. This matches both the visual cues and general expectations of how weapons are depicted in warrior statues. Therefore, the object in the right hand is indeed a spear.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the torso and legs covered in layered, scale-like armor pieces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior's torso and legs are constructed from numerous interlocking, rectangular blocks arranged in overlapping patterns that resemble scales. These elements are stacked horizontally and vertically, creating a textured, segmented appearance typical of scale armor. While the material is clearly LEGO bricks rather than metal or leather, the design mimics the look of traditional scale armor worn by ancient warriors. The visual repetition and layering of these pieces strongly suggest a scale-like covering across both the torso and legs.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the statue placed on a white pedestal with two visible plaques at the front?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior statue stands on a clean, white, rectangular pedestal. At the front of the pedestal, two small, flat rectangular objects are visible, each containing text or information—consistent with museum display plaques. These plaques are positioned symmetrically and appear to provide details about the exhibit. The placement and design match standard museum practices for labeling artifacts. Thus, the statue is indeed on a white pedestal with two visible plaques.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are framed landscape artworks visible on both side walls of the gallery?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the left and right walls of the gallery each display multiple framed artworks. These frames contain images that depict natural scenes, such as trees, foliage, and earthy tones, consistent with landscape paintings. The artworks are evenly spaced and mounted at eye level, typical of gallery exhibitions. On both sides, at least three such framed pieces are visible, confirming the presence of landscape artworks on both walls.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the statue centered in the gallery space with equal spacing to the side walls?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is positioned along the central axis of the gallery, equidistant from both the left and right walls. The symmetry of the room, including the lighting fixtures, railings, and artwork placement, reinforces this central alignment. The perspective of the image shows parallel lines converging behind the statue, indicating it is precisely centered. This layout is typical of museum displays designed to emphasize the importance of the central exhibit. Therefore, the statue is centered with equal spacing to the side walls.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is a shield-like object held in the warrior’s left hand?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior's left hand is holding a flat, elongated object with a rounded top and a straight edge, resembling a shield. However, upon closer inspection, this object appears to be a ceremonial blade or dagger rather than a shield, given its narrow shape and pointed tip. It lacks the broad, protective surface typical of a shield. Instead, it resembles a ritual weapon. Therefore, while it is held in the left hand, it is not a shield-like object.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q9: Does the warrior have a broad nose, deep-set eyes, and a stern mouth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior's facial features are clearly defined despite the blocky LEGO construction. The nose is wide and prominent, consistent with a 'broad' description. The eyes are recessed within the face, giving them a 'deep-set' appearance, which adds to the stern expression. The mouth is closed and angled downward, contributing to a serious, unyielding demeanor. These features are stylized but still convey the intended traits of a formidable warrior. Even with the pixelated nature of the LEGO design, the facial characteristics align with the description of a broad nose, deep-set eyes, and a stern mouth.",
    "answer": "Yes"
