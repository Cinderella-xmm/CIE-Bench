    "Question": "Q1: Is the text 'NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK, WASHINGTON, D.C.' present at the top center of the image?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the top center of the image contains a line of text. The visual content clearly shows capitalized letters spelling out 'NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK, WASHINGTON, D.C.', which matches the exact phrasing in the question. This text is positioned centrally at the top, consistent with typical vintage postcard formatting where institutional or location information is placed for identification. The font and layout are consistent with historical design elements seen in mid-20th-century zoo-related imagery. Based on this visual evidence and common knowledge about such archival-style images, the presence of this text can be confirmed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the text 'WART HOG' present at the bottom center of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, at the bottom center of the image, there is a label written in capital letters. The text reads 'WART HOG', which directly corresponds to the name of the animal depicted. This placement is typical in educational or zoological illustrations, where the subject's name is labeled beneath the image for identification. The font style and positioning align with the format seen in vintage postcards, reinforcing its authenticity as part of the image’s design. Therefore, based on direct visual observation and contextual understanding of such media, the answer is confirmed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the ground beneath the warthog covered with dry, pale yellow straw?",
    "explanation": "The ground in Image B is covered with a textured layer that visually resembles straw. The color is predominantly pale yellow with some darker strands, consistent with dried grass or hay. The texture appears fibrous and loosely scattered, matching the appearance of straw commonly used in animal enclosures for bedding. While it could be interpreted as dry grass, the overall look—especially the uniformity and color—is most consistent with straw. Given the context of a zoo enclosure (as indicated by the text), using straw as bedding is plausible. Thus, based on visual cues and real-world knowledge of animal habitats, the ground is best described as covered with dry, pale yellow straw.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the background behind the warthog a dark green-brown gradient, resembling an indoor or shaded enclosure?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B displays a gradient transitioning from dark green to brown tones, creating a sense of depth and shadow. This coloration and lack of natural lighting suggest an enclosed or shaded environment, possibly simulating a forested or indoor habitat. The absence of bright sunlight, sky, or open landscape supports the interpretation of a controlled setting like a zoo enclosure. Furthermore, the blurred and indistinct nature of the background enhances the focus on the subject, a common technique in staged photographs or artistic renderings of animals in captivity. Combined with the known context of the National Zoological Park, this background is consistent with an indoor or shaded enclosure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a white border surrounding the image, separating the artwork from the edges?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a distinct white margin around the entire perimeter of the central illustration. This border separates the main artwork from the outer edge of the image, forming a frame-like structure. This design element is characteristic of vintage postcards and printed illustrations, where a border provides visual separation and enhances presentation. The width of the border is uniform, and its color is consistently white, confirming its presence. This is a deliberate stylistic choice often used in archival or collectible images, especially those associated with zoos or educational institutions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the code '5A-H618' present in the bottom right corner of the image?",
    "explanation": "In the bottom right corner of Image B, there is a small alphanumeric code visible. Upon close inspection, the text reads '5A-H618'. This code is positioned precisely in the lower-right area, consistent with cataloging or identification numbers used in historical postcards or photographic series. Such codes were often included for inventory or printing purposes. The font and placement match those found in similar archival materials. Therefore, based on direct visual confirmation and contextual understanding of such labeling practices, the code is indeed present.",
    "answer": "Yes"
