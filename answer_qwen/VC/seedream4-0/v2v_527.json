      "question": "Does the LEGO-style dog retain the golden color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is constructed from LEGO-like blocks and is predominantly yellow in color. The term 'golden' typically refers to a shade of yellow that resembles gold, which aligns with the color of the LEGO dog. Although it is not metallic gold, the hue is consistent with what one might describe as 'golden' in a figurative or visual sense. Therefore, based on visual cues and common usage of the term 'golden' to describe light yellow tones (especially in reference to dogs like Golden Retrievers), the dog retains the golden color.",

      "question": "Is the stop sign still octagonal in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stop sign in Image B is clearly depicted as an eight-sided polygon, which is the standard shape for stop signs worldwide. This octagonal shape is preserved even though the sign is made of LEGO bricks. The structure maintains its geometric integrity, with each side being approximately equal in length and forming right angles at the corners. This matches real-world traffic signage standards, confirming that the shape remains octagonal despite the material change.",

      "question": "Does the stop sign retain the white \"STOP\" text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stop sign in Image B features the word 'STOP' spelled out using white LEGO bricks. These bricks are arranged to form bold, blocky letters that match the typical font used on real stop signs. The contrast between the red background and white lettering is preserved, ensuring high visibility. Although the texture is pixelated due to the LEGO construction, the text remains legible and visually consistent with standard stop sign design. Thus, the white 'STOP' text is retained.",

      "question": "Is the LEGO-style dog still positioned sitting atop the stop sign?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO dog is clearly seated directly on top of the stop sign, mirroring the posture seen in the original image. Its legs are placed symmetrically over the upper edge of the sign, and its body is upright, maintaining the same spatial relationship as in Image A. The positioning suggests intentional placement to replicate the original scene, albeit in a stylized, constructed form. This confirms that the dog remains sitting atop the stop sign.",

      "question": "Is the background represented with gradient shading to depict the blue sky and clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B shows a clear blue sky with soft white clouds. There is a visible gradient effect where the sky transitions from a lighter blue near the horizon to a deeper blue higher up, which is a common technique used to simulate depth and realism in digital imagery. The clouds are rendered with subtle shading and soft edges, enhancing the three-dimensional appearance. This use of gradient shading effectively conveys the illusion of a natural sky, consistent with how such backgrounds are often represented in photography and digital art.",
