    "Question": "Q1: Are the three figures positioned such that one is on the left, one in the center, and one on the right from the viewer's perspective?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the composition clearly shows three distinct figures arranged horizontally across the frame. From the viewer’s perspective, there is a figure on the far left, one centrally located, and another on the far right. This arrangement is symmetrical and balanced, typical of group portraits or promotional imagery. The spacing between them is even, and their alignment suggests intentional positioning for visual impact. Based on standard compositional principles in photography and art, this layout corresponds to a left-center-right configuration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the central figure standing fully upright with both feet on the rock and facing forward?",
    "explanation": "The central figure in Image B appears to be standing straight and tall, with his body oriented directly toward the camera. His posture is erect, and both feet are visibly placed on the dark rock formation beneath him. There is no indication of leaning or imbalance. The symmetry of his stance and the alignment of his limbs suggest he is fully upright and stable. Additionally, the lighting highlights his front-facing position, reinforcing that he is looking directly forward.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the ocean visible in the background behind the figures, with waves breaking against rocks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a coastal scene at sunset. The horizon reveals water with visible wave activity, including white foam and motion consistent with waves crashing against rocky outcrops. The texture and coloration of the water—especially the contrast between the darker sea and the bright foam—indicate active surf. The presence of rocks extending into the water further supports the idea that waves are breaking against them. This aligns with typical coastal dynamics during low tide or moderate surf conditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the figures standing on dark, jagged rock formations in the foreground?",
    "explanation": "The figures in Image B are indeed positioned on prominent, dark-colored rock formations. These rocks have irregular, angular shapes and rough textures, characteristic of volcanic or basaltic formations commonly found along coastlines. Their jagged edges and uneven surfaces contribute to a dramatic, natural setting. The shadows and highlights on the rocks emphasize their three-dimensionality and ruggedness, confirming they are solid, natural structures rather than artificial platforms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sun positioned directly behind the central figure, creating a bright glow between his legs?",
    "explanation": "The sun is visible as a bright, glowing orb near the horizon, situated directly behind the central figure. The light radiates outward, casting a warm orange and yellow glow that appears to pass between the figure’s legs. This creates a silhouette effect and emphasizes the backlighting. Such positioning is common in sunset photography and enhances the dramatic atmosphere. The glow is concentrated and aligned with the lower part of the central figure’s body, confirming it passes between his legs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a clear horizon line separating the sky from the ocean in the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horizon is distinctly visible as a horizontal boundary where the sky meets the ocean. The gradient of colors—from deep blue at the top to warm oranges and pinks near the horizon—clearly demarcates this line. The ocean surface below the horizon reflects these hues, and the transition is smooth and unbroken. This clarity is enhanced by the absence of fog or haze, allowing for a sharp separation between the two elements. The horizon serves as a key compositional element in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the figure on the right have long, wavy hair extending past the shoulders?",
    "explanation": "The figure on the right in Image B has long hair that flows down past the shoulders. The hair appears wavy and voluminous, with movement suggesting it may be slightly tousled by wind. Its length extends well beyond the shoulder line, reaching approximately mid-back. This hairstyle is consistent with fantasy or epic character designs, often used to convey a sense of mystique or otherworldliness. The lighting accentuates the texture and flow of the hair, making its length and style clearly discernible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Does the figure on the left have curly, light brown hair reaching past the shoulders?",
    "explanation": "The figure on the left in Image B has long, curly hair that reaches past the shoulders. The curls are defined and appear to be a shade of light brown or golden-brown, especially noticeable under the warm sunset lighting. The hair cascades naturally over the shoulders and back, contributing to the character’s overall appearance. While some variation in tone may occur due to lighting, the base color and texture are consistent with light brown curls. This matches the description provided in the question.",
    "answer": "Yes"
