      "question": "Are the orange fields with black veins and white spots along the wing margins present in the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly displays wings with prominent orange coloration segmented by black veins, which is characteristic of a monarch butterfly. Along the outer margins of both forewings and hindwings, there are clearly visible white spots. These features align with the typical morphology of a monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), where the wings have orange fields outlined by black borders and dotted with white spots. The visual evidence in Image B confirms these traits, even though the artistic style is stylized. Therefore, the presence of orange fields with black veins and white spots along the wing margins is accurate.",

      "question": "Are there clearly defined white spots located along the outer edge of both forewings and hindwings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the outer edges of both the forewings and hindwings of the butterfly show a series of small, distinct white spots arranged along the black border. This pattern is consistent with the natural appearance of monarch butterflies, where such white spots serve as a defining trait. Even though the image is artistically rendered, the placement and clarity of these spots are preserved. Thus, based on the visual cues and biological knowledge of monarch butterflies, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly’s body black with small white speckles distributed across it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's body is depicted as black, which matches the typical coloration of a monarch butterfly. Additionally, small white speckles are visible across the thorax and abdomen, resembling the natural spotting found on real monarchs. While this detail may be slightly exaggerated for artistic effect, the overall representation is consistent with known biological features. Hence, the description of the body being black with white speckles is accurate within the context of the image.",

      "question": "Is there a flower with a spiky central cone and drooping petals beneath the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, directly beneath the butterfly, there is a flower that exhibits a spiky central cone surrounded by drooping, elongated petals. This structure is characteristic of coneflowers (Echinacea spp.), which are commonly associated with monarch butterflies in their natural habitat. The flower's morphology—spiky center and downward-curving petals—is clearly visible and matches the described traits. Therefore, the presence of such a flower is confirmed.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned directly above the flower, with its legs touching the bloom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is illustrated hovering slightly above the flower, but its legs are not visibly making contact with the bloom. Instead, the butterfly appears to be mid-air, holding a conductor's baton, suggesting an anthropomorphic or whimsical interpretation. While the flower is positioned directly below the butterfly, there is no clear indication that the legs are touching it. In contrast, in Image A, the butterfly's legs do appear to be resting on the flower. However, since the question pertains only to Image B, and based on visual analysis, the legs are not touching the bloom. Therefore, the correct answer is 'No'.",
