      "question": "Does the badge incorporate the Statue of Liberty holding a torch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge features a central figure that is clearly identifiable as the Statue of Liberty due to its iconic green patina, crown with spikes, and flowing robes. The figure is depicted raising one arm upward, holding a torch aloft, which is consistent with the well-known pose of the Statue of Liberty. This visual cue, combined with world knowledge that the Statue of Liberty is famously associated with holding a torch, confirms that the statue on the badge is indeed shown holding a torch. The torch is positioned at the top of the raised arm and has a flame, further reinforcing this identification.",

      "question": "Is the Eiffel Tower depicted with its signature metal framework on the badge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two structures resembling the Eiffel Tower are visible on either side of the Statue of Liberty within the circular badge. These structures feature the characteristic lattice-like metal framework, tapering shape, and intricate ironwork that define the Eiffel Tower's architectural style. Although the depiction is stylized, the key elements such as the triangular base, vertical supports, and cross-bracing are present, aligning with the real-world design of the Eiffel Tower. Therefore, despite artistic simplification, the signature metal framework is recognizable.",

      "question": "Does the London Eye appear as a circular structure with gondolas on the badge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, behind the Statue of Liberty and between the two Eiffel Towers, there is a large circular structure with evenly spaced enclosed capsules along its circumference. This matches the appearance of the London Eye, a giant Ferris wheel located in London. The gondolas (capsules) are depicted as small, rounded pods attached to the rim of the circle, which is consistent with the real-life design of the London Eye. Although the image is stylized, the circular form and presence of gondolas confirm it as a representation of the London Eye.",

      "question": "Are the Statue of Liberty, Eiffel Tower, and London Eye arranged together on the badge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge contains three major landmarks: the Statue of Liberty in the center, flanked by two Eiffel Towers on either side, and the London Eye positioned behind the central figure. These elements are all contained within the circular frame of the badge, creating a composite scene where all three global icons are displayed together. While their actual geographical locations are not accurate (as they are in different cities), the artistic arrangement places them in close proximity on the badge, indicating a symbolic or souvenir-style composition. Thus, they are visually grouped together on the badge.",

      "question": "Is there a hand prominently holding the badge in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a human hand is clearly visible in the lower portion of the image, gripping the edge of the circular badge. The fingers and thumb are detailed, showing skin texture and natural positioning, and the badge is held between the thumb and forefinger. This hand is in sharp focus and occupies a significant portion of the foreground, making it a prominent element of the composition. The perspective suggests the viewer is seeing the badge through the eyes of someone holding it, emphasizing its role as an object being presented.",
