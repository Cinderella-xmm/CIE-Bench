      "question": "Are the toasters still rectangular with a smooth metallic finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two toasters are clearly visible and maintain a rectangular shape with clean, straight edges. Their surfaces exhibit a polished, smooth metallic finish typical of stainless steel appliances. This appearance is consistent with standard toaster design and reflects light uniformly, indicating a smooth texture. Based on visual cues such as the even reflection and lack of texture or irregularities, it can be concluded that the toasters retain their rectangular form and smooth metallic finish. No distortions or changes in shape are observed.",

      "question": "Is the bread still rising slightly above the toaster slots with visible toast marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both slices of bread are positioned in the toaster slots and extend slightly above the opening, which is typical for toasting bread. The surface of the bread shows golden-brown coloration with darker spots indicative of toast marks, suggesting they have been toasted. These marks are consistent with heat exposure from a toaster. The bread appears to be evenly toasted and maintains its structural integrity, confirming that it has risen slightly above the slot as expected during toasting. This aligns with common knowledge about how bread behaves in a toaster.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each toaster clearly features a black lever on the side, used to lower and raise the bread, and a black rotary knob on the front, which controls the toasting level. These components are standard features on modern toasters and are visibly intact. The placement and design match typical toaster controls. There is no indication of missing or altered parts. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and common toaster design, the black control knobs and levers are still present.",

      "question": "Do the toasters retain their reflective metallic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters display a strong reflective quality, with highlights and reflections visible on their surfaces, especially where light hits them directly. This reflectivity is characteristic of polished stainless steel, which is commonly used in toaster construction. The shine is consistent across both units, indicating that the metallic sheen has not diminished or been obscured. Even under outdoor lighting conditions, the surface remains glossy and reflective, confirming the retention of the original metallic finish.",

      "question": "Are the two toasters still placed side by side on the same surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two toasters are positioned next to each other on a flat, portable table, which appears to be made of metal or composite material suitable for outdoor use. They are aligned horizontally and rest on the same surface without any gaps or elevation differences between them. This arrangement mirrors typical usage scenarios where multiple appliances are placed together for convenience. The background suggests an outdoor camping setting, but the toasters remain side by side on the same table, maintaining their relative positioning. Thus, the placement has not changed in terms of adjacency and shared surface.",
