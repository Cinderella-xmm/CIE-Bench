      "question": "Is there a long, continuous road-like structure extending into the distance, serving as the central axis of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central area features a geometrically stylized representation of a road that extends from the foreground to the vanishing point in the distance. The road is composed of triangular and rectangular patches of fabric in shades of gray, yellow, and white, forming a clear path that draws the viewer’s eye forward. This structure is symmetrical and maintains continuity throughout the image, functioning as the dominant compositional axis. The use of perspective through converging lines reinforces the sense of depth and direction, consistent with how roads are depicted in visual art to guide focus. Therefore, despite the abstract nature of the artwork, the road-like structure is clearly present and serves as the central axis.",

      "question": "Are there visible diagonal streaks or patterns indicating falling rain across the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is an embroidered textile artwork using geometric shapes and color blocks to represent a landscape. There are no diagonal streaks or translucent overlays that would suggest rain. Instead, the sky is composed of angular, triangular forms in varying shades of green, beige, and gray, which abstractly represent clouds or terrain. Rain is not depicted through any pattern resembling streaks or droplets. In contrast, real-world depictions of rain often include diagonal lines or blurred effects to simulate motion, but such elements are absent here. The artistic style relies on abstraction rather than realistic weather effects. Therefore, there are no visible indications of falling rain.",

      "question": "Are there tall vertical structures with horizontal crossbars positioned along the right side of the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, along the right side of the road, there are dark vertical lines with horizontal crossbars at the top—these are stylized representations of utility poles (likely power or telephone poles). They are evenly spaced and decrease in size as they recede into the distance, following linear perspective. These structures are clearly visible and match the description of tall vertical supports with crossbars. Their placement along the right edge of the road aligns with common infrastructure design in rural roadways. While abstracted, their form and positioning confirm their identity as utility poles.",

      "question": "Are there tree-like forms present on both sides of the road, aligned with the guardrails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on both sides of the road, there are clusters of triangular and polygonal shapes in various shades of green and dark tones. These forms are arranged in a way that suggests foliage or trees, particularly on the left side where larger, more defined triangular masses appear. On the right, similar green shapes are present, though less dense. These are positioned adjacent to the roadside areas, corresponding to where trees might grow near guardrails. Although abstract, the arrangement and coloration mimic natural vegetation typical of roadside landscapes. Thus, tree-like forms are indeed present on both sides, aligned with the road edges.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a visible division in the sky between dark clouds and a brighter, illuminated area near the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is composed of fragmented geometric shapes in different hues—darker greens and grays in the upper regions, transitioning to lighter yellows and beiges toward the horizon. This gradient suggests a contrast between darker, cloud-like areas and a brighter zone near the horizon, mimicking the effect of light breaking through storm clouds. While not rendered realistically, the color transition and spatial arrangement imply a division between shadowed and illuminated parts of the sky, consistent with atmospheric lighting during dawn or dusk. This visual cue, combined with common artistic conventions for depicting sky illumination, supports the presence of such a division.",

      "question": "Are there barrier-like structures running along both edges of the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, along both the left and right edges of the road, there are narrow, elongated strips of fabric in darker tones (such as gray or black) that run parallel to the road's length. These strips are separated from the road by a band of green, suggesting grass or shoulder space. Their consistent width and alignment indicate they are stylized representations of guardrails or barriers. In real-world contexts, guardrails are commonly placed along road edges for safety, and their presence here, though abstracted, follows this functional layout. The symmetry and positioning confirm their role as barrier-like structures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the center of the road features a prominent yellow triangular shape that extends from the foreground toward the horizon. This yellow area is segmented into multiple triangular patches, creating a continuous visual path down the middle of the road. Although it is not a solid line like in a photograph, the yellow segments are aligned in a way that clearly represents a centerline, consistent with the yellow dividing lines used on roads. The stylized nature of the artwork does not eliminate the intent or function of this feature—it remains a continuous, central yellow element, fulfilling the role of a road centerline.",
