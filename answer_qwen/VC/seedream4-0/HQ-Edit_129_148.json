      "question": "Is the green dress with red and orange circular patterns (some with internal dot textures) preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is wearing a dress that features a vibrant green base with large circular patterns in red and orange. Upon closer inspection, some of these circles contain internal dot textures, which are characteristic of certain African textile designs such as those found in Kente or Ankara fabrics. The pattern is consistent across the bodice and skirt, and the overall design matches the description provided. The fabric appears to be rendered with attention to detail, preserving both the color scheme and pattern complexity. No significant changes or distortions are observed in the pattern or color distribution.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted sitting inside a globe-like structure. Her posture shows her legs crossed and her hands placed gently on her lap, with fingers slightly interlocked. This positioning is consistent with a seated pose where the hands rest naturally on the lap. The lighting and shadows further confirm the spatial relationship between her arms and torso, indicating that she is not holding anything or gesturing. This posture aligns with the described position and is clearly preserved in the edited image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s neck displays multiple layers of what appear to be silver-colored necklaces. These necklaces are stacked closely together, forming a choker-like arrangement that extends down the upper chest. The metallic sheen and reflective quality suggest they are made of silver or a similar material. The number and layering of the necklaces match the typical appearance of traditional African jewelry, often worn in ceremonial contexts. The continuity and clarity of the necklaces in the image indicate they have been preserved without any apparent modification or omission.",

The texture and shine suggest they are metallic, likely gold or gold-toned. The placement and number of bangles are clearly visible and match the description. There is no indication of their removal or alteration in the edited version.",

Her eyes are almond-shaped, with well-defined eyelashes and a soft gaze, contributing to a calm and composed expression. The symmetry of her facial features, including the shape of the nose and lips, remains consistent with the original depiction. There are no signs of digital distortion or exaggeration in the facial structure. The lighting enhances the natural contours of her face, reinforcing the preservation of these features.",
