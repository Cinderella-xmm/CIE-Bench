      "question": "Are the floral embroidery patterns on the sleeves and collar of the hanbok clearly visible and in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral embroidery patterns on the sleeves and collar of the hanbok are rendered in a layered, papercut-style design. The patterns are clearly visible due to the high contrast between the white background and the colorful floral motifs. These motifs include pink, red, yellow, and blue flowers with green stems, which are consistent with traditional Korean hanbok designs. The positioning of the embroidery appears to be preserved relative to the original placement on a real hanbok—on the outer edges of the sleeves and along the collar—indicating that they are in their original positions. Although the artistic style is stylized, the layout aligns with cultural and aesthetic norms of hanbok decoration. Therefore, based on visual analysis and knowledge of traditional Korean attire, the patterns are both visible and correctly positioned.",

      "question": "Is the jeogori light pink and the chima sky-blue in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jeogori (the upper garment) is depicted in a cream or off-white tone rather than light pink. This is evident from the overall monochromatic base of the paper art, where colors are applied selectively but not as vividly as in a photographic representation. The chima (the skirt) appears in a pale blue shade, closer to sky-blue, though it lacks the depth and saturation seen in realistic depictions. However, the primary issue lies in the jeogori’s color—it is not light pink but rather a neutral beige or ivory hue. This deviation is due to the artistic medium used (papercut), which prioritizes contrast and form over accurate color reproduction. Based on this observation and understanding of how color is interpreted in stylized artwork, the answer must reflect the actual visual content.",

      "question": "Is there a golden-yellow ribbon tied in a bow at the center of the chest on the jeogori?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a prominent ribbon is visible at the center of the chest, tied into a bow. Its color is distinctly golden-yellow, matching the traditional 'dallyeong' (bow) used in hanbok attire. The ribbon's shape and placement are consistent with historical and cultural representations of hanbok, where the bow is centered and tied securely. Even within the papercut style, the ribbon retains its three-dimensional appearance through layering and shading, confirming its presence and correct position. This aligns with both visual cues and world knowledge about Korean traditional clothing.",

      "question": "Is the background a traditional Korean palace with multiple curved roofs, red pillars, and green decorative beams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a stylized depiction of a traditional Korean palace, rendered in papercut form. The structure includes multiple curved roofs with upward-sweeping eaves, characteristic of palaces like Gyeongbokgung. Red pillars are visible beneath the roof sections, and green decorative elements can be seen in the beam details, consistent with traditional Korean architectural design. Although the image is simplified and abstracted due to the artistic medium, the key architectural features—curved roofs, red columns, and green accents—are present and recognizable. This matches known examples of Korean royal architecture, supporting the conclusion that the background represents such a palace.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s hair is styled in an elaborate updo typical of traditional Korean fashion. The hair is arranged in a high bun, and several hairpins are visible. Among them, a central pendant-shaped pin stands out due to its elongated, vertical design, resembling a traditional 'binyeo' or 'jokduri'. While the material cannot be definitively identified as silver due to the monochrome nature of the papercut, the design and placement are consistent with traditional Korean hair accessories. The presence of multiple pins and the central pendant-like element confirm the accuracy of the description based on cultural knowledge of Korean hairstyles.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman wears earrings that hang down from her ears. They are long and feature intricate geometric patterns, consistent with traditional Korean jewelry styles such as 'jeoseung' or 'dangui'. The design includes layered elements and small dangling parts, which are clearly visible on both ears. Despite the stylized nature of the artwork, the earrings maintain symmetry and detail, indicating intentional representation. This aligns with common depictions of ornate earrings in Korean cultural attire.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small bag is visible over the woman’s right shoulder. It has a pink body and a thin, gold-colored chain strap. The bag's shape and proportions match those of a modern crossbody purse. While the design is stylized, the color and structure are clearly distinguishable. The pink hue is consistent with the original image's depiction, and the gold chain is represented through fine lines and metallic shading. This combination confirms the presence of the described accessory, even within the artistic interpretation.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is centrally placed in the foreground, with the palace structure behind her. She is facing directly toward the viewer, as indicated by the symmetrical alignment of her face, shoulders, and posture. The composition places her in front of the palace, maintaining spatial depth. This arrangement is consistent with both visual perspective and typical portrait conventions. The papercut technique preserves this frontal orientation, reinforcing the idea that she is positioned in front of the palace and facing forward.",
