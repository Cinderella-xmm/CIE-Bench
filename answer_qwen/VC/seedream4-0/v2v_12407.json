      "question": "Is the mango depicted with an oval shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango appears to have a generally oval shape, despite the pixelation. The overall form is elongated and rounded, consistent with the typical shape of a mango. Although the pixelation reduces fine detail, the silhouette still suggests an oval contour. This conclusion is supported by common knowledge that mangoes are typically oval or kidney-shaped fruits. The visual cues in the image—such as the smooth curvature and proportions—align with this expectation.",

      "question": "Is there a small stem visible at the top of the mango?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small dark protrusion at the top of the mango, which corresponds to the stem. Even though the image is pixelated, this feature is distinguishable due to its distinct color contrast and position at the apex of the fruit. In real-world contexts, mangoes often retain a small stem at the top after harvesting. The presence of this feature aligns with both visual evidence and biological knowledge about mango morphology.",

      "question": "Is the paper towel folded into a cradle-like shape beneath the mango?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The paper towel in Image B is folded in such a way that it forms a supportive structure under the mango. The folds create a bowl-like or cradle-like shape, holding the mango securely. This is evident from the way the edges curve upward around the base of the fruit. This folding technique is commonly used to prevent slipping or damage to delicate items. The pixelated rendering still allows for recognition of this functional fold pattern based on the spatial arrangement of the paper towel's layers.",

      "question": "Are there four clearly defined flaps extending from the paper towel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the paper towel has multiple sections that extend outward, but due to pixelation, it is difficult to definitively count them. However, visually, there appear to be four distinct angular flaps radiating from the center, forming a star-like pattern. This is consistent with how a square paper towel might be folded into a cradle shape, creating four symmetrical flaps. While the pixelation blurs the edges, the general symmetry and layout suggest four flaps, which matches typical folding patterns for such setups.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango and the paper towel are located near the center of the visible portion of the table. The surrounding space on all sides appears balanced, with no significant asymmetry in the composition. Although the full extent of the table is not visible, the placement relative to the frame suggests central positioning. This is further supported by photographic conventions where subjects are often centered for visual balance. Therefore, based on visual cues and compositional norms, the mango appears to be centrally placed.",

      "question": "Does the table show a horizontal wood grain pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wooden surface with visible lines running horizontally across the table. These lines represent the wood grain, which is characteristic of natural wood surfaces. Despite the pixelation, the directionality of these lines is clear and consistent with horizontal alignment. In real-world settings, wood grain patterns are often visible and can vary in direction; here, they run parallel to the bottom edge of the image, indicating a horizontal orientation. This observation is reinforced by the lighting and shadow effects that follow the same directional pattern.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a brown structure with vertical and horizontal elements visible in the upper right background. This structure resembles the backrest and frame of a wooden chair. Its shape, color, and positioning relative to the table are consistent with a typical dining chair. The pixelation does not obscure the basic form enough to rule out this identification. Based on common household furniture arrangements, a chair placed behind a table is plausible, and the visual evidence supports this interpretation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a darkened area extending diagonally from the mango toward the lower left corner of the frame. This shadow is consistent with the angle of light coming from the upper right, casting a diagonal shadow. Shadows from objects on flat surfaces typically extend away from the light source, and the direction and shape of this shadow match that expected behavior. The pixelation slightly distorts the edges, but the overall pattern remains recognizable as a diagonal shadow. This aligns with physical principles of light and shadow projection.",
