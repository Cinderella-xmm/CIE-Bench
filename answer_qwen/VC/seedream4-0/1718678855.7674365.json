      "question": "Is the capybara’s snout broad and flat with a rounded muzzle, consistent with its real-world anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara's snout is clearly visible. It appears broad and flat, with a rounded muzzle, which aligns with the known anatomical features of real capybaras. Capybaras are large rodents with distinctive facial structures characterized by wide, flat snouts and short, blunt muzzles that help them graze efficiently. The visual representation in this image accurately reflects these traits, even though the character is anthropomorphized with human-like posture and clothing. The muzzle shape is not exaggerated or distorted; it retains the natural proportions typical of capybaras. Therefore, based on both visual cues and biological knowledge, the snout is consistent with real-world anatomy.",

      "question": "Are the capybara’s ears small, rounded, and located high on the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara’s ears are visible beneath the top hat. They appear small and rounded, consistent with the natural ear structure of capybaras. In reality, capybaras have relatively small, rounded ears positioned high on the sides of their heads, which helps them detect sounds while remaining partially submerged in water. Although the ears are partially obscured by the hat, their shape and placement are still discernible and match the expected morphology. The positioning is consistent with real capybaras, as they do not have long or prominent ears like some other animals. Thus, the depiction aligns with biological accuracy.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara is depicted standing upright on two legs, which is an anthropomorphic trait not seen in real capybaras, who typically walk on all fours. However, within the context of this stylized, fictional representation, the animal is clearly standing vertically. Additionally, its body is oriented straight ahead, and its face is directly facing the viewer. This frontal orientation suggests direct engagement with the audience, typical of portrait-style compositions. While the posture is unnatural for a real capybara, the image presents it as standing upright and facing forward. Therefore, based on the visual evidence, the answer is yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara is holding a teacup and saucer with both hands. Both hands are clearly visible and positioned in front of the chest, each grasping part of the cup and saucer. The left hand supports the saucer, while the right hand holds the handle of the cup. This positioning is consistent with human-like dexterity and grip mechanics. The hands are proportionally scaled to the body and show fine motor control, which is part of the anthropomorphic design. Since both hands are indeed in front of the chest and engaged with an object, the statement is accurate based on the visual information.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara’s fur is predominantly light brown, especially on the cheeks and head. Around the muzzle area, the fur appears slightly darker, creating a subtle contrast that enhances facial definition. This coloration pattern is consistent with real capybaras, which typically have light to medium brown fur with slightly darker areas around the face, particularly near the nose and mouth. The shading in the image reflects natural pigmentation patterns observed in wild capybaras. Even though the animal is dressed in formal attire, the fur coloration remains biologically plausible. Thus, the description matches the visual evidence and real-world anatomy.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara’s body is depicted as large and robust, with a thick torso that is characteristic of its species. Although the legs are not fully visible due to the angle and clothing (a suit), the overall silhouette suggests a stocky build. Real capybaras are known for their heavyset bodies, short legs, and broad shoulders, which support their semi-aquatic lifestyle. The figure in the image maintains this general proportionality, even in anthropomorphic form. The suit drapes over a bulky frame, indicating a substantial torso. While the legs are obscured, the posture and body mass imply short limbs consistent with capybara anatomy. Therefore, the depiction aligns with the animal’s real-world physical traits.",

      "question": "Does the capybara have four limbs visible or implied by posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only the capybara’s front limbs (hands) are clearly visible, as they are used to hold the teacup. The hind limbs are not visible due to the angle and the way the character is dressed in a full-length suit. However, the posture—standing upright with a balanced stance—implies the presence of two hind legs supporting the body. In real capybaras, all four limbs are present, and although this image shows only two, the anthropomorphic rendering assumes a quadrupedal base adapted for bipedalism. Given that the animal is standing upright and stable, the existence of four limbs is logically implied by the posture and biomechanics, even if only two are shown. Thus, the answer is yes, as the limbs are either visible or implied.",
