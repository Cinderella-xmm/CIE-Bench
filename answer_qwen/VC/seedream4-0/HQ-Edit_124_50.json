      "question": "Is the central red rose with green leaves clearly visible on the horse's flank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is depicted under a glass dome, and its body features decorative floral patterns. The central area of the horse's flank displays a large red rose surrounded by green leaves, which is consistent with traditional Dala horse designs. Despite the presence of puzzle-like cracks across the horse's body, the central rose remains intact and visually distinct. The color contrast between the red rose and the surrounding blue and yellow floral motifs makes it stand out clearly. Therefore, based on visual analysis and knowledge of such folk art, the central red rose with green leaves is indeed clearly visible.",

      "question": "Is the black bridle visible along the horse's face and jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse in Image B has a painted facial structure that includes a black line running along the bridge of the nose and extending down the jawline, consistent with a bridle design commonly seen in traditional Swedish Dala horses. This black line is clearly defined and follows the contours of the horse’s face. Even though the horse appears fragmented with puzzle-piece effects, the bridle remains continuous and visible. Thus, combining visual cues with cultural knowledge of Dala horse craftsmanship, the black bridle is present and identifiable.",

      "question": "Is the dark tail extending from the rear of the horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the rear of the horse in Image B, a dark, solid-colored tail is visible, extending downward from the hindquarters. It contrasts sharply with the lighter wood tones of the legs and body. The tail is smooth and curved, typical of stylized wooden horse carvings. Although the horse is partially obscured by the glass dome and some puzzle fragmentation, the tail remains fully intact and distinguishable. This aligns with common representations of Dala horses, where the tail is often painted black or dark brown.",

      "question": "Are the horse's legs and facial area rendered in natural wood grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The legs and facial region of the horse in Image B exhibit a light, golden-brown hue with visible wood grain patterns, suggesting a natural wood finish. These areas lack the colorful floral decoration found on the body, which is typical for Dala horses—where the limbs and head are left in natural wood tone to emphasize craftsmanship. The texture appears consistent with carved wood, and the lighting enhances the grain details. This matches real-world examples of hand-carved wooden horses, confirming that these regions are rendered with natural wood grain.",

      "question": "Are red roses symmetrically placed on both flanks of the horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the horse’s flanks in Image B, there is a red rose on each side near the midsection. However, due to the puzzle-like fragmentation across the body, especially around the right flank (viewer’s left), the symmetry is disrupted. The left flank (viewer’s right) shows a complete rose, but the right flank’s rose is partially broken into puzzle pieces, altering its shape and placement. While the intent may have been symmetrical, the current state breaks this symmetry. Thus, based on visual inspection and understanding of symmetry, the roses are not symmetrically placed in their current form.",

      "question": "Is the scene illuminated with warm, golden light creating soft shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall ambiance of Image B is characterized by a warm, golden glow emanating from the lantern on the right and possibly from interior lighting within the cabin. This lighting casts soft shadows beneath the horse and around the glass dome, enhancing depth and texture. The warm tones dominate the scene, particularly on the wooden walls and the base of the display. This lighting style is consistent with cozy, rustic interiors, and the soft shadows suggest diffused illumination rather than harsh direct light. Therefore, the scene is indeed illuminated with warm, golden light producing soft shadows.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background reveals a wall constructed from horizontal wooden logs, typical of log cabins. Behind the horse, through the glass dome, a stone fireplace is visible, containing neatly stacked firewood. The mantel above the fireplace holds candles and decorative items, further reinforcing the rustic setting. These elements are consistent with traditional Scandinavian or alpine-style interiors. The visibility of both the logs and the fireplace confirms that these features are present in the background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse in Image B is shown in a side view, with its head turned to the right, indicating a profile orientation. Its body is aligned horizontally, and all features such as the mane, legs, and tail are consistent with a lateral stance. The direction of the head and the positioning of the ears confirm that it is facing right. This is standard for display purposes in decorative art, allowing full appreciation of the painted side. Therefore, based on visual alignment and anatomical cues, the horse is indeed positioned in profile, facing right.",
