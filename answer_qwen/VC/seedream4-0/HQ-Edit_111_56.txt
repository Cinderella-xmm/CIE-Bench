    "Question": "Q1: Are both feet positioned en pointe, with the right foot slightly ahead of the left?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is a marble statue of a classical female figure, likely representing a Greco-Roman deity or noblewoman. The statue is standing on a base, and its feet are visible from behind. Observing the positioning of the feet, the right foot appears to be slightly advanced compared to the left, and both feet are elevated on their toes, consistent with a 'en pointe' stance. However, this is not a real dancer but a sculpture, so the pose is stylized rather than anatomically functional. In classical statuary, such poses often mimic natural movement but are idealized. The right foot is indeed slightly forward, and both are balanced on the tips of the toes, which aligns with the description. Therefore, based on visual cues and knowledge of classical sculpture posing, the answer is yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are both arms extended laterally from the body, with palms facing inward and fingers gently curved?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arms of the statue are clearly visible from behind. They extend outward from the torso, reaching approximately shoulder level, and are angled slightly backward. The hands are open, with fingers gently curved, and the palms appear to face inward toward the body. This posture is typical of classical statues where the arms are posed in a relaxed, flowing manner to suggest grace and balance. The drapery of the garment also follows the arm contours, supporting the idea that the arms are extended laterally. Based on the visual evidence and common stylistic features of Greco-Roman sculpture, the description matches. Thus, the answer is yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the head turned to the left, with the chin slightly raised?",
    "explanation": "From the back view in Image B, the head of the statue is visible, showing a bun hairstyle adorned with a laurel wreath. The head is turned slightly to the left, as indicated by the angle of the neck and the placement of the hair and wreath. Additionally, the profile suggests that the chin is slightly raised, giving the figure an elegant, upward gaze. This is consistent with classical sculptural conventions where figures are often depicted with a dignified, poised head tilt. Although we cannot see the full facial expression, the alignment of the neck and head strongly indicates a leftward turn and a raised chin. Hence, the answer is yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the legs fully extended and aligned vertically, with the spine slightly arched backward?",
    "explanation": "Observing the lower half of the statue in Image B, the legs are straight and appear to be fully extended, supporting the weight of the figure. The alignment is vertical, especially given the rigid nature of stone sculptures. However, the spine does not show a pronounced arch backward; instead, it maintains a neutral, upright posture typical of classical statues aiming for balance and symmetry. While there may be a subtle curve due to the natural anatomy of the figure, it is not a noticeable backward arch. Classical statues often emphasize poise and stability, not exaggerated spinal curvature. Therefore, while the legs are fully extended and vertical, the spine is not significantly arched backward. The answer is no.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the arms positioned at approximately hip level, extending outward from the sides of the torso?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arms of the statue are visible from behind and extend outward from the torso. Their position is roughly at hip level, with the elbows slightly bent and hands open. The extension is lateral, meaning they project sideways from the body. This pose is consistent with classical representations of figures in motion or in contemplative stances. The drapery flows naturally from the arms, further suggesting that they are held out at about hip height. Given the visual evidence and typical proportions in ancient sculpture, the arms are indeed positioned at hip level and extend outward. Thus, the answer is yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the upper body slightly tilted forward while maintaining vertical alignment through the spine?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the upper body of the statue appears upright and balanced. There is no significant forward tilt; instead, the torso maintains a vertical alignment, supported by the straight spine and symmetrical drapery. The shoulders are level, and the head is held high, indicating a neutral posture. Classical statues often emphasize symmetry and balance, avoiding forward leans unless depicting dynamic action. Here, the figure stands in a composed, static pose, with no indication of forward tilt. Therefore, while the spine remains vertical, the upper body is not tilted forward. The answer is no.",
    "answer": "No"
