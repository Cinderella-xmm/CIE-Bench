      "question": "Are the eyes of the figurine dark brown in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine's eyes are clearly visible and appear to be a deep, rich brown color. This observation is consistent with typical artistic representations of poodles or anthropomorphic animals in formal attire, where realistic or slightly stylized features are used. The shading and reflection in the eyes suggest depth and realism, aligning with dark brown as a plausible eye color for such a character. Based on visual cues, there is no indication of any other color like blue or green, confirming that the eyes are indeed dark brown.",

      "question": "Is the nose of the figurine black and oval-shaped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the figurine’s nose is distinctly black, which is typical for many poodle breeds. Its shape is rounded and elongated, fitting an oval description rather than a round or pointed one. This oval form is consistent with anatomical proportions of a poodle’s muzzle when stylized in a portrait-like manner. The contrast between the black nose and the white fur further emphasizes its shape, supporting the conclusion that it is both black and oval-shaped.",

      "question": "Does the figurine retain the white, curly fur in a poodle-style grooming pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figurine with a meticulously groomed head of white fur styled into a classic poodle cut. The fur is voluminous, curly, and arranged symmetrically around the face, resembling the traditional 'pom-pom' style often seen in show poodles. This grooming pattern is characteristic of high-maintenance poodle styling and is preserved here in a stylized yet recognizable form. The curls are well-defined and maintain their structure, indicating intentional design to reflect a poodle’s signature look.",

      "question": "Are there large, layered pink ruffles on both sides of the figurine’s dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress features prominent decorative elements on both shoulders. These consist of multiple layers of soft, translucent pink fabric arranged in ruffled clusters. They are symmetrical and extend outward from the upper arms, forming a dramatic, ornate effect typical of Rococo or Baroque-inspired fashion. The texture and volume suggest they are made of tulle or organza, commonly used for such embellishments. Both sides display identical ruffle structures, confirming their presence on both sides.",

      "question": "Is there a detailed silver brooch located at the center of the chest area of the dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the front of the dress in Image B, there is a central decorative element positioned directly over the chest. It appears to be a metallic, intricately designed brooch with floral or lace-like patterns, possibly embedded with small gemstones or reflective details. Its placement and craftsmanship suggest it serves as a focal point of the garment. The material has a silvery sheen, consistent with silver or silver-toned metal, and it is clearly distinct from the surrounding fabric, confirming its identity as a detailed brooch.",

      "question": "Is the figurine in a side profile pose with the head turned slightly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B is positioned facing mostly to the right, showing a clear side profile view of its body and face. However, the head is angled slightly toward the viewer, giving a three-quarter view rather than a full side profile. This subtle turn allows visibility of both the facial features and the contours of the ear and neck. While not fully frontal, the orientation indicates a slight forward tilt of the head, distinguishing it from a rigid side profile.",

      "question": "Does the dress maintain a pastel color scheme with light blue and pink hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B incorporates a delicate palette dominated by soft, muted tones. The main body of the gown features light blue fabric with intricate lace detailing, while the ruffles, sleeves, and trim are rendered in pale pink. These colors are harmoniously blended, creating a gentle, romantic aesthetic typical of pastel schemes. The combination of light blue and pink is consistent throughout the garment, reinforcing the overall pastel theme. This choice aligns with historical fashion styles such as those from the 18th-century French court, known for their use of soft, elegant colors.",
