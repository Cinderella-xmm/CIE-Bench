      "question": "Does the image retain the visible cheese texture and layered shape of the chicken parmesan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chicken parmesan is clearly visible on the right side of the plate. The melted cheese appears smooth and evenly spread over a red sauce base, which is consistent with typical chicken parmesan preparation. While the cheese has a slightly glossy surface suggesting it's been baked or heated, the texture appears somewhat uniform without distinct separation into layers or visible stringiness that might indicate a more textured melt. However, the overall layered structure—sauce, cheese, and presumably breaded chicken underneath—is preserved, even if not highly detailed. Based on common knowledge of how chicken parmesan is served, especially in school lunches, the dish retains its expected form despite slight simplification in texture depiction.",

      "question": "Is the salad presented with discernible leafy green textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The salad in Image B consists of chopped lettuce and other greens, including what appears to be diced cucumber and possibly sunflower seeds. The individual leaves are distinguishable, with visible veins and edges characteristic of romaine or similar lettuce varieties. The lighting enhances the green coloration and slight moisture on the leaves, contributing to a realistic appearance of freshness. This level of detail allows for clear identification of leafy textures, consistent with typical presentation in balanced meal imagery. Therefore, based on visual cues and world knowledge about salad composition, the textures are indeed discernible.",

      "question": "Is the milk carton still placed behind the salad?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skim milk carton is positioned at the top center of the plate, directly above the salad portion. It is angled slightly toward the viewer, with its front label facing forward. The salad lies below and to the left of the carton, indicating that the carton is placed behind the salad from the viewer’s perspective. This placement is consistent with standard food photography where beverage containers are often arranged near the edge of the plate but not overlapping main components. Comparing this to typical lunch presentations, this positioning is logical and maintains spatial clarity. Thus, the milk carton remains behind the salad.",

      "question": "Are the semi-circular orange slices with visible internal segments retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The two orange slices in Image B are cut into semi-circular shapes and placed side by side near the bottom of the plate. Each slice shows a clear division into internal segments, with visible pulp and membranes separating them. The bright orange color and moist surface suggest freshness. These features align with how oranges are typically sliced and presented in meals, particularly in school lunch settings. The segmentation is clearly visible, confirming retention of both shape and internal structure. No signs of blurring or distortion affect these details.",

      "question": "Does the image retain the white plate against the orange tablecloth background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a white oval plate as the central element, resting on a solid orange background that resembles a tablecloth. The contrast between the white plate and the vibrant orange backdrop is strong and visually consistent. The edges of the plate are clean and well-defined, and the background is uniformly colored without any pattern or variation, supporting the interpretation of a simple orange tablecloth. This setup is typical in promotional or educational food imagery to highlight the meal. Given that the original image (A) also had this configuration, and no changes have been made to the plate or background in Image B, the composition remains unchanged.",
