    "Question": "Q1: Are the orange vertical support beams still present along the edges of the hotel building?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hotel building is depicted within a transparent glass enclosure resembling a terrarium. Despite the surreal framing, the architectural features of the building remain consistent with the original design. The orange vertical support beams are clearly visible along the edges of the structure, maintaining their distinctive appearance. These beams are structural elements that run from the ground to the top of the building and are identifiable by their bright orange color and regular spacing. Their presence is preserved even though the scene has been stylized into a miniature diorama.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the lower part of the hotel building still painted in light blue?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lower portion of the hotel building retains its light blue paint, which is consistent with the original design seen in Image A. This coloration is visible on the facade below the upper floors and around the ground-level columns. Even though the entire scene is now enclosed in a glass case and surrounded by artificial landscaping, the color scheme of the building remains unchanged. The light blue hue is a defining feature of the hotel’s exterior and is preserved in this edited version.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the white columns supporting the ground floor of the hotel still visible?",

They are positioned at regular intervals along the base of the building, just as they were in the original image. Although the scene has been transformed into a miniature diorama with added elements like sand, rocks, and palm trees, the structural integrity and visibility of these columns have not been compromised. Their placement and color remain consistent with the original design.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the swimming pool still kidney-shaped in outline?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the swimming pool appears to maintain its kidney-shaped outline, despite being scaled down and placed inside a glass enclosure. The curved edges and asymmetrical form characteristic of a kidney-shaped pool are still evident. The shape is preserved in the diorama representation, indicating that the editing process retained the original geometric design of the pool. This shape is a common feature in resort pools and is recognizable even when rendered in a stylized or miniature format.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are the blue sun loungers still arranged around the perimeter of the pool?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, blue sun loungers are indeed still arranged around the perimeter of the pool. They are visible both on the left and right sides of the pool within the glass enclosure. Although the number may be reduced due to the scale of the diorama, their arrangement and color remain consistent with the original setup. The loungers are positioned facing the pool, maintaining their functional layout for relaxation. The editing process has preserved this key element of the poolside environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the green-and-white striped umbrellas still visible near the poolside?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no green-and-white striped umbrellas visible near the poolside. While the scene includes various decorative elements such as palm trees, rocks, and toys, the specific umbrellas seen in the original image (Image A) are absent. Instead, the area appears to have been simplified or reimagined with different aesthetic choices. The absence of these umbrellas suggests that they were either removed during the editing process or replaced with other elements to fit the miniature theme.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q7: Are there still people visible sunbathing on loungers or swimming in the pool?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are still people visible in the scene—some sunbathing on loungers and others swimming in the pool. However, they appear significantly smaller and more stylized due to the diorama format. The figures are proportionally scaled down but retain human-like forms and postures typical of a resort setting. Their presence confirms that the social and recreational aspects of the original scene have been preserved, albeit in a more whimsical, toy-like representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the swimming pool still positioned directly in front of the hotel building?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the swimming pool is still positioned directly in front of the hotel building, maintaining the spatial relationship seen in the original image. The pool is centered and aligned with the building's facade, creating a clear visual connection between the two structures. Even though the entire scene is now contained within a glass case, the relative positioning of the pool and the hotel has not changed. This alignment supports the idea that the diorama is a faithful, albeit artistic, representation of the original layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
