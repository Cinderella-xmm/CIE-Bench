    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the dagger now rendered as a soft, plush toy rather than a rigid weapon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B appears to have a soft texture and lacks the sharpness and rigidity typically associated with metal weapons. The edges are rounded, and the overall appearance suggests it is made of fabric or plush material rather than metal. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues such as the lack of reflective surfaces and the visible stitching.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blade made of soft, silver-gray fabric with black embroidered patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blade in Image B has a silver-gray color and features black embroidered patterns that resemble traditional designs. The texture and appearance suggest it is made of fabric, which aligns with the characteristics of a plush toy. The analysis is based on the visible stitching and the matte finish, which are typical for soft materials.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hilt made of a soft, faux ivory-like fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hilt in Image B appears to be made of a soft material that mimics the look of ivory. It has a smooth texture and a creamy color, consistent with faux ivory-like fabric used in plush toys. The conclusion is based on the absence of hard edges and the uniformity of the surface, which are indicative of soft materials.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all edges of the plush dagger, including the hilt and blade, appear rounded and smooth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All edges of the object in Image B, including the hilt and blade, appear rounded and smooth. There are no sharp or angular lines that would suggest a rigid structure. This observation is supported by the visible stitching and the overall soft appearance of the object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the plush dagger appear stuffed and voluminous, with softened contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B appears stuffed and voluminous, with softened contours that give it a plush-like quality. The way it lies flat and the visible padding suggest it is filled with soft material, enhancing its toy-like appearance. This assessment is based on the object's shape and the way it conforms to the surface it rests on.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the plush dagger placed against a solid-colored backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a solid red color, providing a stark contrast to the white and gray tones of the plush dagger. This choice of backdrop helps highlight the object without any distractions, making it clear that the focus is solely on the plush dagger.",
