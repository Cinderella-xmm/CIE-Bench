      "question": "Is the shoe now rendered as a carved wooden sculpture rather than a fabric and rubber athletic shoe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shoe in Image B appears to be made of wood, with visible wood grain patterns and a carved texture. This is evident from the natural brown tones and the way light reflects off the surface, which is characteristic of wooden sculptures rather than fabric and rubber materials. The overall structure mimics an athletic shoe but with a material transformation.",

      "question": "Are the panel shapes, lace paths, and branding details represented with deep grooves and visible wood grain patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the panel shapes, lace paths, and branding details are indeed represented with deep grooves and visible wood grain patterns. The intricate carving follows the original design lines of an athletic shoe, but the material change to wood necessitates these features being carved into the surface, creating a textured appearance that aligns with artistic woodworking practices.",

      "question": "Does the sculpture use a combination of dark and light wood tones to represent the original black and gray coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a combination of dark and light wood tones used throughout the shoe's design. These variations in tone effectively represent the original black and gray coloration found on athletic shoes. The use of different wood shades helps to differentiate between various parts of the shoe, such as panels and overlays, enhancing the visual depth and detail.",
