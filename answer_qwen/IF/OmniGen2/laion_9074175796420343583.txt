    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "The pie in Image B does not have human-like features such as a face or limbs. It is depicted as a typical lattice-crust pie with no anthropomorphic characteristics. The analysis is based on the visual cues of the pie's appearance, which aligns with common representations of pies in illustrations.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "The knife in Image B has not been altered to resemble a feather pen. It maintains its original form as a standard kitchen knife with a wooden handle. There is no indication that it is being held by the pie character; it simply rests on the pie. This conclusion is drawn from observing the knife's design and position relative to the pie.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "The lattice crust pattern on the pie in Image B is part of the pie's structure and not depicted as an apron draped over a lower half. The pattern is consistent with typical lattice designs used for pies, serving both decorative and functional purposes in baking. This analysis is based on understanding the purpose and appearance of lattice crusts in pies.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:"
    "explanation": "Scene 1 in Image B displays the text “Hush! Respect the quiet crust.” However, there are no other pastry characters appearing to chatter. The scene focuses solely on the pie and the knife, without additional characters. This conclusion is reached by examining the content and elements present in Scene 1.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:"
    "explanation": "Scene 2 in Image B contains the text “You’ll get a slice of silence!” but does not show the feather pen positioned above the pie in a stern, hovering manner. The knife remains resting on the pie as in Scene 1, and there is no transformation into a feather pen. This analysis is based on the visual elements and text present in Scene 2.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:"
    "explanation": "Image B is composed as a two-panel comic strip with distinct scene divisions. Each panel contains a separate scene with the same pie and knife but different text, indicating a sequence of events. This structure is characteristic of comic strips, where panels are used to convey a narrative progression.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7:"
    "explanation": "The artwork in Image B is rendered in a cartoonish, illustrative style rather than photorealistic. This is evident from the simplified shapes, bold outlines, and flat colors used to depict the pie, knife, and background. Such stylistic choices are typical of illustrations designed for clarity and visual appeal in comics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
