    "Question": "Q1: Has the lifeguard tower and yellow rescue vehicle been simplified into a minimalist safety icon?",
    "explanation": "Image B is completely white with no discernible objects, icons, or features. There are no visual cues of a lifeguard tower, a yellow rescue vehicle, or any form of minimalist safety icon. The absence of any elements makes it impossible to identify or analyze such objects.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are distinct color blocks and clean edges present in the design?",
    "explanation": "Since Image B is entirely white without any variations in color or edges, there are no distinct color blocks or clean edges to analyze. The uniformity of the image suggests an absence of design elements that would typically be associated with color blocks and edges.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the icon set against a white background?",
    "explanation": "Image B is uniformly white throughout, indicating that there is no separate icon or background to distinguish. Therefore, it cannot be said that an icon is set against a white background as there is no icon present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the icon's style match that of airport signage icons?",
    "explanation": "Given that Image B lacks any identifiable icon or design, it is not possible to compare its style to that of airport signage icons. Airport signage typically includes clear symbols and text on contrasting backgrounds, which are absent here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the design suitable for integration into emergency information systems?",
    "explanation": "The complete lack of content in Image B means it does not convey any information or instructions that would be useful in an emergency context. Emergency information systems require clear, recognizable symbols or text, none of which are present in this image.",
    "answer": "No"
