      "question": "Does the character retain the original shell structure and turtle attributes, reimagined in a cute, chibi-style design with long legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is a turtle with a shell that retains the segmented structure typical of turtles. However, the design is stylized in a cute, chibi manner with exaggerated features like large eyes and a small body. The legs are proportionally longer than what would be expected on a real turtle, fitting the chibi aesthetic. This analysis combines visual cues from the image with knowledge of chibi art styles and turtle anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the character dressed in stylish designer clothing, wearing small glasses on the head, and carrying a sketchbook or tablet secured behind the shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is dressed in a stylish outfit consisting of a jacket, scarf, and pants, which can be considered designer clothing due to their neat and coordinated appearance. Small glasses are perched on the head, adding to the character's chic look. A sketchbook or tablet is indeed secured behind the shell, as indicated by its visible straps and placement. This conclusion is drawn from observing the character's attire and accessories in the image.",

      "question": "Does the character have tiny, chic accessories like a scarf or a small designer bag to complement the look?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B has a scarf around its neck, which serves as a chic accessory complementing the overall look. There is no visible small designer bag in the image. However, since the question asks if there are any tiny, chic accessories and the scarf fits this description, the answer is affirmative based on the presence of the scarf alone.",

      "question": "Is the background a solid color that harmonizes with the character’s overall color scheme, with no gradients or textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a solid orange color without any gradients or textures. This choice of background harmonizes with the character’s warm color scheme, including the orange scarf and brown tones in the clothing. The reasoning here involves observing the uniformity and color of the background and relating it to the character's colors.",

      "question": "Does the image have an aspect ratio of 9:16, with \"OOTD\" as top text, the full-body character on the left, and individual clothing pieces/accessories on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has an aspect ratio that appears to be 9:16, which is common for vertical social media posts. The text 'OOTD' is present at the top, indicating 'Outfit of the Day'. On the left side, there is a full-body view of the character, while on the right, individual clothing pieces and accessories are displayed separately. This layout and content match the described format perfectly.",
