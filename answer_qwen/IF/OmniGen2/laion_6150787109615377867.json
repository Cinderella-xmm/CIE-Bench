      "question": "Has the tabletop been replaced with a gear-shaped component featuring visible teeth and intricate engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop is clearly not gear-shaped. It has a circular design with ornate engravings that resemble a sunburst pattern, which is typical of decorative elements in steampunk aesthetics. There are no visible teeth or gear-like features on the top surface. The analysis is based on observing the shape and patterns present on the tabletop.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the table legs been morphed into articulated, piston-driven limbs with visible joints and brass or copper-colored accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The table legs in Image B have indeed been transformed into complex structures resembling mechanical limbs. These limbs feature visible joints and components that suggest articulation, such as pistons and gears. The coloration is consistent with brass or copper tones, adding to the steampunk aesthetic. This conclusion is drawn from analyzing the structure and appearance of the legs.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible steam vents placed along the central column of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the central column of the table in Image B, there are no distinct features that resemble steam vents. The column contains various dials and gauges but lacks any clear vent structures. The reasoning is based on identifying specific mechanical features typically associated with steam vents.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the base feature intricate cog patterns and at least one rotating dial or gauge element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the table in Image B does exhibit intricate designs that include cog patterns, which are characteristic of steampunk machinery. Additionally, there are multiple dials and gauge elements integrated into the base, suggesting functionality and complexity. This conclusion is reached by observing the detailed patterns and mechanical components present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the metal table been transformed into a coherent, steampunk-style mechanized creature with integrated mechanical features resembling a living machine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a table that has been reimagined with numerous mechanical and ornamental features typical of steampunk design. The integration of gears, dials, and articulated limbs gives it an appearance of a mechanized entity. Comparing this to common characteristics of steampunk art, the table can be considered a coherent mechanized creature. The transformation from a simple metal table (as seen in Image A) to this complex design supports this conclusion.",
