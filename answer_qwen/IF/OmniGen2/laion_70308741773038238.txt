    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object is clearly not a Bentley car but rather a yacht-themed bottle. The visual cues such as the shape of the object, its placement on glass bases, and the wave patterns indicate it is designed to resemble a fragrance packaging with nautical themes. There are no elements resembling a car's structure or design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The body of the object in Image B is indeed elongated and streamlined, similar to a vessel or bottle. This conclusion is drawn from the smooth curves and the overall shape that lacks the angularity typical of a vehicle. Comparing this to Image A, which shows a car with distinct automotive features like wheels and windows, the transformation is evident.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The object in Image B rests on textured glass bases instead of wheels. These bases are buoyant in appearance and serve as supports for the bottle-like structure. In contrast, Image A displays a car with traditional wheels, confirming the replacement in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "Image B features a silver cap on top of the transformed object, which includes nautical design elements such as radar equipment typically found on yachts. This is not present in Image A, where the top of the car has no such cap or nautical features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "There are embossed letters along the sides of the object in Image B, using an elegant serif typography that could represent branding. However, these do not specifically represent Bentley branding as they appear more aligned with a nautical theme. Image A does not have such lettering on the car.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:",
    "explanation": "Flowing sea wave patterns are visible across the surface of the object in Image B, enhancing the nautical theme. These patterns are artistic and thematic, not functional. Image A does not feature any such patterns on the car, further highlighting the transformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
