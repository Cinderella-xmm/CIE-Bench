    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "The gullwing doors in Image B do not look like shoulder buttons on a gaming controller. Gullwing doors are hinged at the roof and open upwards, which is a distinctive feature of certain luxury sports cars. Shoulder buttons on a gaming controller are small, flat, and located on the top edges of the controller, which does not match the appearance or function of the car's doors.",

    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "The front grille in Image B has not been transformed into a directional pad (D-pad) control layout.
