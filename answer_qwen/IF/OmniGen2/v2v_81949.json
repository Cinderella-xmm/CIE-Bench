      "question": "Does the edited image feature bold outlines and dramatic halftone shading on the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a character with bold black outlines that sharply define the figure against the background. The shading on the character is not halftone but rather solid black and white, which creates a high-contrast effect typical of graphic design styles aiming for a bold visual impact. Halftone shading would involve small dots to create gradients, which are not present here.",

      "question": "Is there a grimy cityscape included in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the edited image includes a cityscape depicted in a stylized manner with buildings silhouetted against the sky. These buildings have a gritty appearance, consistent with the overall graphic style of the image, suggesting an urban environment that aligns with the theme of cleaning 'the city's lungs.'",

      "question": "Has the yellow circle been incorporated as a dramatic background element in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The yellow circle in the edited image serves as a central background element, framing the character and the chimney. It draws attention to these elements by creating a strong contrast with the surrounding darker tones and the black outlines of the character and objects.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of the edited image, there is indeed a caption that reads 'Just another day cleaning the city's lungs.' This text complements the visual elements by providing context and reinforcing the message about urban cleanliness associated with the character's activity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the character is positioned beside a brick chimney, holding a cleaning tool over his shoulder. However, the character does not appear to be surveying the cityscape; instead, he seems to be portrayed in a static pose focused on the task at hand, which is implied by the tools and the caption.",
