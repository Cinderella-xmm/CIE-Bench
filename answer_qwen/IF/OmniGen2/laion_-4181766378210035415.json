        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bed frame and base appear to be made of a solid material resembling typical furniture construction rather than LEGO bricks. The mattress also does not exhibit any characteristics of being constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks. The visual cues suggest that only the bedding is replaced with LEGO bricks.",
