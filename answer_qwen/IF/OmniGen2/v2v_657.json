      "question": "Is the individual depicted within a Funko Pop figure box in an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The individual within the Funko Pop figure box is depicted in a frontal perspective, not an isometric one.
