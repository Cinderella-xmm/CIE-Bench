        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the robe of the kneeling figure rendered with intricate golden patterns and a shimmering, metallic texture consistent with gilded brocade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robe of the kneeling figure is indeed rendered with intricate golden patterns and a shimmering texture that resembles gilded brocade.

      "question": "Does the cloak of the standing figure exhibit deep, soft folds with a dark, velvety texture and subtle light absorption consistent with velvet material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cloak of the standing figure does exhibit deep folds and a dark color, but it does not appear to have a velvety texture or subtle light absorption.

      "question": "Is the infant wrapped in a silver-colored cloth featuring detailed ornamentation such as embossed patterns or filigree, consistent with ornate silver swaddling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The infant is wrapped in a cloth that appears silver-colored and features detailed ornamentation. However, the cloth does not show embossed patterns or filigree; instead, it has a smooth, reflective quality that suggests a simpler form of ornate swaddling. While it is decorative, it does not fully match the description of elaborate silver swaddling.",
