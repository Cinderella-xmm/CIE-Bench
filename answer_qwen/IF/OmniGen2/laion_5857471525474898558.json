      "question": "Is the building's facade composed of visible, blocky LEGO-like bricks forming the overall structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The building in Image B clearly displays a facade made up of large, blocky bricks that resemble LEGO pieces. These bricks are uniform in size and shape, forming the entire structure of the building. The visual cues, such as the distinct edges and repetitive pattern, align with the appearance of LEGO bricks rather than traditional construction materials.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the buildingâ€™s bricks rendered in muted red tones and the window frames in muted blue tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building's bricks are not rendered in muted red tones; instead, they are bright orange, which is a common color for LEGO bricks. Additionally, the window frames do not appear to be in muted blue tones but rather in a standard grayish color typical of LEGO windows. This analysis is based on the vivid colors and the style consistent with LEGO designs.",

      "question": "Have the climbing plants been replaced with green, segmented LEGO-style vines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows climbing plants replaced with green, segmented structures that mimic the look of LEGO vines. These segments are uniformly shaped and spaced, resembling LEGO-style elements rather than natural plant growth. The visual cues suggest an intentional design choice to maintain the LEGO aesthetic throughout the image.",

      "question": "Do all balconies feature gray, blocky LEGO-style railings instead of realistic metal or decorative designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All balconies in Image B feature railings that are gray and have a blocky, LEGO-style appearance. They lack the intricate details or realistic textures typically seen in metal or decorative railings. Instead, they follow the simplified, geometric design characteristic of LEGO constructions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO building situated on a flat, simple platform that contrasts with the surrounding environment to highlight its blocky aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO building in Image B is indeed situated on a flat, simple platform. This platform serves as a base that contrasts sharply with the detailed LEGO structure above it, emphasizing the blocky aesthetic of the building. The simplicity of the platform ensures that the focus remains on the LEGO construction.",
