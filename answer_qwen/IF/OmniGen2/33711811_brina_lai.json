      "question": "Are the snowy mountain peaks visibly reshaped into jagged, wing-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain peaks retain their natural rugged and snow-covered appearance. There are no visual cues suggesting that they have been reshaped into wing-like structures. The peaks appear consistent with typical mountain formations, showing no signs of artificial or fantastical modifications.",

      "question": "Does the foreground lake display a pattern of reflective, scale-like textures across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lake in Image B appears calm with some reflections from the sky and surrounding landscape. However, there is no evidence of scale-like textures on its surface. The water's surface looks smooth and natural, without any unusual patterns that would suggest scales.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The peninsula in Image B maintains its natural shape as a landmass extending into the water. It does not exhibit characteristics of a sinewy tail structure. Its form remains consistent with typical geographical features, lacking any artificial or mythical elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The houses in Image B remain distinct and separate structures. They do not form a continuous spine-like structure. Their appearance is consistent with residential buildings, showing no signs of being reconfigured into a metallic or segmented form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B contains scattered clouds, but none of them have the distinct swirling pattern or shape that would resemble eyes. The clouds appear natural and random, without any specific resemblance to facial features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grassland in Image B displays a uniform texture typical of natural vegetation. There are no directional or windswept patterns that resemble fur. The area looks like an ordinary grassland without any mythical or animalistic characteristics.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all modified elements (wings, scales, tail, spine, eyes, fur) integrate seamlessly into a single, coherent mythical beast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since none of the individual elements in Image B have been modified to resemble wings, scales, a tail, a spine, eyes, or fur, it follows that these elements do not integrate into a mythical beast. The image retains its natural landscape features without any mythical transformations.",
