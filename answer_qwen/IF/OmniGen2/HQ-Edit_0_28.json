      "question": "Has the overall scene been resized and framed vertically to resemble a bookmark format?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image in question has been formatted with a vertical orientation, typical of a bookmark. The edges are clean and straight, suggesting it has been cropped or resized from a larger image. The addition of decorative elements at the corners further supports this, as they are common in bookmark designs. This analysis is based on the visual cues of the image's shape and layout.",

      "question": "Does the man's robe feature abstract geometric patterns rendered in muted earth tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robe worn by the man in the image displays a pattern that appears to be composed of various shapes and lines, which can be interpreted as abstract geometric patterns. The colors used are indeed muted and fall within the earth tone palette, such as browns and tans. This conclusion is drawn from observing the texture and color scheme of the robe.",

      "question": "Have the lamps been transformed into decorative corner flourishes with intricate design elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible lamps as seen in Image A. Instead, the corners of the image contain ornate, decorative elements that resemble flourishes. These elements have an intricate design, consistent with what one might expect from artistic embellishments rather than functional objects like lamps. The comparison between the two images confirms the transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bookcase extended into a textured background that includes subtle script elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a bookcase; instead, it features a textured background with what appears to be faint script elements. This suggests that the original bookcase has been stylized or replaced with a design that incorporates textural and scriptural details. Comparing with Image A, where a detailed bookcase is present, reinforces this observation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there clearly defined blank spaces or margins in the image suitable for placing inspirational quotes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image contains areas around the central figure that appear unoccupied by any significant content, creating blank spaces or margins. These spaces are evenly distributed and could serve as ideal locations for adding text such as inspirational quotes. The presence of these margins is evident when considering the overall layout and design of the image.",
