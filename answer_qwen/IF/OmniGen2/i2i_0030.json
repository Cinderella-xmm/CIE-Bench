      "question": "Is the original fruit platter photo used as the centerpiece without significant alterations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fruit platter appears to be the central visual element on the packaging. The arrangement and types of fruits (such as kiwi slices, watermelon wedges, orange segments, etc.) are recognizable and consistent with a typical fruit platter presentation. There are no visible signs of major distortions or changes in the fruit layout that would suggest significant alterations. Therefore, it seems the original fruit platter has been used as is.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are indeed green leaf graphics surrounding the fruit platter on the packaging. These leaves are stylized and appear to be digitally added for decorative purposes, enhancing the natural and fresh appeal of the product. This addition is not present in Image A, which only shows the fruit platter itself.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B transitions smoothly from a lighter shade at the top to a slightly darker shade at the bottom, creating a gradient effect. The color palette is predominantly light green, which complements the theme of freshness and health associated with the product. This gradient style is distinct and noticeable against the white background of Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B with Image A, the fruit platter in Image B retains the same variety and arrangement of fruits, with similar colors and textures. However, the lighting and slight enhancements in Image B might make the colors appear more vibrant, but these changes do not significantly alter the overall appearance. Thus, the details and colors are largely preserved.",
