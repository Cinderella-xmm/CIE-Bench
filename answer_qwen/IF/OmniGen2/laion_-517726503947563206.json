      "question": "Has the entire cruise ship been replaced with translucent, iridescent crystal structures that resemble a palace?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in question is no longer a traditional cruise ship but has been transformed into a structure composed of translucent and iridescent crystals. The shape and design are reminiscent of a palace with spires and arches, which is not characteristic of a typical cruise ship. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues of the crystalline appearance and architectural elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the hull been replaced with clear, angular, and faceted crystal structures rather than a smooth, solid form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hull in Image B is clearly depicted as a series of clear, angular, and faceted crystal structures. It lacks the smooth, solid form typical of a ship's hull. The facets reflect light, giving it a crystalline appearance. Comparing this to Image A, where the hull is smooth and solid, confirms the transformation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all windows been transformed into multifaceted gem-like elements with visible facets and reflective properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what would be the windows on a normal ship have been replaced by multifaceted gem-like elements. These elements exhibit visible facets and reflective properties, consistent with crystal or gemstone characteristics. In contrast, Image A shows standard windows on the ship, confirming the transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the decks been replaced with intricate, transparent crystal pathways featuring detailed patterns or latticework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the decks as intricate, transparent crystal pathways with detailed patterns or latticework. This is evident from the visible crystalline structures forming the pathways. In Image A, the decks are solid and lack such intricate designs, highlighting the difference.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the background been simplified to a minimalist horizon with no visible islands or complex terrain, emphasizing the crystal ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B still includes visible islands and complex terrain, similar to Image A. There is no significant simplification to a minimalist horizon. Therefore, the background does not emphasize the crystal ship through minimalism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there strong visual contrast between the shimmering, iridescent crystal ship and the minimalist background, enhancing the perception of brilliance and transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the ship in Image B is indeed shimmering and iridescent, the background is not minimalist as it retains features like islands and terrain. Thus, the contrast is not solely due to a minimalist background but rather the inherent properties of the crystal ship itself.",
