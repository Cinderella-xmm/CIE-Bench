      "question": "Is the armored figure visibly smaller in scale compared to its original form, consistent with being a miniature sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armored figure in Image B appears to be a miniature sculpture due to its placement within a transparent dome and the surrounding small-scale elements like cogwheels and brass filigree orbs. The size relative to these objects suggests it is smaller than a life-sized figure, which aligns with the characteristics of a miniature.",
