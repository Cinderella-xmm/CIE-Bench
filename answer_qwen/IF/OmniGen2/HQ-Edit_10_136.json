      "question": "Is the girl depicted in a cartoonized style with exaggerated features and an enlarged strumming hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The girl in Image B appears to have a smooth, stylized appearance with soft edges and uniform colors, which are characteristic of cartoonization. Her hand holding the guitar does not seem disproportionately large compared to her body, but it has a simplified, clean design typical of cartoon art. The overall style is consistent with digital illustration rather than realistic depiction.",

      "question": "Are the wall posters enhanced with vibrant band logos rendered in a watercolor style, showing visible brushwork and color diffusion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall posters in Image B feature bright, bold colors and clear, defined shapes that resemble band logos. However, there is no visible brushwork or color diffusion that would suggest a watercolor style. Instead, the logos appear digitally rendered with sharp lines and solid fills.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no cat silhouette present on the bed in Image B. The bed contains pillows and a blanket, but no additional elements like a cat silhouette are visible. This conclusion is based solely on the visual content of Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a small decorative box placed on the bed near the girl's feet. It has an ornate design and a label, suggesting it could be used for writing or storing small items. There is no bedside table in the image, so the box is directly on the bed.",
