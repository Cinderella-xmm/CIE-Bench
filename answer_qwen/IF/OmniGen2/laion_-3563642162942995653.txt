    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck's body exhibits a highly reflective and layered appearance with facets that resemble those of emerald or jade. The visual cues suggest a crystalline structure due to the sharp edges and the way light is reflected and refracted across the surface. This analysis is based on the observation of the truck's surfaces which display characteristics typical of cut gemstones.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "The wheels in Image B are transparent and exhibit internal patterns consistent with quartz crystal. The transparency and the visible crystalline structures within the wheels support this conclusion. The design mimics natural quartz formations, enhancing the perception of the wheels being made from such material.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "Image B shows the truck placed on a smooth, white platform that has the appearance of marble. The platform's polished surface and clean lines are characteristic of marble, providing a stark contrast to the green crystal truck above it.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:"
    "explanation": "The cabin and body surfaces in Image B feature angular, faceted planes that reflect and refract light in a manner similar to cut crystals. These surfaces have been designed to mimic the look of faceted gemstones, creating a sparkling effect under light.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:"
    "explanation": "Despite the transformation into a crystal form, the truck in Image B retains the structural proportions and layout of a military truck as seen in Image A. The overall shape, including the cabin size, wheel placement, and cargo area dimensions, remains consistent with the original vehicle's design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
