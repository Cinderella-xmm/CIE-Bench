      "question": "Is the entire ceramic form now constructed from interlocking puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears to be a sculpture with parts that resemble puzzle pieces. The visible sections of the sculpture show distinct edges and shapes typical of jigsaw puzzles, suggesting it is composed of interlocking pieces. This conclusion is drawn by observing the geometric shapes and how they fit together, which aligns with common characteristics of puzzle pieces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the puzzle pieces primarily beige and brown in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The puzzle pieces in Image B are predominantly beige and brown, matching the original color scheme of the ceramic sculpture. These colors are consistent with the natural tones often used in both ceramics and puzzle designs, reinforcing the idea that the sculpture has been reimagined as a puzzle while maintaining its original aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the puzzle piece edges aligned smoothly to create a continuous surface without visible gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the edges of the puzzle pieces do not appear to align smoothly. There are noticeable gaps and uneven surfaces where the pieces meet, indicating that the alignment is not perfect. This observation is based on the visual inspection of the seams between the pieces, which show irregularities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the conical top been replaced with a smooth green puzzle fragment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top part of the sculpture indeed features a green section that resembles a puzzle piece. This green fragment appears smooth and contrasts with the rest of the beige and brown pieces, suggesting it has replaced the original conical top. Comparing this with Image A, where the top was more rounded and less defined, supports this conclusion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sculpture positioned horizontally on a plain white shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the sculpture lying horizontally on what appears to be a plain white shelf. The background is minimalistic, focusing attention on the sculpture, and the shelf provides a clean, uncluttered surface that enhances the visibility of the object's details.",
