    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate a strong presence of brushstrokes throughout the image. The texture is evident in the sofa, wall, and other objects, suggesting an artistic rendering that mimics painted surfaces. This style is reminiscent of impressionistic techniques where brushstrokes are left visible to convey movement and emotion. By combining this observation with common knowledge about painting styles, it's clear that the image has been edited to exhibit prominent brushstrokes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "Image B shows distinct and exaggerated differences between light and dark areas. The bright yellow highlights on the sofa and the deep blue background create a stark contrast. This high contrast is typical in stylized or artistic renderings where light and shadow are used dramatically for effect. Comparing this with Image A, which has more subdued lighting and less contrast, reinforces the conclusion that Image B has been edited to emphasize these differences.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The elements within Image B, such as the sky, clouds, and landscape in the framed picture, display swirling patterns and dynamic lines. These characteristics are strongly associated with Van Gogh's style, particularly seen in his famous work 'Starry Night.' The analysis of these visual cues, combined with knowledge of Van Gogh's techniques, supports the conclusion that the image exhibits these specific stylistic features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The colors in Image B are vibrant and expressive, deviating significantly from a realistic palette. The bright yellows, deep blues, and vivid greens are not typical of natural lighting and suggest an artistic interpretation. In contrast, Image A uses more muted and realistic colors. This comparison confirms that Image B has been edited to use a more expressive color scheme.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The entire edited image in Image B is consistently styled in a way that resembles Van Gogh's distinctive artistic techniques and style. From the brushstrokes to the color usage and the swirling patterns, every element aligns with Van Gogh's impressionistic approach. This consistency across all aspects of the image indicates a deliberate styling choice to emulate Van Gogh's art style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
