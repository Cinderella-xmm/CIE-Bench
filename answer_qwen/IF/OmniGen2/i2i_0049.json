      "question": "Is only one zebra visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not contain any zebras. Instead, it shows a person skiing against a green gradient background. Therefore, there is no basis for analyzing or describing a zebra in this context.",

      "question": "Has all the grass been removed from the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no grass present in the background of the edited image. The background consists entirely of a green gradient plane. This conclusion is drawn directly from observing the visual content of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the grass area replaced by a green gradient plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the edited image is indeed a uniform green gradient plane. There are no signs of grass or other natural elements, indicating that whatever was previously in the background has been replaced with this gradient.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a calm and solitary atmosphere without extra distractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a single individual skiing against a plain green gradient background. The simplicity of the background and the absence of additional elements contribute to a calm and undistracted atmosphere. Comparing this with Image A, which had a snowy landscape with trees and a 'START' banner, the edited image removes these distractions, enhancing the sense of solitude.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no zebra present in either the original or the edited image. The subject in both images is a person skiing. Thus, the question about a zebra's position and appearance is irrelevant to the content of the images provided.",
