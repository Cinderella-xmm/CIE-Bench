    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene appears to be constructed with Lego bricks. The person, laundry, and background elements like the laundromat walls, doors, and washing machines all exhibit the characteristic blocky, modular structure typical of Lego constructions. This is evident from the visible studs and uniform shapes that are synonymous with Lego designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The person in Image B is clearly a Lego figure, as indicated by its yellow head, blocky body, and distinct Lego-style limbs. The folded laundry also follows the same Lego aesthetic, with each piece resembling a stack of flat Lego tiles. This representation aligns with how Lego typically depicts objects and characters.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The laundromat environment in Image B, including the walls, doors, and washing machines, is depicted using Lego bricks. The walls have a brick pattern consistent with Lego construction, and the doors and washing machines are simplified into Lego-like forms with circular details for the machine windows. This suggests a complete Lego adaptation of the setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The scene in Image B has a static, constructed appearance typical of a stop-motion diorama. The rigid, blocky nature of the Lego pieces and the precise arrangement of elements give it a crafted, immobile look, which is characteristic of stop-motion scenes built with Lego bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The overall scene composition in Image B maintains the key elements seen in a typical laundromat scenario—such as the person holding laundry outside the facility—but adapts them to the Lego aesthetic. The positioning of the person and the layout of the laundromat remain similar to what one would expect in a real-world scene, ensuring the core composition is preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"
