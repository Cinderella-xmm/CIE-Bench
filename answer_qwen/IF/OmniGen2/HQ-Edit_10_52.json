      "question": "Is the woman depicted in a stylized cartoon form with simplified features and exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B is clearly illustrated in a cartoon style, evident from her large eyes, smooth skin texture, and simplified facial features. Her proportions are also exaggerated compared to realistic human anatomy, such as the larger head-to-body ratio and the more pronounced curves of her dress. This analysis is based on visual cues that align with common characteristics of stylized cartoons.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the dress visibly enlarged and accented with gold highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the dress are indeed enlarged and prominently feature gold highlights. The flowers appear bold and vibrant, with golden outlines and accents that make them stand out against the fabric's background. This observation is consistent with artistic techniques used to emphasize details in stylized illustrations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dress exhibit radiant or luminous color tones, such as glowing or highly saturated hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B displays highly saturated colors, particularly in the green base tone and the bright pink and yellow of the floral patterns. These colors give the impression of radiance and luminosity, which is typical in cartoon-style art where colors are often intensified for visual impact.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are abstract, non-realistic bamboo shadows present in the image to enhance depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any visible bamboo shadows. Instead, it features solid bamboo motifs in the background and writing panel frame. The absence of shadows suggests that depth is created through other means, such as layering and color contrast, rather than shadow effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a blank, bamboo-shaped writing panel framed by soft watercolor bamboo motifs in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a writing panel with a bamboo-like shape and a soft watercolor background featuring bamboo motifs. The panel is blank and lined, suggesting it is meant for writing. The surrounding bamboo motifs add an aesthetic touch that complements the overall theme of the image.",
