      "question": "Have the cabinet and sink been converted into five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show that the cabinet and sink have not been physically transformed into nesting dolls. Instead, there are five separate objects resembling chibi-style Russian nesting dolls placed on a surface in front of the bathtub. The cabinet and sink remain as they were in their original form. This conclusion is drawn from observing the distinct shapes and positions of the cabinet, sink, and dolls.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls organized from biggest to smallest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining the sizes of the nesting dolls in Image B, it is clear that they are arranged in descending order from left to right, with the largest doll on the far left and the smallest on the far right. This arrangement follows the typical organization of nesting dolls, where each subsequent doll is smaller than the one before it.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls positioned along the edge of the bathtub?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B are placed on a flat surface that appears to be the edge of the bathtub. They are aligned in a row along this edge, which is consistent with the placement described in the question. The proximity to the bathtub and the alignment confirm this observation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the aspect ratio of the edited image maintained at 3:2 horizontally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the aspect ratio, one would typically measure the width and height of the image. However, based on visual inspection alone, Image B appears square-like, suggesting an aspect ratio closer to 1:1 rather than 3:2. Without precise measurements, the assumption is made based on the apparent proportions of the image.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls exhibit a chibi-style design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B display characteristics commonly associated with chibi-style designs, such as exaggeratedly large heads, small bodies, and simplified facial features. These elements are typical of chibi art, which aims to create cute and endearing characters. The visual cues in the image align with this style.",
