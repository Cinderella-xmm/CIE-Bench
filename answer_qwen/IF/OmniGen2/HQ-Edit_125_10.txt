{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The title on the box reads 'VILAKANES THES', which does not match 'Voyage of the Vikings'. While the typography is bold and readable, the content of the text does not correspond to the given phrase. Therefore, based on the visual information provided, the specific title mentioned in the question is not displayed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The circular knotwork pattern from the sail is present on the box cover but is not integrated into a grid or path system within the box artwork.

}

{
    "Question": "Q6:",
    "explanation": "The side panels of the game box do not feature a visible wooden texture or grain pattern. Instead, they display additional artwork and text related to the game's theme.
