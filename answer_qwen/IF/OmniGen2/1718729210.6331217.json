      "question": "Is the scarecrow presented within a box-like packaging structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarecrow is clearly enclosed within a rectangular frame that resembles a box. This frame has a base with text and sides that extend upwards, enclosing the scarecrow. The presence of this structure suggests it is designed to hold or display the scarecrow, much like packaging. The analysis is based on the visual cues of the structured edges and the way the scarecrow is positioned centrally within these boundaries.",

      "question": "Does the background feature a nighttime farm scene with a dark sky, stars, and a field under moonlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background that includes a dark sky with visible stars and what appears to be a full moon casting light. There are also elements resembling a farm scene, such as fences and houses with lit windows, which suggest a rural setting. The combination of these elements aligns with the description of a nighttime farm scene under moonlight.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the scarecrow's body been replaced with glossy, weather-resistant materials instead of natural straw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scarecrow in Image B still appears to have a body made of natural straw, as indicated by the texture and appearance of the material. There are no visual cues suggesting that the straw has been replaced with glossy or weather-resistant materials. The analysis is based on the visual texture and common knowledge of how straw looks compared to other materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the scarecrow's hat designed with a visible cavity or opening suitable for holding a candle, indicating it is a detachable candle holder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scarecrow's hat in Image B does not show any visible cavity or opening that would suggest it can hold a candle. The hat appears solid and consistent with typical scarecrow hats, lacking features that would indicate its use as a candle holder. The conclusion is drawn from the lack of such design elements in the visual presentation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are LED string lights visibly present in the image, either on or near the scarecrow or packaging, emitting a soft glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed small, round lights arranged around the base of the packaging structure that resemble LED string lights. These lights emit a soft glow, contributing to the overall ambiance of the scene. The presence and function of these lights are evident from their placement and illumination.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a decorative crow figurine placed on top of the box packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a black bird perched on the right side of the scarecrow's arm, which is part of the box-like structure. Given its position and appearance, it can be reasonably interpreted as a decorative crow figurine. The analysis is based on the visual characteristics of the bird and its placement relative to the scarecrow and packaging.",
