      "question": "Is the Great Wall and surrounding mountains rendered as a miniature 3D model rather than a full-scale photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Great Wall and surrounding mountains in Image B appear to be a miniature 3D model due to their small size relative to the snow globe they are enclosed in. The level of detail and the proportions suggest that this is not a full-scale photograph but rather a scaled-down representation. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues of the object's placement within a snow globe, which typically contains miniature models.",
