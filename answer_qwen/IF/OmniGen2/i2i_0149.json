      "question": "Does the cat’s head extend slightly beyond the frame edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's head is fully within the frame boundaries. There are no visual cues indicating that any part of the head extends beyond the edges of the image. The ears and facial features are clearly visible and contained within the frame.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the curled tongue show clear spatial depth, giving a 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The curled tongue in Image B appears to have a three-dimensional quality due to its curvature and shading. The lighting highlights the tongue's surface, creating shadows that enhance its depth and make it stand out from the rest of the face, contributing to a 3D effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the position and angle of the cat’s head create a visual illusion of peeking out from the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat's head in Image B is positioned centrally and does not appear to be at an angle that would suggest it is peeking out from the frame. The head is fully visible and aligned with the body, maintaining a direct and frontal perspective.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a natural appearance for the cat, aside from the instructed modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Aside from the exaggeratedly curled tongue, which is an artificial modification, the rest of the cat's features in Image B appear natural. The fur texture, eye color, and overall posture align with typical characteristics of a real cat.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the edits seamlessly integrated with the rest of the image, with no noticeable artificial artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The curled tongue in Image B is well-integrated into the image without obvious signs of artificiality. The lighting and shadow on the tongue match the rest of the image, and there are no visible seams or distortions that would indicate poor integration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
