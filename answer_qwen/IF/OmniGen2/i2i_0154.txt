    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image contain the front view of the sports car?",
    "explanation": "The edited image shows a side profile of the car, with no visible front-facing details such as headlights or grille. The orientation and angle clearly indicate that the car is viewed from its side rather than the front. Therefore, based on visual cues and common sense about car views, the front view is not present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the edited image contain the side view of the sports car?",
    "explanation": "The edited image displays a clear side profile of the car, showing elements like the wheels, doors, and windows in alignment typical of a side view. This perspective allows for an unobstructed view of the car's length and design features along its sides, confirming it as a side view.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image contain the top view of the sports car?",
    "explanation": "Below the side view of the car, there is a line drawing depicting the car from above. This top-down perspective reveals the roofline, windows, and overall shape of the car as seen from directly overhead, which is characteristic of a top view.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the front, side, and top views visibly combined into a single image?",
    "explanation": "The edited image includes a side view of the car in color and a top view as a line drawing beneath it. However, there is no front view present in the image. Thus, while two views are combined, all three (front, side, and top) are not included together.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the combined image clear, appropriately scaled, and presented professionally for the specified uses?",
    "explanation": "The side view is rendered in high detail with realistic colors and shading, while the top view is a clean line drawing. Both are well-aligned and scaled relative to each other, suggesting professional presentation suitable for design or promotional purposes. The absence of a front view does not detract from the clarity and professionalism of the existing views.",
    "answer": "Yes"
