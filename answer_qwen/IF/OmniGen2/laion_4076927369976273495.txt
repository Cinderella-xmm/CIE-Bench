    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "The building in Image B appears to be a three-dimensional diorama due to its physical structure, visible depth, and the way it is enclosed within a glass dome. The perspective and shadows suggest a tangible object rather than a flat image. This conclusion is drawn from observing the realistic proportions and details that are consistent with a miniature model.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "Image B shows the diorama of the Parisian building enclosed within a glass dome, not an ornate antique streetlamp. The structure surrounding the diorama is transparent and cylindrical, resembling a display case rather than a streetlamp. Therefore, based on visual cues and common sense about the appearance of streetlamps, this option is incorrect.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "In Image B, the balconies on the building are indeed rendered as miniature and intricately detailed ironwork.

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:"
    "explanation": "There are no visible Parisian streets around the base of the diorama in Image B.

This conclusion is based on the lack of street features such as cobblestones, vehicles, or pedestrians.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:"
    "explanation": "The base of the diorama in Image B does not appear to be made of cobblestones. Instead, it looks like a smooth, possibly wooden or plastic surface designed to support the diorama.

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7:"

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
