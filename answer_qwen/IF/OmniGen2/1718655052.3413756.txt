    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a wooden lion head with visible carving marks and engraved textures that mimic fur. The material appears to be wood due to its grainy texture and color. There are no hats or scarves present in this image; instead, it features a LEGO base, which suggests that the question's premise does not apply to this image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "Image B shows a lion head made of wood placed on a green LEGO base. There is no dog or fur coat present in this image. Therefore, the concept of a dog's fur coat being replaced with LEGO bricks does not apply here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is indeed a plain, light-colored wooden tabletop. This provides a clean contrast to the wooden lion head and the green LEGO base, ensuring that there are no distracting elements in the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:"
    "explanation": "Image B features a lion head with distinct facial features such as eyes, nose, mouth, and expression that are characteristic of a lion rather than a dog. Thus, comparing these features to those of a dog from Image A is not applicable.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:"
    "explanation": "The lion head in Image B is made of wood and placed on a green LEGO base. There are no LEGO bricks forming a coat, nor are there warm colors like orange, red, yellow, or brown used for any part of the lion head or base.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:"
    "explanation": "There is no falling snow depicted in Image B. The scene consists of a wooden lion head on a LEGO base against a plain wooden background, making the presence of snow illogical in this context.",
    "answer": "No"
}
