        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects that were previously makeup brushes in Image A have been transformed into what appear to be sculpted crystal wands. The handles are transparent and resemble glass or crystal, and the tips are adorned with gemstones instead of bristles. This transformation is evident through the visual cues such as the transparency of the handles and the presence of gemstones.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container appears to be a transparent crystal vase with visible etched patterns that resemble floral designs. The transparency and the intricate patterns are clearly visible, suggesting it is made of crystal or a similar material. Comparing this with Image A, where the container was a simple glass jar with beads, the change is notable and aligns with the description.",
