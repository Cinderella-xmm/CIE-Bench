      "question": "Is the marble top replaced by a crown-shaped structure with visible gemstone inlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the figure is adorned with a golden crown featuring blue and purple gemstones. This observation is based on the visual cues of the crown's shape and the presence of colored stones, which are not typical features of a marble top. The conclusion is drawn from the distinct appearance of the crown compared to common marble textures and patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the cabinet’s body been replaced with a fabric-like, patterned robe design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the body of the figure covered in a red fabric with gold floral patterns, resembling a robe. This is evident from the texture and the way it drapes over the figure. The analysis is based on the visual characteristics of fabric and the ornate patterns that are inconsistent with the wooden texture seen in typical cabinets.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the drawer engravings reimagined as detailed, ornamental belt buckles positioned across the midsection of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drawers in Image B have been transformed into what appear to be ornamental belt buckles. These are located around the midsection of the figure and feature intricate designs that resemble belt hardware rather than traditional drawer handles. The reasoning is based on the placement and design elements that align more with belts than drawers.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the cabinet’s legs been transformed into clawed, regal feet resembling those of a noble creature or warrior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower part of the figure in Image B displays clawed feet, which are distinctly different from the typical legs of a cabinet. These feet have sharp claws and a robust design that suggests they belong to a creature or character rather than furniture. The conclusion is drawn from the clear animalistic features that contrast with standard cabinet legs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the drawers now resemble openable pouches attached to the robe, mimicking adventurer-style gear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drawers in Image B have been redesigned to look like openable pouches integrated into the robe. They are positioned along the sides of the figure and have a design that suggests functionality similar to gear worn by adventurers. This is inferred from their placement and the style, which is consistent with portable storage solutions for characters in fantasy settings.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict a standing anthropomorphic figure with a crown, robe, and clawed feet, clearly derived from the original cabinet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts an anthropomorphic figure with human-like posture, wearing a crown, a robe, and having clawed feet. The overall form retains elements reminiscent of the original cabinet but has been creatively reimagined into a character. This conclusion is reached by observing the combination of features that transform the inanimate object into a living entity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the materials and textures consistent with royal or adventurer attire (e.g., fabric, gemstones, metal, leather)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The materials and textures in Image B include fabric for the robe, gemstones in the crown, metallic elements in the belt buckles and crown, and leather-like material for the pouches. These materials are commonly associated with royal or adventurer attire, suggesting a deliberate choice to evoke such themes. The analysis is based on the visual representation of these materials and their typical use in costume design.",
