      "question": "Has the original layout of the mirror and faucet been retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror is still centrally positioned above the sink with a similar shape and lighting around it. The faucet remains in the same location on the sink. Based on these observations, the layout appears consistent with common design practices for bathroom fixtures. There are no visible changes to suggest a different arrangement.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the wall materials been changed to reflect classical Roman architectural aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Classical Roman architecture often features materials like marble, stone, or plaster with a textured finish. In Image B, the walls appear smooth and painted in a light color, which does not align with typical Roman materials. Therefore, the wall materials do not seem to reflect classical Roman aesthetics.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the lighting been altered to reflect classical Roman architectural aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Roman lighting typically involved natural light from large windows or skylights and sometimes oil lamps. In Image B, the lighting includes modern hanging bulbs and a lit mirror, which are not characteristic of Roman lighting methods. Thus, the lighting has not been altered to reflect classical Roman aesthetics.",

      "question": "Has the plant decor been changed to match classical Roman architectural aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plant decor consists of simple branches in a pot, which is a modern decorative choice. Classical Roman decor might include more elaborate arrangements or specific types of plants that were common in their era. Since the plant decor does not reflect Roman styles, it has not been changed accordingly.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall scene now feature elements typical of a Roman-style bathhouse, such as columns, arches, or frescoes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A Roman-style bathhouse would typically include architectural elements like columns, arches, and frescoes. In Image B, there are no visible columns, arches, or frescoes. The scene retains a modern aesthetic with clean lines and contemporary fixtures, indicating that it does not feature Roman-style elements.",
