      "question": "Has the entire figure been rendered in a mosaic style composed of small, interlocking tesserae?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show that the figure is indeed composed of small, interlocking pieces that resemble tesserae. This is evident from the texture and pattern across the entire image, including the armor, wings, and background. The use of such a style is characteristic of mosaic art, where images are created using small colored stones or tiles. By observing the uniformity and the way these pieces fit together to form larger shapes and colors, it can be concluded that the entire figure has been rendered in this manner.",

      "question": "Have the metallic components of the armor been replaced with shimmering tesserae that simulate the appearance of mosaic tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor appears to be made up of small, shiny pieces that mimic the look of mosaic tiles. These pieces reflect light in a way that suggests they are meant to represent metallic components through the use of tesserae. The reflective quality and the arrangement of these pieces give the impression of metal while adhering to the mosaic style. Therefore, it can be deduced that the metallic parts have been stylized as shimmering tesserae.",

      "explanation": "Image B shows the armor adorned with complex geometric patterns formed by the tesserae.

These colors are strategically placed to create an intricate design that enhances the visual appeal of the armor. The combination of these elements aligns with traditional mosaic techniques that often employ such color schemes for decorative purposes.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a circular motif with a bright center that radiates outward, surrounded by decorative borders. This design is similar to depictions of celestial domes in ancient Christian art, where such elements symbolize divine presence and glory.
