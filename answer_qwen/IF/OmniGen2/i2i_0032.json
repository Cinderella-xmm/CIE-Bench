      "question": "Have all five ingredients—banana, chocolate chips, butter, eggs, and flour—been converted into chibi-style illustration stickers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements include a banana and eggs depicted in a chibi-style illustration. There are no visible representations of chocolate chips, butter, or flour in this image. The analysis is based on identifying common food items typically used in baking and checking their presence in the chibi form. Since only two out of five ingredients are present, it can be concluded that not all required ingredients have been converted into stickers.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each chibi-style sticker in Image B includes both an expression (such as smiling faces) and an action (like the banana holding its stem or the egg standing upright). This conclusion is drawn by observing the facial features and body language of each character, which convey personality and movement typical of chibi illustrations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style illustration stickers in Image B exhibit cute design traits with bright colors, simple shapes, and friendly expressions.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana is shown winking and holding its stem, while the eggs are depicted with various expressions but do not perform specific actions like doing a peace sign. The analysis involves examining the expressions and actions of each illustrated ingredient and comparing them to the examples provided in the question. While some expressions and actions are present, not all specified examples are observed.",
