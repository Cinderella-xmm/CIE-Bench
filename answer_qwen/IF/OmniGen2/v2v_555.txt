    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show a spherical object with miniature structures inside, resting on what appears to be a base. The presence of snow-like material at the bottom and small white specks resembling snowflakes suggests a snow globe design. This is further supported by the enclosed nature of the objects within the sphere, which is characteristic of a snow globe. Therefore, the latte art from Image A has been transformed into a snow globe design.",

    "Question": "Q4:"
    "explanation": "The glass surface of the snow globe in Image B reflects light, creating a subtle glow around the edges and on the structures inside. This reflection is consistent with the presence of warm lighting in the environment, enhancing the overall appearance of the snow globe. Hence, warm, gentle lighting does reflect off the glass surface, creating a subtle glow.",

    "Question": "Q5:"
    "explanation": "Inside the snow globe in Image B, there are two distinct miniature structures: one resembling the Colosseum and the other resembling Big Ben. These structures are recognizable due to their iconic architectural features, such as the arches of the Colosseum and the clock tower of Big Ben. Therefore, miniature versions of these landmarks are present within the snow globe.",

    "Question": "Q6:"
    "explanation": "Within the snow globe in Image B, there are small white specks scattered throughout the space, which visually resemble softly drifting snowflakes. These specks add to the illusion of a snowy scene, complementing the miniature structures inside the globe. Thus, there are indeed softly drifting snowflakes surrounding the miniature structures.",
