    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the explosion depicted as a mural painted on a beach wall, rather than occurring naturally in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The explosion in Image B appears as a stylized, cartoonish depiction with thick black outlines and vibrant colors. It is situated against a backdrop that includes palm trees and a beach, suggesting it is part of a mural or artistic rendering rather than a natural occurrence. The flatness and lack of depth further imply it's painted on a surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the explosion and surrounding elements bright and neon-like, consistent with pop art aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The explosion and surrounding elements in Image B are rendered in bright, neon-like colors such as pink, yellow, and blue, which are characteristic of pop art aesthetics. These colors stand out vividly against the background, emphasizing their artificial and stylized nature.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All major elements in Image B, including the explosion, clouds, palm trees, and landforms, are outlined with thick black lines. This technique is commonly used in pop art to define shapes and create a bold visual impact.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm trees in Image B are depicted with exaggerated forms and bold outlines, consistent with pop art styles. They are simplified and stylized, lacking realistic details, which aligns with the overall aesthetic of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no visible geometric patterns such as stripes, grids, or polygons embedded within the cloud formations of the explosion in Image B. The clouds maintain a smooth, rounded shape typical of pop art illustrations.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The island landscape in Image B has been transformed into simplified abstract shapes. The landform lacks realistic terrain details and is represented by a single, solid color with a thick outline, which is a common feature in pop art.",
