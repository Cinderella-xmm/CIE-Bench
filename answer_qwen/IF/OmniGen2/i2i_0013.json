      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B appears to have a simplified and stylized design with soft, rounded edges and a playful expression, which are characteristic of kawaii art. The overall aesthetic is cute and cartoonish, aligning with the kawaii style often seen in enamel pins. This conclusion is drawn from observing the visual cues such as the exaggerated features and the lack of detailed realism.",

      "question": "Are there glossy metal outlines present on the pin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject does not exhibit any reflective or shiny qualities that would suggest glossy metal outlines. The lines appear smooth and uniform without any highlights or reflections typically associated with metallic surfaces. Therefore, based on the visual information, there are no glossy metal outlines present.",

      "question": "Does the pin have vibrant enamel fill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the subject with solid colors that are bright and distinct, resembling the appearance of enamel fills used in pins. These colors are vivid and evenly distributed, suggesting a vibrant enamel-like quality. The analysis is based on the observation of the color saturation and uniformity typical of enamel designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the focus remains solely on the subject with no additional elements or features incorporated into the design. The background is plain white, and there are no other objects or embellishments visible. Thus, it can be concluded that no extra features have been added beyond the subject.",

      "question": "Is the mockup in a square format?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the subject against a white background, but there are no clear borders or framing that indicate a specific format like square. However, judging by the proportions and layout, the image seems to maintain a square aspect ratio, which is common for enamel pin mockups. This assessment is made based on the visual balance and symmetry observed.",

      "question": "Is the background of the mockup white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is entirely white, providing a clean and neutral backdrop that highlights the subject. This is a standard practice in displaying enamel pins to ensure the design stands out clearly. The analysis is straightforward as the absence of any other colors or patterns confirms the white background.",
