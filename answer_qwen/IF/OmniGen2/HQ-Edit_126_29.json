      "question": "Is the room visually transformed into a thematic infographic with Victorian literature elements, including layout and design consistent with an educational or narrative display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements such as the ornate clock design, the open book with text, and the decorative borders suggest a thematic infographic. The layout includes an educational or narrative display style typical of Victorian literature, with a focus on timekeeping. The combination of these elements creates a cohesive theme that aligns with the question's description.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the clock face been replaced with a visual representation of a book with animated or implied page-turning motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock face in Image B has been replaced by an open book illustration. This is evident from the visible pages and text within the book, which are not features of a traditional clock face. The implied page-turning motion is suggested by the open book format, which is a common way to represent reading or storytelling in infographics.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a framed artwork above the fireplace. Instead, it focuses on the clock and the open book, without any landscape or sundial imagery present in the frame. Therefore, there is no comparison to be made regarding the content of the framed artwork.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock hands in Image B are designed as stylized pens, integrated into the book cover illustration on the clock face. This can be observed where the clock hands appear to be part of the pen drawing at the top of the open book, fitting the description provided in the question.",
