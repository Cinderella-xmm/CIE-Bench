    "Question": "Q1: Do the zebra's stripes extend outward and integrate seamlessly with the grass?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes appear to continue into the surrounding environment, which is depicted as a black-and-white striped pattern. This creates an illusion where the zebra's stripes seem to blend into the background. The transition appears seamless because there are no visible breaks or abrupt changes in the stripe pattern between the zebra and the ground.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the grassland rendered in a black-and-white striped pattern?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the ground covered in a black-and-white striped pattern that matches the zebra's stripes. This is not a natural depiction of grass but rather an artistic choice that aligns with the surrealistic style of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the image exhibit a surrealistic style, creating an imaginative blend between the zebra and the environment?",
    "explanation": "The combination of the zebra's stripes extending into the environment and the unnatural black-and-white striped grassland indicates a surrealistic style. This artistic approach blends the subject (zebra) with its surroundings in an imaginative and non-realistic way, challenging typical perceptions of nature.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there any abrupt transitions or breaks where the zebra's stripes meet the grass?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes flow continuously into the striped pattern of the ground without any noticeable breaks or abrupt transitions. The design maintains a consistent visual rhythm, enhancing the surreal effect.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the zebra's original body proportion been maintained despite the extension of its stripes?",
    "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the zebra's body proportions appear unchanged. The extension of the stripes into the environment does not affect the physical dimensions or shape of the zebra itself. The surrealistic elements do not distort the zebra's form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
