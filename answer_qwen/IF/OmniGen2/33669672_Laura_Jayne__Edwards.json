      "question": "Is the figure rendered as a bronze sculpture with a metallic surface finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B exhibits a uniform, reflective golden-brown hue that is characteristic of bronze sculptures. The smooth and polished appearance suggests a metallic surface finish. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues of the glossy texture and the way light reflects off the surface, which are typical of bronze materials used in sculptures.",

      "question": "Are the limbs visibly elongated compared to natural human proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the figure appear to be proportionally longer than what would typically be seen in a natural human body. This observation is based on the exaggerated length of the arms and legs relative to the torso, which deviates from standard anatomical proportions. Such elongation is often employed in artistic representations to emphasize elegance or movement.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the legs form smooth, curved shapes that suggest dynamic movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The legs in Image B display smooth curves and lines that convey a sense of motion. The positioning of the legs, along with the slight bend at the knees and the angle of the feet, creates an impression of dynamic movement. This analysis is supported by the fluidity of the lines and the overall posture of the figure, which suggests a flowing, graceful action.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have all floral elements been replaced with geometric patterns consistent with Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B still contains floral elements attached to the boots, which have not been replaced with geometric patterns. The presence of these flowers indicates that the original floral design has been retained. Therefore, it can be concluded that the floral elements have not been substituted with Art Deco-style geometric patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image rendered in metallic tones while preserving the original color scheme (teal, red, pink)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are predominantly metallic gold, but the teal dress and red boots maintain their original hues, albeit with a metallic sheen. The pink flowers retain their color as well. Thus, while the overall tone is metallic, the original color scheme has been preserved with a metallic finish.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background a solid, uniform turquoise color matching the overall aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a solid, uniform turquoise color. This choice complements the metallic tones of the figure and the remaining colored elements, creating a cohesive aesthetic. The uniformity of the background enhances the focus on the figure without distraction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the adornments on the figure composed of symmetrical, angular, or repetitive geometric motifs typical of Art Deco style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The adornments on the figure in Image B do not exhibit symmetrical, angular, or repetitive geometric motifs typical of Art Deco. Instead, they consist of floral elements and jewelry that do not conform to the strict geometric patterns associated with Art Deco design. Therefore, the adornments do not align with Art Deco characteristics.",
