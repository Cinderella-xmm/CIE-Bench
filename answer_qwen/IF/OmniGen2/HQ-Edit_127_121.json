        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spider in Image B has been transformed with features that are not typical of a realistic spider. It possesses wings and other fantastical elements, which align more with mythical creatures or dream-like entities rather than real spiders. The presence of these non-realistic features suggests a mythical interpretation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The abdomen of the spider in Image B does not appear as a luminous orb displaying moving light patterns. Instead, it maintains a more solid and realistic texture compared to the rest of the fantastical elements. Therefore, this specific transformation has not occurred.",
