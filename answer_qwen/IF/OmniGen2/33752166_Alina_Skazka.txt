{
    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the building has been edited to include mechanical features such as articulated limbs and exposed gears. The addition of these elements is evident through the presence of large, robotic arms extending from the structure, which are not typical architectural features. This transformation aligns with the concept of a mechanical golem, where inanimate objects are given mechanical life.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show all original windows replaced with glowing energy panels emitting light. While there are some changes to the building's appearance, the windows still retain their original form and do not emit any visible light. Therefore, this specific transformation has not occurred.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the balconies have indeed been transformed into arm-like mechanical appendages. These appendages extend outward from the building, resembling robotic arms, which is a significant departure from the standard design of balconies seen in Image A. This change suggests a creative reimagining of the building's structural elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "Image B shows intricate circuit patterns covering parts of the building's surface. These patterns resemble electronic wiring or circuits, adding to the mechanical and technological theme of the edited image. This detail enhances the impression that the building has been transformed into a giant mechanical entity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The angular edges of the building in Image B appear as dynamic mechanical components. Features like hinges, pistons, and rotating joints are visible, suggesting that parts of the building can move or articulate. This gives the building a more animated and functional mechanical appearance compared to its static form in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B remains a clear blue sky without any noticeable changes or additions. There are no new elements introduced into the sky, and it maintains the same clarity and color as in Image A. This consistency indicates that the focus of the edits was on the building itself rather than the surrounding environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7:",
    "explanation": "The buildingâ€™s overall size and position within the frame have remained consistent between Image A and Image B. Despite the added mechanical features, the building retains its original proportions and placement in the composition. This suggests that the edits were applied while preserving the building's fundamental spatial relationship within the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
