    "Question": "Q4: Does the edited image have a horizontal aspect ratio of 3:2?",
    "explanation": "To determine the aspect ratio, we would need to measure the width and height of the image. However, based on visual inspection, the image appears taller than it is wide, suggesting a vertical orientation rather than a horizontal one. A 3:2 aspect ratio typically indicates a landscape orientation, which does not match the observed portrait orientation of the image.",
    "answer": "No"
