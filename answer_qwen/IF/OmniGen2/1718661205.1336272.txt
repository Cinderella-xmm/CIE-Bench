    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The military ship in Image B is clearly constructed from LEGO bricks, as evidenced by the visible brick patterns and modular construction. The structure of the ship shows distinct LEGO elements such as studs and interlocking pieces, which are characteristic of LEGO models. This conclusion is drawn from observing the uniformity and repetitive pattern typical of LEGO constructions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The ocean waves in Image B are depicted using blue LEGO bricks arranged to form a textured surface that resembles water.

    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The boatâ€™s deck in Image B includes small, detailed LEGO accessories such as railings, panels, and equipment that replicate real deck features. These details are evident through the presence of various LEGO pieces that are strategically placed to represent functional parts of a ship's deck. The reasoning is based on recognizing the complexity and specificity of the LEGO components used.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no person wearing a life vest or shirt; instead, there is a LEGO minifigure standing on the ship. Therefore, it is not possible for the clothing to have a blocky, brick-like appearance as described. The question assumes the presence of items that do not exist in this image, making the comparison invalid.",
    "answer": "No"
