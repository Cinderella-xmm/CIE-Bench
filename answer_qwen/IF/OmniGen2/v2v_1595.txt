    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a pattern of dots that vary in size and density. This is characteristic of a halftone pattern, which is commonly used to create shades and gradients in graphic design. The dots are arranged in such a way that they give the illusion of smooth color transitions, even though they are made up of discrete elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a strong contrast between its elements. The soccer ball and goalpost are outlined in bright blue against a vivid red background with orange halftone dots. These colors are complementary and highly saturated, creating a visually striking effect. The high contrast makes each element stand out clearly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The soccer ball and goalpost in Image B have clean, sharp edges. The outlines are bold and well-defined, with no blurring or softening at the borders. This sharpness contributes to the graphic and stylized appearance of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "Both the soccer ball and goalpost in Image B have been simplified into bold, graphic forms. The soccer ball retains its classic black-and-white pentagon pattern but is depicted with fewer details and more emphasis on shape. Similarly, the goalpost is reduced to basic geometric shapes with a clear outline, making them easily recognizable yet stylized.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The overall visual effect of Image B is indeed striking. The vibrant red background combined with the contrasting blue and white elements creates a dynamic composition. The use of halftone patterns adds depth and texture, while the bold lines and colors make the image visually engaging and energetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
