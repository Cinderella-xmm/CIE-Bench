      "question": "Has the guitar body been transformed into an armored torso with clear armor-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar body does not exhibit any features resembling armor. The visual cues show a wooden texture typical of a guitar's construction, and there are no signs of metallic or armored plating. The analysis is based on the visible wood grain and lack of any structural elements that would suggest armor.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the guitar body exhibit a metallic, deep mahogany finish with visible reflective qualities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The guitar body in Image B shows a deep mahogany color but lacks metallic qualities. The surface appears to have a matte wood finish rather than a reflective metallic one. This conclusion is drawn from the absence of highlights or reflections that would be present on a metallic surface.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes blue glowing outlines around the figure emerging from the guitar, which give the impression of motion or energy. These lines are stylized and enhance the dynamic feel of the image, suggesting movement and power emanating from the character.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The guitar strings in Image B remain thin and string-like; they do not resemble thick, muscle-like strands. They maintain their original appearance as part of the guitar's structure, consistent with common knowledge about guitar strings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a luminous cape flowing from the neck area of the guitar. However, it does not feature sound wave motifs. There is also a bright emblem on the headstock, which appears to be part of the character's design rather than a traditional guitar logo.",
