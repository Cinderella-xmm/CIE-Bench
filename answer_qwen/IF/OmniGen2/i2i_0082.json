      "question": "Has the clock been designed with a metallic material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock in Image B has a silver-colored rim that reflects light, suggesting a metallic material. The sheen and reflective properties are consistent with metal finishes commonly used in clocks or badges. This conclusion is drawn from observing the visual cues of the rim's texture and light interaction.",

      "question": "Does the badge pendant preserve the minimalist circular frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock in Image B maintains a simple and uncluttered design with a circular frame. There are no additional decorative elements within the frame, preserving the minimalist aesthetic. This analysis is based on the observation of the clean lines and lack of extraneous details within the circular boundary.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the proportions of the clock hands been preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, both clocks have similar hand proportions relative to the clock face size. The hour, minute, and second hands appear proportionally consistent between the two images. This comparison involves assessing the length and thickness of the hands in relation to the overall clock dimensions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible feature such as a loop or hook indicating the pendant can function as a keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible metallic ring at the top of the clock, which serves as a loop for attaching it to a keychain. This feature is typical for pendants designed to be portable and easily attached to keys or bags. The presence of this loop confirms its functionality as a keychain.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there no additional elements besides those necessary for converting it into a metallic badge pendant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "Image B shows only the essential components for a metallic badge pendant: the clock face, the metallic rim, and the attachment loop. There are no unnecessary embellishments or extra features beyond what is required for its intended use as a keychain clock. This conclusion is based on the absence of any superfluous design elements.",
