      "question": "Is the image presented as a rectangular card with defined borders and structured layout resembling an RPG collectible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is clearly presented as a rectangular card with defined borders and a structured layout. The design includes a title area at the top, an illustration of the character in the center, and stat bars at the bottom, which are common elements in RPG collectible cards. This conclusion is drawn from observing the overall composition and layout of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the name \"Kaitiaki of the Valleys\" displayed on the card, either in a nameplate or title area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The name 'Kaitiaki of the Valleys' is displayed prominently at the top of the card on a carved-wood appearance banner. This is evident from the text's placement and style, which matches the typical design for a character's title or nameplate in such cards.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bold moko patterns on the warrior's face and body clearly visible and unchanged from the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bold moko patterns on the warrior's face and body are visible but appear simplified compared to traditional moko designs. They seem stylized to fit the 3D rendering style of the card. Without comparing directly to Image A, it can be inferred that these patterns may not be exactly as they would be in a more realistic depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the flax piupiu skirt still present and accurately depicted on the warrior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flax piupiu skirt is present on the warrior, depicted with layered fringe details that resemble traditional Maori attire. The style and texture suggest an accurate representation within the artistic constraints of the card's design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the warrior in a wide, dynamic stance with legs apart and arms outstretched, consistent with a haka pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The warrior is not in a wide, dynamic stance with legs apart and arms outstretched. Instead, the pose is more static with feet closer together and arms slightly bent at the sides. This is observed by analyzing the posture and positioning of the limbs in the image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the artwork use a stylized 3D rendering style with rich earthy tones (e.g., deep greens, browns, tans) throughout the character and environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artwork uses a stylized 3D rendering style with rich earthy tones. The character and environment feature deep greens, browns, and tans, contributing to a cohesive and thematic color palette. This is determined by examining the color scheme and artistic style throughout the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background consists of a layered, lush green valley with visible depth and multiple mountain ridges. This creates a sense of a vast natural landscape behind the character, which is typical for depicting a connection to nature in such illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are four stat bars clearly visible with the labels [Courage +10], [Mana +9], [Rhythm +8], and [Leadership +7]?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are only two stat bars visible on the card, labeled 'Courage +10 Mangay' and 'Rhynch Ledershiip'. These do not match the specified labels [Courage +10], [Mana +9], [Rhythm +8], and [Leadership +7]. Therefore, the answer is no based on the discrepancy in the number and content of the stat bars.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is indeed a banner at the top of the card with a carved-wood appearance. It contains the text indicating the character's title, 'Kaitiaki of the Valleys', confirming its presence and purpose as described.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no separate nameplate located below the warrior that displays the name 'Kaitiaki of the Valleys'. The name is instead displayed at the top of the card on the banner. This conclusion is reached by examining the lower portion of the card for any additional text or plates.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The card has a border with a polished metallic finish around its edges. This is evident from the shiny, reflective quality of the border, which gives it a polished look typical of collectible cards designed to appear premium.",
