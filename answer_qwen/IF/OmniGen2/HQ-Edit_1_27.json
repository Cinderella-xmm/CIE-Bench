      "question": "Is the scene enclosed within a visible decorative glass dome that surrounds the entire diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B clearly show a transparent, rounded structure that encapsulates the entire scene. This structure has a base and a lid, resembling a glass dome typically used for dioramas or decorative displays. The reflection and refraction of light on this surface further confirm its glass-like material. Combining this with common knowledge about how such domes are used to protect and display miniature scenes leads to the conclusion that the scene is indeed enclosed within a decorative glass dome.",

      "question": "Does the snow in the scene have a delicate, powdery texture, appearing soft and lightly settled rather than dense or icy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow appears to have a fine, powdery texture, as evidenced by the way it lightly covers the ground and objects without forming dense clumps or icy patches. This observation aligns with the typical appearance of freshly fallen snow, which tends to be soft and loosely packed. Therefore, based on the visual information and common understanding of snow textures, the snow in the scene can be described as delicate and powdery.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all human figures in the scene noticeably smaller in scale and dressed in vintage-style clothing consistent with early 20th-century Parisian fashion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The human figures in Image B are noticeably smaller compared to what would be expected in a real-life setting, suggesting they are part of a miniature scene. Their clothing style, including hats and coats, is consistent with early 20th-century Parisian fashion, which is often depicted in historical contexts. This analysis combines the visual scale of the figures with historical knowledge of fashion trends during that period.",

      "question": "Are the streetlamps in the scene significantly smaller than normal scale and do they emit a soft, subtle glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The streetlamps in Image B are proportionally smaller than what would be seen in a full-scale urban environment, fitting the miniature nature of the scene. They emit a soft, subtle glow, as indicated by the gentle illumination around them and the lack of harsh shadows. This observation is consistent with the use of small light sources in dioramas to create a realistic yet scaled-down ambiance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, leafless trees in the scene with only a light dusting of snow on their branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features small trees that appear leafless, with branches that have a light dusting of snow. This depiction is consistent with winter scenes where deciduous trees have shed their leaves and only a thin layer of snow rests on the branches. The size and detail of the trees suggest they are part of the miniature setup, reinforcing the seasonal and decorative context of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible cobblestone pathways, partially exposed and winding through the snow-covered ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are pathways visible through the snow-covered ground. These pathways appear to be made of cobblestones, partially exposed as the snow settles thinly over them. The winding nature of these paths adds to the charm of the miniature scene, creating a sense of depth and movement. This observation is supported by the visual texture and layout of the ground, which is consistent with cobblestone pathways in snowy environments.",
