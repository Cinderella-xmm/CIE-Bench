    "Question": "Q1: Is the rose bush rendered as a mosaic mural composed of distinct tile-like segments?",
    "explanation": "The image clearly shows a mosaic pattern where the flowers and leaves are composed of small, distinct tiles. Each segment is separated by grout lines, which is characteristic of mosaic art. The visual cues such as the uniformity of the tiles and the structured arrangement confirm that this is indeed a mosaic representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are all flowers outlined with bold, distinct borders resembling ceramic tile edges?",
    "explanation": "In the mosaic mural, each flower is distinctly outlined by the grout between the tiles, giving them a bold border effect typical of ceramic mosaics. This is evident from the clear separation between the white petals and the green leaves, as well as the background tiles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the petals and leaves depicted in shades of pearl (soft white/off-white) and jade (greenish tones), replacing their original colors?",
    "explanation": "The mosaic uses soft white/off-white tiles for the petals and greenish tiles for the leaves, which aligns with the description of pearl and jade tones. These colors are consistent throughout the floral elements, indicating a deliberate choice to use these specific shades in the mosaic design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the red brick building been abstracted using terracotta tile shades (warm earthy tones) instead of realistic red bricks?",
    "explanation": "The surrounding area of the mosaic includes tiles in warm earthy tones that resemble terracotta. These tiles form the border around the mosaic and suggest an abstraction of the red brick building into a similar color palette but in a tiled format.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are architectural features of the building (such as arches or window frames) incorporated into the mosaic pattern as stylized elements?",
    "explanation": "There are no visible architectural features like arches or window frames within the mosaic itself. The mosaic focuses solely on floral patterns without incorporating any structural elements of a building. Therefore, it can be concluded that architectural features are not part of this mosaic design.",
    "answer": "No"
