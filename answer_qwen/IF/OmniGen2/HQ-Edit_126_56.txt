    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are depicted with sharp angles and flat surfaces, lacking the organic contours typically seen in realistic mountain representations. This geometric style is evident from the clear lines and lack of detailed textures that would suggest natural rock formations. The use of flat colors further supports this observation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "The trees in Image B are rendered as simple geometric forms, primarily triangular shapes, without any detailed depiction of leaves or branches. This stylized approach contrasts with a realistic portrayal which would include intricate details of foliage. The absence of such details confirms the geometric nature of the tree representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "The river in Image B is composed of radiating parallel lines that create a sense of depth and direction. These lines do not mimic the reflective properties of water but instead form a structured pattern typical of geometric design. This is different from a continuous body of water which would show reflections and ripples.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:"
    "explanation": "All elements in Image B are outlined with bold, clear lines and filled with solid, unshaded colors. There is no gradient or shading present, which is characteristic of certain artistic styles aiming for clarity and simplicity. This choice enhances the graphic quality of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:"
    "explanation": "The reflection in the water of Image B is indeed a perfectly symmetrical and geometrically aligned mirror image of the foreground elements. This symmetry is achieved through the use of identical geometric shapes above and below the horizon line, creating a mirrored effect that is precise and orderly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:"
    "explanation": "There are no visible gradients or soft shading in Image B. The sky, mountains, and water are all filled with flat, solid colors. This choice contributes to the overall geometric and stylized appearance of the image, emphasizing boldness over subtlety.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7:"
    "explanation": "Image B employs a vibrant, high-contrast color palette including bold hues like red, gold, blue, and black, which are characteristic of Art Deco design. The use of these colors creates a striking visual impact and aligns with the aesthetic principles of the Art Deco style, known for its bold and luxurious color schemes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
