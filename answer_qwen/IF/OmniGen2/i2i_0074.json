      "question": "Is there a visible main cover title that reads \"Ideal Home\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Ideal Home' is prominently displayed at the top in large, bold white letters. This placement and style are typical for magazine titles, designed to catch the viewer's attention immediately. The visual cues of font size, color contrast, and positioning confirm this as the main cover title.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible section headings related to home design incorporated into the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes additional text below the main title that appears to be section headings or subtitles. These texts seem to relate to topics about home design, such as interior tips and room-specific advice, which is common in home design magazines. The layout suggests these are meant to guide readers through different sections of content.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a distinct text module present that provides price recommendations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, there is no specific text module that clearly indicates price recommendations. The text modules present appear to focus on descriptive content rather than pricing information. Price recommendations would typically include monetary values or cost-related terms, which are not evident here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bedroom setting in Image B retains all elements from the original image, such as the bed with its arrangement of pillows and bedding, the wooden furniture, the hanging lamps, and the wall art. The consistency in these elements between both images confirms that the bedroom setup has been preserved in the edited version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is structured similarly to a magazine cover, with a clear main title at the top, followed by section headings and additional text modules. The placement of these elements creates a hierarchical layout typical of magazine covers, guiding the viewer's eye from the title to the detailed content below.",
