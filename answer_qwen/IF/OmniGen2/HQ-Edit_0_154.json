      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly displays a title at the top that reads 'CURRENCIES OF THE WORLD,' which is formatted in bold and capitalized letters, indicating its role as the main heading of the infographic.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of the image is clean and modern, with a white background and neatly arranged elements.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image contains labeled sections with the titles 'USD,' 'QAR,' and 'INR.'

      "question": "Has the wallet been replaced with a schematic blueprint-style drawing featuring clean lines and minimalist form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wallet in the image is not replaced with a schematic blueprint-style drawing. Instead, it appears as a realistic leather wallet with detailed stitching and texture. Therefore, the description of a blueprint-style drawing does not match the visual cues present in the image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no annotations next to each currency slot in the wallet. The wallet simply holds a single banknote without any accompanying text or descriptions. Thus, the presence of such annotations cannot be confirmed based on the visual information provided.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image includes a chart or graph at the bottom left corner. Although the specific data points are not entirely clear, the presence of lines and markers suggests it represents some form of comparison or trend among the currencies mentioned. This supports the idea that the chart displays exchange rate data.",
