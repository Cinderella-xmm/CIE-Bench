      "question": "Is the overall composition stylized with strong geometric lines, symmetry, and decorative elements typical of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition of Image B exhibits strong geometric lines and symmetry, which are characteristic of Art Deco design. The figure is centrally placed with a balanced posture, and the background features linear elements that enhance the sense of order and rhythm typical of Art Deco. Decorative elements such as the chair's armrests and the suit's angular shapes further support this analysis.",
