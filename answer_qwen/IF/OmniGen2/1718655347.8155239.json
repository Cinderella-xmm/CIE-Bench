      "question": "Is the crimson moon replaced by a circular motif made of golden threads, resembling an embroidered pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is depicted as a solid red circle within a yellowish-golden background. The texture and appearance suggest it is part of an embroidered design rather than a realistic depiction of a moon. This conclusion is drawn from the visible thread-like patterns surrounding the moon, which are consistent with embroidery techniques. There is no indication of golden threads forming the moon itself; instead, the moon appears as a filled-in area within the embroidered motif.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the snow-capped mountain peaks transformed into interlocking geometric shapes rather than natural mountain forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows mountain peaks that retain their natural form but are stylized with sharp, angular lines typical of embroidery art. While they are not purely geometric or interlocking shapes, they do have a more structured and less organic appearance compared to realistic mountains. This suggests a transformation towards a stylized representation rather than a complete shift to interlocking geometric shapes.",

      "question": "Are the red trees replaced with stylized embroidery patterns that mimic stitched textile designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are clearly depicted using a style that mimics embroidery. They have a blocky, pixelated appearance with distinct outlines and shading that resemble stitches on fabric. This is evident from the way the colors are segmented and the overall texture of the trees, which aligns with common embroidery techniques.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the surface of the lake rendered as silvery-blue silk strands, giving it a textile-like appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lake in Image B has a wavy, striped pattern that resembles silk strands or embroidered lines. The blue coloration and the way the waves are depicted give it a textile-like quality, suggesting it is meant to represent silk or similar material used in embroidery. This interpretation is supported by the overall embroidered aesthetic of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene exhibit a consistent tapestry-like quality with visible threadwork, stitched textures, and a fabric-based aesthetic across all elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consistently displays characteristics of a tapestry or embroidered artwork. The entire scene, including the moon, mountains, trees, and lake, is rendered with visible threadwork and stitched textures. The uniformity in the style and the fabric-based aesthetic across all elements confirm this observation. This is further supported by the border framing the scene, which is typical of tapestries.",
