    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's figure appears to have exaggerated proportions and simplified features. Her waist is notably slim, and her dress has a very structured, almost unrealistic silhouette. The overall appearance suggests a stylized, cartoon-like aesthetic rather than a realistic human form. This conclusion is drawn from observing the proportions and the smoothness of the lines which are typical in cartoon illustrations.",
