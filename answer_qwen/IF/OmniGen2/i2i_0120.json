        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character appears to have a three-dimensional form with soft edges and a matte finish, which are typical characteristics of a soft vinyl figurine. The lighting and shadows suggest it is a physical object rather than a flat illustration.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
