      "question": "Has the wooden material been replaced with transparent blue and teal crystalline material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is clearly made of a transparent material with hues of blue and teal. The light passes through it, creating a translucent effect that is characteristic of crystalline or glass-like materials. This is distinctly different from the opaque, solid appearance of wood seen in Image A. By combining visual cues such as transparency and color with common knowledge about material properties, it can be concluded that the material has indeed been changed.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the facets and angles of the sculpture accurately represent the fish's scales and curved body structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B features numerous facets and angles that mimic the texture and form of fish scales and the curvature of a fish's body. These geometric patterns are designed to resemble natural elements while maintaining an artistic interpretation. Comparing this to Image A, where the carving also depicts similar details but in a more traditional wooden texture, it is evident that the design intent remains consistent across both images, though the medium differs.",

      "question": "Does the sculpture exhibit glossy, reflective surfaces that suggest water-like fluidity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the sculpture in Image B appears glossy and reflective, which is typical for polished glass or crystal. These reflective qualities give the impression of fluidity and movement, akin to water. This observation is supported by the way light interacts with the sculpture, enhancing its dynamic and flowing appearance. In contrast, Image A does not exhibit such reflective properties due to its wooden nature.",

      "question": "Is the sculpture presented in a minimalist white gallery space with no visible distractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sculpture placed in a setting with plain white walls and a neutral floor, which is characteristic of a minimalist gallery space. This environment focuses attention solely on the artwork without any distractions. Comparing this to Image A, which has a textured background that could be interpreted as a wall or backdrop, the setting in Image B is more definitively minimalist.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sculpture mounted on a sleek, mirrored pedestal that reflects its image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B is displayed on a white pedestal that appears smooth and possibly reflective, as it mirrors some aspects of the sculpture. This enhances the overall presentation by adding depth and dimension. While Image A does not feature a pedestal, the presence of a reflective base in Image B contributes significantly to the aesthetic appeal of the piece.",
