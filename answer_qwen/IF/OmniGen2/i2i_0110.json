        "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background shows a window with horizontal slats that are characteristic of venetian blinds. There is a bright light source behind the blinds, creating a pattern of light and shadow consistent with sunlight filtering through them. This visual cue strongly suggests the presence of sunlight streaming through venetian blinds.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vase containing sunflowers is centrally located and prominently displayed on the table. Its vibrant colors and detailed depiction draw the viewer's attention immediately.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in the image creates distinct patterns of light and shadow that correspond to the gaps between the venetian blinds. These patterns are cast onto the walls and surfaces, mimicking the effect of sunlight passing through blinds. This observation supports the conclusion that the light and shadow effects are consistent with sunlight flowing through blinds.",
