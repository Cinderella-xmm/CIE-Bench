      "question": "Does the edited image show the smartwatch transformed into a full cybernetic wrist dragon with dragon-like anatomy integrated into the wrist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a smartwatch with a metallic band and a watch face that has been altered to display a holographic dragon eye. There are no visual cues or anatomical features resembling a dragon integrated into the wrist, nor is there any indication of cybernetic transformation beyond the watch itself. The analysis is based on the visible elements in the image without assuming additional content not present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the watch face replaced with a radiant, multi-layered holographic dragon eye featuring glowing elements and depth effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The watch face in the edited image displays a radiant, multi-layered holographic design that resembles a dragon eye with glowing elements and depth effects. This conclusion is drawn from the visual characteristics of the watch face, which include concentric circles with varying intensities of light and color gradients that suggest a three-dimensional appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original silicone band and its contours replaced with a series of interlocking, metallic silver scales that cover the wrist portion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the original silicone band has been replaced with a series of interlocking metallic silver scales that cover the wrist portion. This is evident from the texture and pattern of the band, which now mimics the look of scales rather than the smooth surface of silicone. The analysis is based on comparing the visual texture and structure of the band in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the digital crown been replaced with a glowing, spherical neural node emitting light or energy pulses, resembling a biotech interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital crown in the edited image remains a physical, non-glowing component and does not resemble a biotech interface emitting light or energy pulses. It retains its original shape and function as a mechanical control element. The conclusion is reached by observing the unchanged appearance and lack of luminescent or dynamic features on the digital crown.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the original app icons on the watch face replaced with glowing, rune-like control sigils that emit light and reflect a tech-magic aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The app icons on the watch face have been replaced with glowing, rune-like symbols that emit light and reflect a tech-magic aesthetic. This is observed through the distinct shapes and glowing outlines of the icons, which differ from typical app icons and align with the description of rune-like control sigils.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image display a dynamic form with visual cues such as energy flow, motion lines, or an active posture that conveys movement and life?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not display dynamic forms such as energy flow, motion lines, or an active posture that conveys movement and life. The watch and its components appear static, with no visual cues suggesting motion or activity beyond the stationary display of the holographic dragon eye.",
