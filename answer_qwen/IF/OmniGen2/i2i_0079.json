        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, there is no clearly defined collectible figure present. The objects on the dresser include a vase with flowers, some books, and decorative items like candles and a lantern, but none of these can be classified as a collectible figure. The analysis process involves identifying each object based on its shape, size, and context within the room setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there is no collectible figure present in Image B, this question does not apply. However, if we were to consider the placement of existing objects, they are placed on the dresser which is suitable for desk ornaments. The comparison with Image A would show similar placement of objects, confirming that the surface is appropriate for such items.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As there is no collectible figure in Image B, it cannot maintain visual harmony with the overall composition of the room. The existing objects on the dresser contribute to the aesthetic balance, but a non-existent figure cannot influence this harmony. Comparing with Image A shows consistency in the arrangement of objects without any disruption.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Without a collectible figure in Image B, it cannot obscure or overshadow key elements such as the mirror or existing decorations. The mirror and other decorations remain prominent and unobstructed. Comparing with Image A confirms that the scene remains unchanged in terms of visibility of key elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there is no collectible figure in Image B, it cannot be integrated into the scene. The existing objects appear naturally placed and harmonious with the room's design. Comparing with Image A shows that the absence of a new figure maintains the seamless integration of the current composition.",
