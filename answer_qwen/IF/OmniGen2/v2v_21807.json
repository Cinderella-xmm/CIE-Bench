      "question": "Are the outlines of the clock tower and surrounding elements strong and well-defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower and its surroundings are depicted with bold, clear lines that sharply define their shapes. The edges of the tower, arches, and even the cars on the road are outlined distinctly, making each element stand out against the background. This style is typical of cartoon illustrations where strong outlines help in emphasizing the forms and structures.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a vibrant color palette. The sky is a bright blue with fluffy white clouds, the clock tower has a warm golden hue, and the greenery around it is lush and vivid.

      "question": "Are the textures in the image simplified yet sufficient to identify the clock tower and its surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textures in Image B are indeed simplified. For instance, the clock tower lacks detailed stonework but still retains enough visual cues—like its shape, arches, and clock faces—to be easily recognized as a clock tower. Similarly, the trees and road have basic patterns that suffice for identification without intricate details.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the stylized nature of Image B, key features of the clock tower like its tall structure, clock faces on multiple sides, and arched openings at the base are clearly visible. These elements are crucial for recognizing it as a clock tower and have been maintained in the illustration.",
