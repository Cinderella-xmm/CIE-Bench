    "Question": "Q1: Does the image exhibit soft brushstrokes characteristic of Studio Ghibli's art style?",
    "explanation": "The image in question has clean, defined lines and a digital illustration style rather than soft brushstrokes. Studio Ghibli is known for its hand-drawn animation with visible brushstrokes that give a painterly effect. The image here lacks those painterly textures and instead appears more like a vector or digitally rendered artwork.",
