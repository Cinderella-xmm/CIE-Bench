      "question": "Is the ceiling fan enclosed within a transparent snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling fan is clearly visible inside a transparent spherical object that resembles a snow globe. The visual cues include the rounded shape of the enclosure and its transparency, which allows the fan to be seen clearly. Additionally, the base of the sphere suggests it is designed as a snow globe. This conclusion is drawn from combining the visual information with common knowledge about snow globes.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe rest atop a tabletop under soft lighting with a warm and minimalist background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the snow globe resting on what appears to be a tabletop. The lighting in the image is soft and warm, creating a cozy ambiance. The background is minimalist, featuring neutral tones that do not distract from the main subject. This analysis is based on observing the surface under the snow globe and the overall lighting and background characteristics.",

      "question": "Are there delicate shimmering effects visible on nearby surfaces caused by light passing through the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no visible shimmering effects on nearby surfaces caused by light passing through the snow globe. The lighting is soft and even, but it does not create any noticeable reflections or shimmers on the surrounding area. This conclusion is reached by carefully analyzing the lighting and reflection patterns in the image.",

      "question": "Is the fan inside the snow globe depicted in a playful, cartoon-style 3D design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fan inside the snow globe in Image B is depicted in a realistic manner rather than a playful, cartoon-style 3D design. The proportions and details of the fan resemble those of a real ceiling fan, maintaining a sense of realism. This assessment is made by comparing the design and style of the fan with typical representations of ceiling fans.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the snow globe in Image B, there are small white particles that resemble snowflakes gently drifting through the air. These particles add to the wintry theme of the snow globe and enhance the illusion of a tiny room within. This observation is based on identifying these particles and their movement-like appearance within the enclosed space.",
