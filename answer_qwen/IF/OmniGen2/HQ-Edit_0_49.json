      "question": "Is the teapot enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is clearly surrounded by a transparent structure that appears to be a glass dome. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues of the smooth, curved surface around the teapot and the way light interacts with this surface, suggesting transparency. The dome's presence is further supported by the reflection and refraction effects visible on its surface.",

      "question": "Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the teapot resting on a circular platform that exhibits reflective properties. This is evident from the clear reflections of the teapot and surrounding objects on the surface of the platform. The reflective nature of the base is consistent with a mirrored material.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small porcelain cups arranged in a circle around the base of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are several small objects positioned around the base of the teapot on the same platform. These objects have the appearance of small cups, likely made of porcelain, given their glossy finish and typical cup shape. They are arranged in a circular pattern around the teapot.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there additional tiny, detailed engravings visible on the elevated surfaces of the teapot, amplifying its existing patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual information in Image B, there are no noticeable additional engravings on the elevated surfaces of the teapot beyond its existing intricate patterns. The teapot's design remains consistent with its original ornate detailing without any apparent new engravings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible faux steam spirals rising upward from the teapot, forming curved, wispy trails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are white, wavy lines above the teapot that resemble steam. These lines are stylized and do not appear as natural steam but rather as artistic representations of steam, forming curved and wispy trails. This suggests they are faux steam added for visual effect.",
