      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a minimalist kitchen setting with a steaming cup of coffee as the focal point. The addition of the words 'Warm' and 'Start' enhances the theme without cluttering the image. The overall aesthetic is uncluttered and visually appealing, which aligns well with a morning coffee brand ad. Comparing this with Image A, the original image already had a clean look, and the edits in Image B complement it effectively.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Warm' uses a bold white font on an orange background, creating a strong yet simple contrast. 'Start' is written in a flowing white cursive font, adding a touch of elegance. Both choices are visually harmonious with the clean and inviting tone of the image. When compared to Image A, these additions enhance the simplicity rather than detract from it.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The placement of 'Warm' at the top left and 'Start' at the bottom right creates a balanced composition that guides the viewer's eye across the image. The choice of fonts and colors complements the warm and inviting atmosphere typically associated with morning coffee. Compared to Image A, these elements add thematic relevance without disrupting the serene mood.",
