    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the robot now a miniature 3D articulated model instead of a full-sized giant robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot appears significantly smaller and is placed within a display case, which suggests it is a miniature model. The proportions relative to the surrounding elements (like the base and landscape) indicate that it is not full-sized. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues of its size in relation to the display case and the detailed but small-scale environment around it.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the robot enclosed within a circular display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the robot enclosed within a transparent circular structure that resembles a display case. This is evident from the curved glass-like material surrounding the robot and the reflection on its surface, which are typical features of a display case designed to protect and showcase items.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible tiny gears under transparent panels on the robot’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no visible tiny gears under transparent panels on the robot’s surface. The robot's design is smooth with no such intricate details apparent. The absence of these features is clear from the overall appearance of the robot's exterior.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the display positioned on a hexagonal black base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display in Image B is indeed positioned on a base that has a hexagonal shape and is black in color. This can be determined by observing the outline and structure of the base, which has six distinct sides forming a hexagon.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the robot’s model number etched in a luminous silver font on the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no luminous silver font etched on the base in Image B. Instead, the base features blue illuminated text and symbols, which contrasts with the description of a luminous silver font. This observation is based on the visible colors and style of the text on the base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a miniaturized landscape around the display that reflects the original scene’s elements (e.g., trees, terrain, distant city)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a miniaturized landscape around the display that mimics elements like trees and terrain seen in Image A. This is evident from the small-scale greenery and ground texture surrounding the robot within the display case, reflecting the original scene’s environmental elements in a scaled-down form.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
