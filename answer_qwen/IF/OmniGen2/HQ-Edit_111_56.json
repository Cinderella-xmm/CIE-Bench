      "question": "Is the ballerina depicted as a stone sculpture rather than a living person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is depicted with a smooth, monochromatic surface and lacks the skin texture and coloration typical of a living person. The material appears to be stone or marble, which is characteristic of sculptures rather than living beings. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues such as the uniform color, lack of shadows that would indicate fabric or skin, and the overall rigid posture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ballerina's garments replaced with intricately folded, draping robes characteristic of classical Greek attire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is wearing garments that resemble classical Greek attire, with intricately folded and draping robes. These garments are distinct from ballet costumes and align with the style of ancient Greek clothing. The analysis is based on the visible folds, the way the fabric drapes over the body, and the absence of modern ballet elements like tutus or leotards.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figure wear a stylized laurel wreath on her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B has a wreath on her head, which appears to be made of leaves, resembling a laurel wreath. This type of adornment is historically associated with ancient Greece and Rome, symbolizing victory or honor. The presence of this wreath is evident from its shape and placement on the figure's head.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the figure maintaining the same ballet pose (on pointe, arms extended) as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the pose in Image B with what might be expected in Image A (a ballerina), the figure in Image B is not on pointe nor does it have arms extended in a ballet pose. Instead, the stance is more relaxed and natural, consistent with a classical sculpture. The comparison is based on the positioning of the feet and arms, which do not match the typical ballet stance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the figureâ€™s surface display a marble-like texture with visible chisel marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the figure in Image B displays characteristics of a marble-like texture, including subtle variations in shading that suggest chisel marks. These marks are indicative of sculptural techniques used in creating stone statues. The texture is analyzed by observing the light reflections and shadow patterns on the figure's surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Are there Ionic columns present in the background of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B includes columns that appear to be Ionic in style, identifiable by their slender proportions and scroll-like capitals. This architectural detail is consistent with classical Greek design. The analysis is based on the visual features of the columns and their alignment with known Ionic column characteristics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the floor beneath the figure composed of a mosaic pattern made of small colored tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor beneath the figure in Image B is composed of a mosaic pattern made of small colored tiles. This can be determined by observing the intricate geometric designs and the variety of colors present in the flooring, which are typical of mosaic art found in historical settings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the scene include only historically accurate elements consistent with an ancient Greek temple setting, without modern or out-of-place objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All elements in Image B, including the figure's attire, the laurel wreath, the Ionic columns, and the mosaic floor, are consistent with an ancient Greek temple setting. There are no modern or out-of-place objects visible, suggesting that the scene is historically accurate within the context of ancient Greece.",
