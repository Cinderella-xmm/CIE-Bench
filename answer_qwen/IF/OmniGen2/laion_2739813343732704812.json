      "question": "Is the pelican rendered in a cartoon-style with simplified and exaggerated features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pelican in Image B is clearly rendered with a cartoon-style aesthetic. The features are simplified and exaggerated, such as the large eyes, bright colors, and the addition of a sailor hat. This style is typical for cartoons, which often use such elements to create a playful and appealing character.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the pelican’s beak been visibly exaggerated in size or shape compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's beak appears larger and more vibrant in color compared to what would typically be seen in a realistic depiction. The exaggerated size and shape contribute to the cartoonish nature of the image. Comparing this with Image A, where the beak is proportionate and naturalistic, it is evident that the beak in Image B has been visibly exaggerated.",

      "question": "Do the pelican’s eyes appear noticeably bulging and enlarged for comedic effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pelican’s eyes in Image B are noticeably bulging and enlarged, which is a common technique in cartoons to add expressiveness and appeal. This contrasts with Image A, where the eyes are smaller and more realistically proportioned. The enlargement here serves a comedic and engaging effect typical of cartoon art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pelican’s feathers colored in vivid pastel shades such as soft pinks, blues, or lavenders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The feathers in Image B are colored in vivid pastel shades, predominantly soft blues. This choice of coloration is not typical for real pelicans but is commonly used in cartoons to make characters visually striking and appealing. In contrast, Image A shows naturalistic feather colors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the colors of the feathers have changed in Image B, the texture still resembles the detailed feather patterns seen in Image A. The preservation of texture details even with color changes suggests an effort to maintain some realism within the cartoon style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a sailor hat on the pelican’s head, which is not present in Image A. The hat adds to the whimsical and nautical theme of the cartoon rendering. Its presence is a clear indicator of an edited or stylized version of the original.",
      "weight": 1,
