      "question": "Does the edited version retain the original photo subjects (polar bear and cubs in an icy setting)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image clearly shows a polar bear with two cubs situated on an icy surface, which is consistent with the natural habitat of polar bears. The visual cues such as the white fur of the bears and the icy environment are evident. There is no indication that the subjects have been altered or replaced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the color tone of the image been slightly cooled to include more blue and white hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the color palette in the edited image, there is a dominance of blue and white hues, which aligns with the icy and cold environment typical of polar bear habitats. This slight cooling effect enhances the perception of a cold climate, which is logical for representing an Arctic scene.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a bold headline reading “Only Ice Left. Nowhere to Go.” located in the top right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the top right corner of the edited image, there is indeed text present. However, the bold headline reads 'CLIMATE CRISIS' rather than 'Only Ice Left. Nowhere to Go.'. Therefore, the specific phrase mentioned in the question is not located in the described position.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of the edited image, there are visible elements that resemble logos and text, which appear to be associated with organizations or websites. These elements suggest the inclusion of branding or informational content related to the message of the poster.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains a realistic depiction of the polar bears and their environment without any cartoonish or exaggerated features. The style appears serious and is designed to convey a message about climate change, which supports a realistic approach.",
