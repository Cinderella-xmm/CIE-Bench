      "question": "Is the silhouetted boat and riders replaced by a mythical ocean guardian creature that is clearly distinguishable from a regular boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object near the center of the lower half is not a regular boat but a large, fantastical structure resembling a shell with spires. It is clearly distinguishable from a typical boat due to its size, shape, and glowing features. The riders on the jet ski remain unchanged and are separate from this structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B has a shell-like body that emits a bright blue light rather than sunset-colored hues. The colors orange, red, and yellow are present in the sky during the sunset but not as part of the creature's body.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B does have structures extending from its back that resemble coral-like spires. These spires are brightly colored and stand out against the background, indicating they are an intentional design feature of the mythical creature.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water trail behind the jet ski in Image B remains consistent with a typical water trail and has not been replaced with glowing, wave-like patterns. The water reflects the colors of the sunset but does not form distinct glowing patterns.",
