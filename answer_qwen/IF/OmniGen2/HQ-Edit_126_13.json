        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear presence of annotated lines and minimalist icons surrounding the tea set.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains four minimalist icons that correspond to different stages: tea leaves harvested, boiling water poured, sipping for mindfulness, and blossoms symbolizing tranquility.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The diagram elements in Image B do incorporate soft pastel green hues.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, all original objects—the teapot, cup, chopsticks, vase with cherry blossoms, and patterned mats—are present in Image B. However, their appearances have been slightly altered to fit the infographic style, such as the teapot and cup being rendered in a solid green color. Their positions remain largely unchanged, though.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added diagram in Image B does not overlap or obscure any of the original table elements. It flows naturally around them, utilizing the space effectively without interfering with the visibility of the teapot, cup, chopsticks, vase, or mats. This careful placement ensures that both the original scene and the new information are clearly presented.",
