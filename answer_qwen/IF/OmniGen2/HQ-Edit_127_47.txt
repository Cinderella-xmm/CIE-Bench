    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "In Image B, the forest lake scene is clearly visible within a spherical glass orb. The edges of the sphere are distinct and enclose the entire landscape, including trees, water, and animals. This conclusion is drawn from observing the curvature of the horizon line and the way light refracts through the transparent material of the orb.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "The ducks in Image B appear to have a glossy, reflective surface finish typical of 3D models. Their surfaces reflect light and surrounding elements, which is not characteristic of real-life ducks. This analysis is based on the visual cues of light reflection and the smooth texture observed on the ducks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "The water in Image B does feature layered resin-like textures and transparent materials that enhance depth and clarity. This can be inferred from the way the water appears to have multiple layers with varying transparency and how it interacts with light, giving a sense of depth that mimics resin or similar materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:"
    "explanation": "There are no visible miniature figurines of woodland animals among the rocks and vegetation in Image B. The scene includes only the ducks and some natural elements like rocks and plants, but no additional animal figures can be seen.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:"
    "explanation": "The glass orb in Image B is indeed resting on a natural wood base. The base exhibits organic textures such as grain patterns and bark-like features, which are characteristic of natural wood. This conclusion is based on the visual inspection of the base's surface and its natural appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
