    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image showing a single, continuous serpent-shaped creature composed of the beads instead of loose or clustered beads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a single, continuous form that resembles a serpent. The beads are arranged in a way that they follow the curvature of the serpent's body, creating a seamless and continuous appearance rather than appearing as loose or clustered beads. This conclusion is drawn by observing the uniformity and alignment of the beads along the shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red and yellow patterns used to create a scaly texture along the body of the serpent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red and yellow patterns on the serpent's body appear to mimic a scaly texture. These colors are distributed in a manner that suggests overlapping scales, which is typical for reptilian skin. The visual cues of alternating red and yellow segments contribute to this interpretation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the serpent have two blue circular features positioned as eyes at its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the head of the serpent, there are two prominent blue circular features positioned where eyes would typically be located. These features stand out due to their color contrast with the surrounding red and yellow patterns, suggesting they represent eyes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the black motifs arranged as detailed, tribal-style patterns along the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black motifs along the serpent’s body are intricate and resemble tribal-style patterns. They are evenly spaced and detailed, adding complexity to the design. The arrangement and style of these motifs align with common characteristics of tribal art.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail of the serpent extends into a long, thin form with small bead-like tips at the end. These tips are consistent with the overall design and add a sense of movement and detail to the tail, enhancing the realism of the serpent.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent is composed primarily of red, yellow, blue, and black colors. There are no additional or unrelated colors introduced in the design. The consistency in color usage maintains the thematic unity of the artwork.",
