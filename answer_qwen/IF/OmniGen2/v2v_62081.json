      "question": "Has the portrait been reimagined in a dynamic Xieyi style Chinese ink wash painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B suggest that the portrait is not rendered in the Xieyi style of Chinese ink wash painting. The lines and colors are smooth and detailed, lacking the spontaneous and expressive brushstrokes characteristic of Xieyi. Instead, the image appears to be a more refined and realistic illustration with careful attention to detail in the hair, clothing, and facial features.",

      "question": "Are the texture of the dark hair and the form of the blue coat conveyed using bold, spontaneous black ink strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark hair and blue coat are depicted with smooth, controlled lines and shading rather than bold, spontaneous black ink strokes. The texture and form are achieved through meticulous detailing and color blending, which is inconsistent with the typical characteristics of spontaneous ink strokes used in traditional Chinese ink wash paintings.",

      "question": "Are the facial features and cravat articulated using softer, graded grey washes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features and cravat in Image B are illustrated with clear, defined lines and soft shading. While there is some use of gradation for depth and shadow, it does not appear as graded grey washes typically seen in watercolor or ink wash techniques. The rendering is more precise and less fluid than what would be expected from grey washes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the portrait captured on a subtly textured, antique white paper ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the portrait against a plain, untextured background that appears to be a neutral beige or light brown color. There is no visible texture that would suggest an antique white paper ground. The background is smooth and even, indicating a digital or printed surface rather than a textured paper medium.",

      "question": "Has the patterned wooden frame been simplified into a series of suggestive, darker ink outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame surrounding the portrait is a simple, solid border with no intricate patterns or textures that would resemble a wooden frame. It lacks any suggestion of being composed of darker ink outlines. Instead, it appears as a clean, uniform border, which contrasts with the complex wood grain patterns seen in Image A.",
