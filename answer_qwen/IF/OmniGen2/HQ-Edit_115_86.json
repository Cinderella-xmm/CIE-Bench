      "question": "Is the ballerina depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated proportions and a significantly larger or more voluminous tutu than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina is depicted with a stylized and simplified form typical of cartoon illustrations. The tutu appears more voluminous and less detailed compared to realistic depictions, which often show more texture and natural folds. This suggests an exaggerated style aimed at enhancing visual appeal in a cartoon context. Comparing this with Image A, where the tutu has a more realistic volume and detail, confirms that Image B indeed features a larger and more voluminous tutu.",

      "question": "Is the background of the image composed of soft pastel shades such as light pink, lavender, or mint green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a background consisting of soft pastel shades, specifically light pink. This choice of color is common in designs aiming for a gentle, elegant, or child-friendly aesthetic, which aligns well with the theme of ballet. There are no other colors like lavender or mint green present, but the presence of light pink alone satisfies the criteria.",

      "question": "Are there visible glitter accents (such as sparkling dots or shimmering patterns) added to the ballerinaâ€™s costume?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are visible glitter accents on the ballerina's costume, particularly noticeable as sparkling dots along the edges of the tutu and bodice. These details add a shimmering effect, enhancing the visual appeal and fitting the whimsical nature of the illustration. In contrast, Image A does not exhibit such glitter effects, indicating they were added in the edited version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a clearly designated blank area in the bottom right section, framed similarly to the other sections containing the ballerina.

      "explanation": "Floral motifs, including flowers and leaves, are present along the borders of the image in Image B. These decorations are strategically placed in the corners of the frames, adding an ornamental touch that complements the overall design. This type of embellishment is frequently used in artistic compositions to enhance visual interest and thematic consistency.",
