    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The animal in Image B appears to be composed of small, distinct ceramic tiles. This is evident from the visible grid-like pattern on its surface, which suggests that each tile is a separate piece. The uniformity and alignment of these tiles indicate they are arranged to form the body of the animal. World knowledge about mosaics supports this observation, as mosaics typically consist of small pieces of material like ceramic tiles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The stripes on the animal in Image B are indeed made from glossy ceramic tiles in vibrant orange and deep black. The glossy finish is apparent due to the reflective quality of the tiles, and the colors are vivid and distinct. The use of ceramic tiles for such a design aligns with common practices in mosaic art, where bright and contrasting colors are often used to create striking patterns.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The eyes and snout of the animal in Image B seem to be formed from precisely cut ceramic tiles. The eyes have a clear, defined shape with white and black sections that mimic the appearance of real eyes. The snout also has a smooth, rounded form typical of ceramic tiles. These features maintain an expressive appearance, suggesting careful craftsmanship in cutting and arranging the tiles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The mosaic animal in Image B is positioned on a surface that exhibits a sandy texture. The granular appearance of the platform beneath the animal is consistent with sand, which is a common material for outdoor settings or decorative displays. The contrast between the smooth tiles and the rough sand further emphasizes the texture difference.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "There is a clear visual contrast between the smooth, glossy surface of the tiles on the animal and the rough, granular texture of the sandy platform in Image B. The tiles reflect light smoothly, while the sand absorbs it, creating a noticeable difference in texture. This contrast enhances the three-dimensional effect of the mosaic and highlights the materials used.",
    "answer": "Yes"
