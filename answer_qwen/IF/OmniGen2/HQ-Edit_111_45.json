      "question": "Is the entire scene rendered in a flat, stylized manner consistent with a medieval illuminated manuscript, including use of gold highlights and non-realistic proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B is rendered with a flat, stylized aesthetic that aligns with medieval illuminated manuscripts. The use of gold highlights on the figure's clothing and the background elements, along with the non-realistic proportions of the objects and characters, supports this observation. The overall composition lacks depth and shadowing typical of realistic renderings, further emphasizing its stylized nature.",
