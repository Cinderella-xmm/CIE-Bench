      "question": "Are there five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls representing the individual?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed five objects that resemble Russian nesting dolls. They have a chibi-style design with exaggerated features like large eyes and small bodies, which is typical of such artistic representations.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls sized from biggest to smallest in a progressive manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the nesting dolls in Image B, they are arranged in a row where each subsequent doll is visibly smaller than the one before it. This progressive sizing is characteristic of traditional Russian nesting dolls, confirming the arrangement described in the question.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B do not display any specific attire or stance that would correspond to an individual's clothing or posture. Nesting dolls typically have a generic design and do not replicate detailed personal characteristics such as attire or stance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are clearly placed in a neat row on a wooden surface adjacent to a television. The orderly placement and proximity to the TV match the description provided in the question.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain an aspect ratio of 3:2?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the aspect ratio, one would need to measure the width and height of Image B. However, based on visual inspection alone, the image appears square-like rather than adhering to a 3:2 ratio, which is more rectangular. Without precise measurements, the assumption leans towards a non-3:2 ratio.",
