      "question": "Is the image rendered in a stylized, graphic manner consistent with Art Deco design principles, rather than a photorealistic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image exhibits strong characteristics of stylized graphic design, including bold outlines, simplified forms, and a flat color application with minimal shading. These are hallmark features of Art Deco, which emphasizes geometric patterns, symmetry, and decorative elements over realism. The use of clean lines, contrasting colors, and stylized natural forms (such as the wave and palm tree) aligns closely with Art Deco aesthetics. Unlike photorealism, which aims to replicate real-world textures and lighting, this image uses abstraction and simplification to convey mood and form. Therefore, based on visual cues and knowledge of Art Deco design principles, the rendering is clearly stylized and not photorealistic.",

      "question": "Are the ocean waves represented using bold, simplified geometric curves instead of naturalistic wave forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ocean wave in the image is depicted with a large, sweeping curve composed of layered, concentric arcs in varying shades of blue and white. This form is highly abstracted and lacks the irregular, chaotic motion typical of real ocean waves. Instead, it uses smooth, repeating geometric shapes to suggest movement and volume. This approach is characteristic of graphic design where natural phenomena are simplified into idealized forms for visual impact. In contrast, naturalistic wave forms would show more variation in crest shape, foam distribution, and texture. Thus, the wave here is clearly stylized with geometric curves.",

      "question": "Are the palm trees depicted as stylized vertical lines without detailed fronds or natural tree structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm tree in the image is rendered with a long, straight trunk and a crown of fronds that are simplified into broad, angular shapes. While the fronds are present, they are not detailed or realistic—they are stylized into sharp, symmetrical leaf-like forms. However, they are not mere vertical lines; the tree retains a recognizable silhouette and structural hierarchy. The trunk is clearly defined, and the fronds have distinct shapes, albeit abstracted. Therefore, while stylized, the tree does include some representation of fronds and structure, so it cannot be described as 'without detailed fronds or natural tree structure' entirely.",

      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky rendered as symmetrical, geometric shapes rather than natural cloud forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds in the image are depicted as simple, rounded, and symmetrical masses with clean edges and uniform coloration. They lack the soft, diffuse, and irregular textures typical of real clouds. Instead, they resemble simplified cartoon or graphic representations—common in stylized art. Their placement and form follow a balanced, almost decorative arrangement, consistent with graphic design principles. This contrasts with natural cloud forms, which are amorphous and dynamic. Hence, the clouds are clearly rendered as geometric, stylized shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image use a color palette dominated by muted greens, blues, and warm oranges, avoiding bright or highly saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color scheme includes various shades of green (for the sky), deep and medium blues (for the ocean), and warm orange tones (for the sun and sunset). These colors are relatively subdued compared to vibrant or neon hues. The overall tone is harmonious and earthy, with no overly bright or fluorescent elements. The use of flat color blocks without heavy saturation supports a calm, retro aesthetic. While the colors are not dull, they are balanced and not hyper-saturated, fitting within a muted, vintage-inspired palette. This choice aligns with mid-century modern and Art Deco influences, which often favor rich but controlled color palettes.",

      "question": "Are the essential elements of the beach scene—sand, ocean, horizon, and sky—still present and recognizable despite the stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the stylized nature of the artwork, all core components of a beach scene are clearly identifiable. The sand is represented by a light tan area at the bottom right, the ocean by the dominant wave and water surface, the horizon line is visible between the sea and sky, and the sky occupies the upper portion with the sun and clouds. Although abstracted, these elements maintain their symbolic and spatial relationships, allowing viewers to immediately recognize the scene as a beach at sunset. Stylization does not obscure meaning—it enhances it through iconic representation. Therefore, the key elements remain both present and recognizable.",
