    "Question": "Q1: Is the mirror still present in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no reflective surface that would indicate the presence of a mirror. Instead, the area where a mirror might typically be located has been replaced with a different object. Based on this observation and common sense, it can be concluded that the mirror is not present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Has the area previously occupied by the mirror been replaced with a minimalist landscape wall art?",
    "explanation": "The region above the sink now features an object with a simplistic design depicting green hills and a tree against a neutral background. This matches the description of minimalist landscape wall art. The analysis is based on visual cues such as the shape, color, and content of the object in that specific location.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the minimalist landscape wall art appear to have a fabric canvas material texture?",
    "explanation": "The surface of the wall art in Image B appears to have a subtle texture that resembles fabric canvas. This conclusion is drawn from the visible graininess and lack of smoothness typical of painted or printed surfaces on fabric. Common knowledge about wall art materials supports this observation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Have any other parts of the bathroom, such as the sink, vase, lights, or tiles, been altered unintentionally?",
