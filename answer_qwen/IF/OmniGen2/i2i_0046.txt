{
    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The image is clearly surrounded by a white border, which can be observed as a distinct frame around the central content. This type of border is commonly used in photo prints or digital edits to give an aesthetic look similar to traditional photographs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "At the bottom of the image, within the white border, there is a caption that reads '11:13 AM'. This text is positioned centrally and contrasts with the background, making it easily visible and legible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The entire image appears to have a faded effect applied, reducing its overall contrast and saturation. This gives the image a vintage or aged appearance, consistent with the style often seen in retro photography or edited images meant to evoke nostalgia.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection, the image exhibits a subtle grainy texture throughout, resembling the surface of paper. This texture adds to the vintage feel and suggests that a filter or editing technique has been used to simulate the look of an old photograph printed on textured paper.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "Comparing the composition and elements of the edited image (Image B) with the original image (Image A), the core subject—a person skateboarding—and the surrounding environment remain unchanged. The only differences are the added white border, the caption, the faded effect, and the grain texture, which do not alter the fundamental composition or elements of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
