      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the body of the teapot retains its original rounded and ornate design with intricate dragon engravings. There is no indication of a transformation into a sleek cylindrical shape. The analysis is based on observing the overall shape and contours of the teapot, which clearly show a traditional and decorative form rather than a modern cylindrical one.",

      "question": "Are the dragon engravings still present and visibly detailed on the body of the canister?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon engravings are clearly visible and detailed on the body of the teapot. The dragons appear to be intricately carved with scales, claws, and flowing lines that suggest movement. This observation is made by closely examining the surface texture and patterns on the teapot's body, which align with common artistic representations of dragons in traditional designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a lid that appears to have a hinged mechanism, as indicated by the visible hinge at the top and the ornate knob on the lid. There is no evidence of a metallic screw cap replacing the original lid. The comparison with Image A confirms that the lid maintains its original design, suggesting no replacement has occurred.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there is no metallic screw cap present on the teapot in Image B, it is not possible for there to be intricate tea leaf patterns embossed around its circumference. The lid remains a hinged design with no signs of a screw cap or any embossed patterns related to tea leaves.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible inscription of the text 'Dragon's Delight' along the length of the spout in Image B. The spout maintains its original design without any textual additions. Comparing with Image A, the spout remains unchanged, indicating no new inscriptions have been added.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As there is no screw cap present on the teapot in Image B, it is impossible for there to be a minimalist tea leaf logo on it. The lid is a hinged design, and there are no logos or symbols resembling a tea leaf on its top center. The comparison with Image A further confirms the absence of such a logo.",
