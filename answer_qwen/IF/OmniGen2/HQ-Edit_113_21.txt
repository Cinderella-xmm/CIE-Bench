    "Question": "Q5: Do all three postcards feature vivid colors and geometric borders?",
    "explanation": "Each of the three panels uses vibrant and vivid colors, typical of African-inspired art. However, only the central panel has a solid geometric border (a teal rectangle), while the other two panels do not have such borders. Thus, it cannot be said that all three postcards feature geometric borders.",
