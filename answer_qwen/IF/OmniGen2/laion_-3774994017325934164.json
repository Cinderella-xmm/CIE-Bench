      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The individual in Image B has been rendered with exaggerated and stylized features typical of cartoon characters, such as a simplified face, bright colors, and bold outlines.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's head appears disproportionately large compared to the body, which is a common technique in cartoons to emphasize facial expressions and create a playful appearance.
