      "question": "Is the dog depicted as a plush stuffed animal with soft, fabric-like texture and visible seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B appears to be a plush stuffed animal with a soft, fabric-like texture.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush dog has white fur but lacks any sandy-colored spots. It is uniformly white, which differs from what might be expected if it retained the same pattern as an original image with such spots.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The harness on the plush dog in Image B has been replaced with a corset that features visible crystal-like embellishments.
