    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all spheres and cubes replaced with LEGO brick shapes that retain the original marbled patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects are clearly identifiable as LEGO bricks based on their shape and interlocking features. The marbled patterns from the original spheres and cubes appear to be preserved on these LEGO bricks. This conclusion is drawn by observing the distinct LEGO design elements combined with the familiar marbled textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do all LEGO bricks have a matte surface texture without reflective highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO bricks in Image B exhibit reflective highlights, indicating a glossy or shiny surface rather than a matte one. This can be inferred from the visible light reflections on the surfaces of the bricks, which suggest a non-matte finish.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks arranged in an orderly, structured pattern on a wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO bricks in Image B are placed on what appears to be a wooden shelf, but they are not arranged in a strictly orderly or structured pattern. Some bricks are stacked while others are scattered, suggesting a more casual arrangement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks display subtle interlocking details such as studs or recessed connectors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO bricks in Image B show clear interlocking details typical of LEGO designs, including studs on top and recessed connectors underneath. These features are essential for LEGO bricks to connect with each other, and they are visibly present in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a wooden panel with a consistent texture and color, which gives it a clean and uniform appearance. There are no additional elements or distractions in the background, supporting a minimalist style.",
