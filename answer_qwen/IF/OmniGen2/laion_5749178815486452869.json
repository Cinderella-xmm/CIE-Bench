      "question": "Is the green field depicted as a floating island disconnected from any ground or horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green field is clearly depicted as a floating island with no visible connection to any ground or horizon. The edges of the island are sharply defined against the sky, and there is no indication of it being part of a larger landmass. This conclusion is drawn from observing the visual cues of the island's edges and its placement in the sky.",

      "question": "Are the yellow and red flowers significantly more vibrant and saturated in color compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The yellow and red flowers in Image B appear vibrant and saturated. Comparing this with Image A, where the flowers also have bright colors but seem more naturalistic, the flowers in Image B exhibit an enhanced vibrancy that suggests increased saturation. This analysis is based on comparing the color intensity and contrast between the two images.",

      "question": "Has the moon been replaced with an oversized apple in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed an oversized apple positioned prominently in the sky, replacing what would typically be a moon or another celestial body. This is evident by the apple's size relative to other elements and its placement in the night sky. The reasoning involves recognizing the unusual presence of an apple in a location where one would expect a moon.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the bee and butterfly been replaced with stylized, playful, non-realistic motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain bees or butterflies; instead, it features stylized, playful motifs such as the oversized apple and geometric structures. These elements are non-realistic compared to the realistic depiction of insects in Image A. The comparison highlights the shift from naturalistic to whimsical design elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the tree been replaced with a hollow geometric structure (e.g., cube, pyramid, or sphere) with visible interior or transparent parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree from Image A has been replaced with a hollow geometric structure resembling a small house or gazebo with visible interior parts. This change is apparent when comparing the solid, natural form of the tree in Image A to the structured, transparent appearance of the object in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the starry night sky with visible stars and cosmic depth still present and dominant in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The starry night sky remains a dominant feature in Image B, with visible stars and cosmic depth similar to Image A. The continuity of this element across both images indicates that the background retains its primary characteristics despite other changes in the scene.",
