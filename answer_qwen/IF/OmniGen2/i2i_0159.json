      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a blue circular object in the air near the dog's head. This object has a flat and smooth surface typical of a flying disc rather than the textured surface of a tennis ball. The color and shape are consistent with common flying discs used for play. Therefore, it can be concluded that the yellow tennis ball has indeed been replaced.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is wearing a blue bow tie around its neck. This accessory was not present in Image A, where the dog had a red collar. The addition of the blue bow tie is clearly visible and distinct from the original collar.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image retains the playful and lively atmosphere of the original. The dog's expression and posture remain joyful and energetic. The addition of the flying disc and the blue bow tie adds a new element of fun without detracting from the overall vitality. The scene still conveys a sense of movement and enjoyment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, the flying disc in Image B is located in a similar position relative to the dog as the tennis ball in Image A. Both objects are airborne and close to the dog's head, suggesting continuity in the action captured. The positioning supports the idea that the dog is engaged in a similar playful activity.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the flying disc and the blue bow tie collar in Image B appear as intended. The flying disc maintains a realistic shape and color, and the bow tie fits naturally on the dog's neck without any visual anomalies. There are no signs of distortion or inconsistency that would suggest unintended alterations.",
