      "question": "Is there a clear glass dome covering the entire scene, enclosing the house, lake, and surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene is visibly enclosed within a transparent glass dome. The dome's reflective and refractive properties are evident as it captures light and reflections from its surroundings. This suggests that the scene is designed to be a miniature diorama or terrarium, which typically uses such domes for protection and display purposes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows pathways covered with what appears to be mossy green material. These pathways lead toward and around the house, providing a naturalistic look. The texture and color of the pathways resemble moss commonly used in miniature landscaping to simulate grass or ground cover.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are indeed multiple tiny shrubs placed around the house and along the pathways. These shrubs add detail and realism to the scene, mimicking a well-maintained garden environment. Their placement enhances the aesthetic appeal and complements the overall design of the miniature landscape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lake in Image B has a shiny, reflective surface that resembles water but does not appear silver-colored. Instead, it reflects light and surrounding elements, giving it a realistic water-like appearance. Therefore, while the lake is present and shiny, it does not match the description of being silver-colored.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, delicate fairy lights can be seen wrapped around the miniature trees and foliage. These lights add a magical and enchanting quality to the scene, enhancing its visual appeal. The presence of these lights is consistent with common practices in creating detailed and atmospheric miniature displays.",

The bridge is a wooden structure with railings, positioned in a way that it serves as a functional and decorative element linking the two sides of the scene. Its presence contributes to the narrative and accessibility within the miniature setting.",
