      "question": "Does the figurine maintain the skier's exact pose from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is depicted in a skiing stance with bent knees and arms extended backward holding ski poles. This posture suggests an active skiing motion. Comparing this to Image A, the skier also has a similar posture with bent knees and arms extended backward. The analysis of both images shows that the key elements of the pose are preserved in the figurine.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an additional pair of skis placed beside the figurine, which implies that the skis can be detached from the figurine. This design choice allows for interchangeable or removable skis, suggesting flexibility in the figurine's setup.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible indication in Image B of a magnetic snow powder base attached to the figurine. The figurine appears to be standing on the snow without any additional base structure. Therefore, based on the visual cues, it can be concluded that there is no such base present.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any packaging illustrations or additional designs beyond the figurine and the extra pair of skis. The background remains consistent with the snowy mountain scene, indicating that no packaging elements have been added.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B includes ski poles held in each hand, mirroring the skier's pose in Image A. Additionally, the figurine has a visible backpack, which aligns with the skier's gear in the original image. These details suggest that the figurine accurately represents the skier's equipment.",
