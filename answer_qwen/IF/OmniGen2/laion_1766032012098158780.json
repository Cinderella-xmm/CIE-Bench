      "question": "Has the jeans been transformed into a perfume bottle shape that maintains the flared leg silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object clearly resembles a perfume bottle with a shape that mimics flared jeans. The lower part of the bottle maintains the silhouette of flared legs, which is characteristic of bell-bottom jeans. This conclusion is drawn from observing the transition from a narrow waist to wide legs, consistent with the design of flared jeans.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bottle made of transparent glass tinted with denim blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The material of the bottle in Image B appears to be transparent glass, as light seems to pass through it and reflect off its surface. Additionally, the tint of the glass matches the denim blue color typically associated with jeans. This analysis combines visual cues of transparency and color with common knowledge about materials used for perfume bottles.",

      "question": "Have the back pockets been replaced with embossed metallic branding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where back pockets would typically be located on jeans has been replaced with what appears to be embossed metallic branding. This is inferred from the shiny, reflective surface and engraved text visible at the top of the bottle, which contrasts with the matte finish of the rest of the bottle.",

      "question": "Is there a silver button-style cap at the top of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the very top of the bottle in Image B, there is a cap that resembles a silver button. Its circular shape and reflective surface are consistent with the appearance of a metallic button-style cap commonly found on perfume bottles. This observation is based on the visual characteristics of the cap and general knowledge about perfume bottle designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows lace-up details along the sides of the bottle, positioned similarly to where laces would appear on the original jeans. These details include small loops and strings that mimic the look of laces, confirming their presence and alignment with the original design elements.",
