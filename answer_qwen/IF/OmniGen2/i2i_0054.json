      "question": "Is the background changed to a matte solid gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a uniform, untextured gray color throughout the entire frame. There are no variations in hue or saturation that would suggest any other elements or textures. This is consistent with a matte finish, which typically lacks gloss and has a smooth appearance. The absence of any gradients or patterns further supports this conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any visible shadows in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the uniform gray tone does not exhibit any darker areas that could be interpreted as shadows. Shadows are usually indicated by variations in light intensity, but here, the lack of such variations confirms the absence of shadows.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the banana shape and metal stand curves highlighted effectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists solely of a solid gray color without any shapes, lines, or objects. Therefore, it cannot contain a banana shape or a metal stand, nor can it highlight any curves. This question assumes the presence of elements that are not present in the image.",

      "question": "Does the image maintain a minimalistic design without unnecessary elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is entirely filled with a single, solid gray color. It contains no additional elements, textures, or details. This simplicity aligns perfectly with the principles of minimalistic design, which emphasizes the use of only essential components.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "Given that Image B is a plain, solid gray with no additional features or distractions, it adheres to the core tenets of minimalism. Minimalistic design assets are characterized by their simplicity and focus on essential elements, both of which are evident in this image.",
