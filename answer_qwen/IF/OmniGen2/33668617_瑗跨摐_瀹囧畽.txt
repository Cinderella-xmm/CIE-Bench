    "Question": "Q1: Has the peacock been transformed into a mythical lunar phoenix with a celestial, otherworldly appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the peacock exhibits features that are not typical of a real peacock but rather align with fantastical or mythical creatures. The presence of glowing elements, unusual feather patterns, and an overall ethereal quality suggest a transformation into something more mythical. The combination of these visual cues, along with the dark, starry background, supports the idea of a celestial, otherworldly appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the feathers exhibit a soft, silver-colored glow throughout their surface?",
    "explanation": "The feathers in Image B do not display a uniform silver-colored glow. Instead, they have vibrant blue and green hues with some areas illuminated by light, giving them a luminous quality. This is different from a soft, silver glow, which would imply a metallic sheen across the entire surface.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are there radiant moonstone-like gems positioned at the center of each eye?",

    "Question": "Q5: Has the original crest been replaced with translucent, shard-like selenite crystals?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the crest of the peacock replaced with structures resembling translucent, shard-like crystals.
