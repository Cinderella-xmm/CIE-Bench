    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "By examining the stickers in Image B, it is clear that each sticker has a white border and no visible background elements behind the characters. This suggests that the backgrounds of all stickers are transparent. The absence of any overlapping or background details further supports this conclusion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The stickers in Image B are arranged in a grid format. Counting the rows and columns, there are 3 rows and 4 columns, making it a 3x4 grid rather than a 3x3 grid. Therefore, the arrangement does not match a 3x3 grid.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "Each sticker appears to have a square shape with equal width and height proportions. Observing the edges and comparing them visually confirms that they maintain a 1:1 aspect ratio, which is characteristic of square shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The stickers in Image B depict characters in a Chibi-style, characterized by their large heads, small bodies, and simplified features.

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "Each sticker portrays a distinct action, emotion, or theme related to travel.

These variations suggest different travel-related scenarios or emotions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:",

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7:",

{
    "Question": "Q8:",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q9:",
    "explanation": "There are no texts present within the stickers themselves. The text at the top of Image B is not part of the stickers but rather an external label. Since there are no texts within the stickers, the question of accuracy does not apply.",
