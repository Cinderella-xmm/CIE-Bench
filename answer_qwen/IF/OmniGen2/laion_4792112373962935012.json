      "question": "Is the lime wedge positioned on top of the glass in a way that resembles a smiling cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime wedge is placed on the rim of the glass, angled slightly upward and to the side. While it does not form a literal 'smiling cap,' its position and curvature could be interpreted as part of a playful, anthropomorphic design. However, it does not resemble a cap with a smile; instead, it appears more like a garnish. The term 'smiling cap' implies a shape or arrangement that forms a smile, which is not present here. Based on visual analysis, the lime wedge is simply a decorative element, not styled to mimic a smiling cap.",

      "question": "Are two ice cubes positioned within the glass to resemble eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are multiple ice cubes floating in the drink. Among them, two are clearly positioned near the top of the glass, aligned horizontally and spaced apart, resembling eyes. This is a common cartoon technique used to give inanimate objects facial features. The positioning and size of these ice cubes align with the typical representation of eyes in character designs. Thus, they function as stylized eyes in this whimsical illustration.",

      "question": "Does the sugared rim of the glass form a visible grin-like shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sugared rim in Image B is depicted as a textured, reddish-pink border around the top of the glass. It is not shaped into a grin or curved downward to suggest a smile. Instead, it follows the circular contour of the glass uniformly. A grin-like shape would require an intentional curve or indentation mimicking a mouth. There is no such feature present; therefore, the rim does not form a grin-like shape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large yellow sombrero with a red and white ruffled edge is prominently displayed above the glass. It appears to be resting on top of the glass, giving the impression that it is worn by the anthropomorphized cocktail. The sombrero is clearly visible and stylistically consistent with traditional Mexican hats, reinforcing the festive theme. Its placement suggests it is attached to or part of the character’s head.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two maracas held by black-gloved hands extending from the sides of the glass. These maracas are colorful, striped, and typical of Mexican fiesta imagery. They are positioned as if being played by the character, contributing to the animated, celebratory nature of the design. Their presence and use as props confirm they are accessories to the character.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Scattered throughout the background of Image B are small, multicolored pieces of confetti in various shapes (e.g., triangles, strips). These appear to be falling or floating around the central character, enhancing the festive atmosphere. The colors—pink, green, yellow, and blue—are vibrant and consistent with party decorations. Therefore, confetti is clearly visible and contributes to the celebratory theme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, the phrase 'Fiesta Time!' is written in large, red, bold letters with a white outline and slight shadow effect. The font is playful and rounded, typical of festive or cartoon-style graphics. It is centrally located and dominates the upper portion of the image, making it highly visible and fitting the overall theme. The use of exclamation mark and bright color reinforces the energetic tone.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features exaggerated proportions, anthropomorphic elements (the smiling face on the glass), vibrant colors, and playful accessories like maracas and a sombrero. The background includes confetti and bold typography. These stylistic choices are characteristic of cartoonish, whimsical art commonly used in advertising for fun, festive products like cocktails. The overall composition is designed to evoke joy and celebration, aligning perfectly with a festive cocktail ad poster.",
