      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pocket watch and surrounding objects are clearly enclosed within a transparent glass dome.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a three-dimensional setting that resembles an antique library environment.

      "explanation": "The fabric in Image B does not feature intricate golden embroidery patterns. Instead, it appears to be a plain cloth serving as a base for the glass dome. Comparatively, Image A shows a fabric with detailed embroidery, but since the question focuses solely on Image B, the absence of such patterns here leads to a negative response.",
