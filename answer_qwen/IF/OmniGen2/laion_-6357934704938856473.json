      "question": "Does the robot exhibit a brushed metal and matte finish across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B appears to have a uniform, smooth texture with no visible signs of a brushed metal finish. The surfaces are consistent with a matte or slightly glossy plastic appearance, which is typical for toy packaging images. This conclusion is drawn from observing the light reflection and texture details on the robot's body.",

      "question": "Is the robot displayed inside a hexagonal box labeled \"MECHA VANGUARD\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot is indeed displayed within a box that has a hexagonal window cutout through which the robot is visible. The text 'MECHA VANGUARD' is clearly printed on the lower part of the box. This analysis is based on the shape of the viewing window and the legible text on the packaging.",

      "question": "Are multiple weapons visible, indicating they are replaceable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only one weapon, a gun, is visibly held by the robot. There are no additional weapons shown either in the robot's hands or attached to the box, suggesting that there are no indications of replaceable weapons in this image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the robot's armor plates in Image B, there are no intricate engravings or patterns visible. The design appears clean and minimalistic, focusing more on the overall shape rather than fine details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B shows distinct separations and joints at the shoulders, elbows, and hips, which suggest points of articulation. These features are common in action figures to allow for poseability, and their presence here indicates that the robot can likely be posed in various positions.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Behind the robot in Image B, there is a background image showing a cityscape with tall buildings and a waterway, illuminated in a way that suggests a futuristic setting. This adds a dynamic and thematic element to the packaging design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cityscape in the background of Image B includes elements like illuminated buildings that could be interpreted as neon lights, contributing to a high-tech feel. However, there are no clear depictions of flying vehicles or digital interfaces. The lighting and architecture give a futuristic impression, but specific high-tech elements are not distinctly visible.",
