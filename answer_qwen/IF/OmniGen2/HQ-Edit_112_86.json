    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the main body of the teapot made of clear glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B suggest that the main body of the teapot is transparent, as light passes through it and objects behind it are faintly visible. This characteristic is typical of clear glass materials. The reflective and refractive properties further support this conclusion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the body of the teapot transparent, allowing visibility through it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the teapot allows for a degree of visibility through it, as indicated by the transparency and the way light interacts with its surface. This suggests that the material is indeed transparent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there frosted floral patterns on the surface of the teapot that resemble the original engraved rose and leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows frosted floral patterns on the teapot's surface that closely resemble engraved roses and leaves. These patterns appear to be etched or frosted onto the glass, maintaining the design's intricacy and resemblance to traditional engravings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the handle and spout made of tinted amber glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle and spout in Image B exhibit an amber hue, which is characteristic of tinted amber glass. The coloration and translucency align with what one would expect from such a material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored surface showing a clear reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows that the teapot is placed on a reflective surface, as evidenced by the distinct reflection beneath it. The clarity and detail of the reflection indicate that the surface is likely a mirror or highly polished reflective material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the floral patterns on the teapot retain the same level of detail and design as the original engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the floral patterns on the teapot in Image B retain a high level of detail and design similar to the original engravings in Image A. The intricate designs of the roses and leaves are preserved, though the medium has changed from metal to glass.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the teapot retain the original shape and proportions of the original metallic version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing Image A and Image B, the teapot in Image B retains the same overall shape and proportions as the original metallic version in Image A. The structural elements like the spout, handle, and body maintain their relative sizes and forms.",
