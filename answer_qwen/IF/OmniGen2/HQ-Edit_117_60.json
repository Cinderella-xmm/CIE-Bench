      "question": "Is the sailboat rendered entirely as a carved walnut wood sculpture, with no metallic, fabric, or realistic marine materials visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sailboat in Image B appears to be entirely made of carved walnut wood. There are no visible signs of metallic, fabric, or realistic marine materials. The uniform texture and coloration throughout the sculpture suggest it is crafted from a single material, which is consistent with the appearance of polished walnut wood.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sails made of smooth, polished walnut wood featuring visible and intricate grain patterns, rather than fabric or translucent material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sails in Image B exhibit smooth surfaces with visible grain patterns characteristic of polished walnut wood. These patterns are not typical of fabric or translucent materials, which would usually show different textures or light transmission properties. The visual cues strongly indicate that the sails are made of wood.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hull of the sculpture feature deep, textured carvings that clearly mimic the appearance of wooden planks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hull of the sculpture in Image B features deep, textured carvings that mimic the appearance of wooden planks. This can be inferred from the layered and grooved design along the hull's surface, which is a common technique used in wood carving to simulate plank construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed on a sleek, pale beige pedestal that elevates it above the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B is indeed placed on a sleek, pale beige pedestal. This pedestal elevates the sculpture above what would be considered a water surface if this were a real boat setting. The clean lines and neutral color of the pedestal provide a stark contrast to the rich tones of the walnut wood.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the natural wood tones and detailed craftsmanship of the walnut sculpture clearly stand out against the background, without being obscured by similar colors or excessive brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The natural wood tones and detailed craftsmanship of the walnut sculpture in Image B stand out clearly against the background. The background is a plain, neutral color that does not compete with the sculpture for attention, ensuring that the intricate details and warm colors of the wood are prominent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the reflection in the water consistent with the wooden sculpture, showing the carved hull and walnut sails, rather than a realistic boat reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no reflection in the water present in Image B as the sculpture is placed on a pedestal above any water surface. Therefore, there cannot be a reflection showing the carved hull and walnut sails. The question assumes a context that does not apply to the image provided.",
