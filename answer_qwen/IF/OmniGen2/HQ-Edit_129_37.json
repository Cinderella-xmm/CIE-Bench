    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the compass been transformed into a bottle-shaped object with a distinct body, neck, and cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object clearly has a structure resembling a bottle. It features a rounded bottom that serves as the body, a narrow section above it that functions as the neck, and a flat top that acts as the cap. This transformation from a traditional compass to a bottle shape is evident through these distinct parts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the body of the object a circular glass-like container with the compass face visible as an embossed or raised pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the object in Image B appears to be made of a transparent material, likely glass, given its reflective and translucent properties. The compass face is not embossed but rather printed or etched onto the surface, which is visible through the glass. The design mimics a compass face with cardinal directions and other markings.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the compass needle been replaced with a metal spray nozzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no indication of a spray nozzle on the object in Image B. Instead, the central part of the compass face retains the appearance of a traditional compass needle, albeit stylized within the context of the bottle design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the cap of the object feature an engraving resembling a vintage map?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap in Image B does not display any engravings resembling a vintage map. It appears smooth and unadorned, serving purely as a functional element of the bottle's design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the object have a bronze-toned gradient finish that gives it an antique appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B has a golden hue with a gradient effect that transitions smoothly across its surface. While this gives it a luxurious and aged look, it is more accurately described as gold-toned rather than bronze-toned.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Around the rim of the bottle in Image B, there is indeed some form of text or inscription. This text is subtle and minimalistic, fitting the description of minimalist branding. It appears to be decorative and possibly includes a brand name or other identifying marks.",
