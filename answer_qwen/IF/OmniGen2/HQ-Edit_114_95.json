      "question": "Has the Eiffel Tower been replaced with a bottle-shaped object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object is clearly a perfume bottle. The shape and structure of the Eiffel Tower are no longer present as a standalone monument but are instead integrated into the design of the bottle. This transformation from a tower to a bottle is evident through the visual cues such as the bottle's cap, its transparent body, and the embossed image within it.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the structure have a transparent or glass-like appearance with embossed lattice patterns resembling the Eiffel Tower's framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottle in Image B has a transparent or glass-like appearance, allowing the viewer to see the liquid inside. Additionally, there are embossed lattice patterns on the surface that resemble the intricate framework of the Eiffel Tower. These details are consistent with the iconic design elements of the tower, suggesting an artistic representation of the landmark within the bottle's design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a gold-colored, metallic-looking base supporting the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bottle with a gold-colored, metallic-looking cap at the top rather than a base. There is no visible base supporting the bottle in this image. The focus is on the cap and the embossed design on the bottle itself.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is indeed a faint depiction of a Parisian skyline visible on the surface of the glass bottle. This can be inferred from the silhouettes of buildings and structures that align with the known skyline of Paris, including what appears to be the Eiffel Tower and other architectural landmarks.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small, simple, and modern logo located at the neck of the bottle. It is positioned just below the cap and appears to be a minimalist design, which is typical for luxury products like perfumes. The logo adds a touch of elegance and brand identity to the overall design of the bottle.",
