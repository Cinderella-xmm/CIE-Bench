    "explanation": "The steak in the image appears as neatly sliced pieces laid out on the plate. There are no visible signs of rolling or spiraling; instead, it looks like standard cuts of meat. Spiral-rolling would typically show a coiled shape, which is not present here.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the carrots cut into a fan-shape?",
    "explanation": "The carrots in the image are whole baby carrots placed next to each other. They do not exhibit any cutting patterns that resemble a fan shape. A fan-shaped cut would involve slicing the carrot lengthwise and then spreading the slices out, which is not observed here.",
