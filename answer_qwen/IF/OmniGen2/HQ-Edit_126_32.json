    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the tree appear as a fantastical, sentient entity with an otherworldly presence rather than a natural tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree in Image B exhibits features that are not typical of natural trees. It has wings, glowing elements, and intricate patterns on its bark, which suggest a fantastical and sentient nature. These elements combined with the overall ethereal appearance indicate an otherworldly presence.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree's leaves replaced with glowing, fern-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves of the tree are distinctly different from those of a natural tree. They appear as glowing, fern-like structures, which is not characteristic of real-world foliage. This observation is based on the visual cues of their shape, glow, and arrangement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the tree’s bark display detailed silver-colored tribal or ornamental patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bark of the tree in Image B displays detailed silver-colored patterns that resemble tribal or ornamental designs. These patterns are not found on natural tree barks and contribute to the tree's fantastical appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the tree’s canopy transformed into wing-shaped, translucent, and shimmering structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The canopy of the tree in Image B has been transformed into wing-shaped structures that are translucent and shimmering. This is evident from the visual depiction of the wings extending from the trunk, which is not a feature of natural trees.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the tree’s trunk replaced by a structure made of twisted, glass-like fibers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trunk of the tree in Image B appears to be made of twisted, glass-like fibers rather than wood. This can be inferred from the way light interacts with the trunk, giving it a translucent and fibrous appearance, unlike the solid structure of a natural tree trunk.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there luminous, vine-shaped tendrils emerging from the base of the tree and extending into the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Luminous, vine-shaped tendrils are visible at the base of the tree in Image B, extending into the ground. These tendrils are glowing and have a distinct vine-like structure, which is not typical of natural tree roots.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the glowing tendrils visually blend or harmonize with the surrounding field through color, light, or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing tendrils in Image B do not visually blend or harmonize with the surrounding field. Their bright, luminous quality contrasts sharply with the green grass, making them stand out rather than blend in.",
