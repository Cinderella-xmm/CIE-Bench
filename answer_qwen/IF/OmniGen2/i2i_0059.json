      "question": "Is the elephant in the image now depicted as a mechanical structure with steampunk-style attributes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in Image B is clearly depicted with metallic textures and mechanical components such as pipes, gears, and a smokestack. These elements are characteristic of steampunk design, which typically combines Victorian-era aesthetics with imagined steam-powered technology. The visual cues, like the brass and copper colors and the intricate machinery details, support this conclusion.",

      "question": "Are copper pipes, gears, and a smokestack visible on the mechanical elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are visible copper-colored pipes running along the side of the elephant, gears integrated into its structure, and a smokestack protruding from its back. These features align with the steampunk style, which often includes such industrial elements. The presence of these components is evident through their distinct shapes and metallic finishes.",

      "question": "Do the two tourists on the back of the mechanical elephant wear goggles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two individuals seated on the mechanical elephant do not appear to be wearing goggles. Goggles are typically worn for eye protection or as part of a steampunk costume but are not present here. The absence of goggles can be confirmed by observing the clear visibility of the individuals' faces without any eyewear.",

      "question": "Has the background been changed to a foggy forest with a brass tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B has been altered to depict a foggy forest scene with a warm, brass-toned hue. This change creates an atmospheric setting that complements the steampunk theme of the mechanical elephant. Comparing this to typical natural backgrounds, the foggy and colored effect is distinctly different and enhances the fantastical element of the image.",

      "question": "Does the mechanical elephant exhibit metallic textures and industrial design elements fitting the steampunk style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical elephant in Image B exhibits several metallic textures and industrial design elements consistent with steampunk style. Features like riveted metal plates, exposed gears, and a polished brass finish contribute to this aesthetic. These design choices reflect a blend of industrial and Victorian-era influences, which are hallmarks of steampunk design.",
