    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The sock in Image B does not exhibit layered, three-dimensional construction with varying brick heights. It is a two-dimensional textile item with no depth created by different heights of bricks. The uniform surface suggests a flat, knitted structure.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
