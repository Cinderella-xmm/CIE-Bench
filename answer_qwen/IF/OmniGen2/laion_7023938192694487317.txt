    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "The individual's torso and attire in Image B are rendered with exaggerated proportions, resembling an oversized figurine. The arms and torso appear unnaturally large and muscular compared to typical human anatomy, which is a common characteristic of stylized figurines. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues of the disproportionate body structure and the overall appearance that mimics collectible action figures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "In Image B, the attire appears as a stylized athletic jersey with a glossy finish and bold logos, differing significantly from a realistic shirt design. The material looks like it has been designed for a figurine rather than actual fabric, and the logos are prominently displayed in a manner consistent with sports jerseys on collectibles. Comparing this to Image A, where the shirt has a more natural fabric texture and less emphasis on the logos, confirms the difference.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "The 'Craft' logo in Image B is visibly emphasized with increased size and brightness. It stands out sharply against the black background of the shirt due to its white color and prominent placement. In contrast, the logo in Image A is subtler and blends more naturally with the shirt's design, indicating that the emphasis in Image B is intentional for stylistic purposes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:"
    "explanation": "The shirt material in Image B is rendered with a matte-finished black polymer appearance, lacking the shine or fabric-like texture typically seen in real clothing. This is evident from the uniform, non-reflective surface that resembles plastic rather than fabric. Comparing this to Image A, where the shirt displays a realistic fabric texture with slight sheen, further supports this observation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:"
    "explanation": "The colors in the logo in Image B are rendered in elevated, bold tones such as bright red, white, and blue, which contrast sharply with the black shirt. These colors are vivid and stand out prominently, suggesting a deliberate design choice for visibility and impact. In Image A, the logo colors are more subdued and blend better with the shirt, indicating a less pronounced contrast.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:"
    "explanation": "There is indeed a detachable base beneath the figurine in Image B that resembles a sleek, contemporary stand made of polished metal. The base has a smooth, reflective surface and a modern design that complements the figurine, suggesting it is meant to display the figure effectively. There is no such base present in Image A, confirming the addition in the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7:"
    "explanation": "The base in Image B exhibits a subtle reflection consistent with polished metal. The surface shows light reflections and a smooth finish, which are characteristic of metallic materials. This detail adds to the realism and quality of the figurine's presentation. Since there is no base in Image A, this feature is unique to the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
