    "Question": "Q1: Is the lime wedge positioned on top of the glass in a way that resembles a smiling cap?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lime wedge is placed on the rim of the glass, angled slightly upward and to the side. While it does not form a literal 'smiling cap,' its position and curvature could be interpreted as part of a playful, anthropomorphic design. However, it does not resemble a cap with a smile; instead, it appears more like a garnish. The term 'smiling cap' implies a shape or arrangement that forms a smile, which is not present here. Based on visual analysis, the lime wedge is simply a decorative element, not styled to mimic a smiling cap.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are two ice cubes positioned within the glass to resemble eyes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are multiple ice cubes floating in the drink. Among them, two are clearly positioned near the top of the glass, aligned horizontally and spaced apart, resembling eyes. This is a common cartoon technique used to give inanimate objects facial features. The positioning and size of these ice cubes align with the typical representation of eyes in character designs.

    "Question": "Q3: Does the sugared rim of the glass form a visible grin-like shape?",
    "explanation": "The sugared rim in Image B is depicted as a textured, reddish-pink border around the top of the glass. It is not shaped into a grin or curved downward to suggest a smile. Instead, it follows the circular contour of the glass uniformly. A grin-like shape would require an intentional curve or indentation mimicking a mouth. There is no such feature present; therefore, the rim does not form a grin-like shape.",
