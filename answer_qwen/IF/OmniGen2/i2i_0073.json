      "question": "Has the reflection in the mirror been replaced with a nighttime city skyline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror reflects a detailed and vibrant nighttime city skyline with numerous lit buildings and a dark sky. This is clearly not a typical bathroom reflection but rather an image of a cityscape at night. The visual cues such as the illuminated skyscrapers and the dark blue sky are characteristic of a city skyline during nighttime.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the new reflection in the mirror enhance visual depth compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The new reflection in Image B shows a complex cityscape with layers of buildings extending into the distance, creating a sense of depth. In contrast, the original mirror in Image A likely reflected the plain wall or nearby objects, which would not provide the same level of depth. The city skyline introduces a three-dimensional quality that enhances the visual depth significantly.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mirror's position and frame identical to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing the two images, the mirror in both appears to be in the same position on the wall and has the same rectangular shape and golden frame. There are no visible changes to the mirror's physical attributes other than the content of its reflection.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection in Image B clearly includes a dark blue sky and numerous buildings with lights on, which are typical features of a city at night. These elements are consistent with what one would expect from a nighttime cityscape, confirming the presence of nighttime indicators.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images show the same white marble countertop, sink, faucet, soap dispenser, and decorative vase with dried flowers. There are no noticeable changes to these items between the two images, indicating that they have remained unchanged.",
