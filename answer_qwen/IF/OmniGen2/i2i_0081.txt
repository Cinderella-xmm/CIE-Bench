    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "The background in Image B displays a smooth transition from pink to blue, which is characteristic of a gradient. The colors are soft and not overly saturated, aligning with the definition of pastel colors. This analysis is based on observing the color transitions and their softness without referring to Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable neon-like glow around the mirror's frame and along the edges of the sink area. This effect is achieved through bright, vivid lighting that contrasts sharply with the surrounding colors, creating a neon appearance. This conclusion is drawn purely from the visual cues present in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "Image B exhibits elements typical of vaporwave design, such as the use of neon lighting, pastel gradients, and a retro-futuristic aesthetic. These features are commonly associated with the vaporwave style, which often incorporates nostalgic and futuristic elements. The analysis is based solely on the visual characteristics observed in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:"
    "explanation": "The gradient background in Image B extends uniformly across the scene, maintaining a consistent flow from one color to another without abrupt changes or disruptions. This creates a visually coherent environment where the gradient enhances rather than detracts from the overall scene. The assessment is made by examining the uniformity and smoothness of the gradient in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:"
    "explanation": "The mirror, sink, and cabinet in Image B retain their original shapes and positions but are now integrated into a vaporwave-inspired design. The neon lighting and gradient background influence these objects, giving them a new aesthetic while preserving their fundamental forms. Comparing this with Image A, where these objects appear in a more neutral setting, it's clear that they have been reimagined within the vaporwave context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
