      "question": "Is the image now depicting a box-like structure instead of a wall clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show a rectangular, enclosed structure with a lid that is open, revealing an object inside. This is characteristic of a box rather than a wall clock. The presence of hinges and the way the lid opens further support this conclusion. There are no visible elements such as a clock face or ornate frame extending outward that would suggest it is a wall clock.",
