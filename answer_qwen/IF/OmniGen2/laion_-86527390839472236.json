      "question": "Is the object now a tall, rectangular glass vessel instead of a soft-sided suitcase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B is clearly a suitcase with a hard shell, not a glass vessel. The structure and design elements such as the wheels, handle, and zippers are consistent with a suitcase. There is no indication of it being a tall, rectangular glass vessel.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The retractable handle in Image B remains a handle for pulling the suitcase, not a metallic spray nozzle. Its position and function have not been altered to resemble a spray nozzle, which would typically be used for dispensing liquid.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side and front panels of the suitcase appear to be made of a translucent purple-tinted material, which contrasts with the fabric texture seen in Image A. This change suggests a transformation from a soft-sided suitcase to one with a hard, transparent shell.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the original seam lines from Image A have been preserved but now appear as embossed linear patterns on the surface of the translucent purple-tinted material. This indicates a design choice to maintain the aesthetic while changing the material.",
