      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hairstyle is clearly depicted as a swirling, fluffy form with pastel pink and blue hues.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suit in Image B appears to have a glossy surface and bold geometric patterns, which are characteristic of a stylized 3D paper doll version. The sharp lines and reflective surfaces suggest a non-realistic, artistic rendering rather than a real fabric texture.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tie in Image B is indeed oversized and features bright, contrasting colors, resembling a cartoon-style element. Its exaggerated size and vivid coloration stand out against the more subdued background and other elements, indicating a deliberate stylistic choice.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

The hair retains its cotton candy appearance, the suit its glossy paper doll look, and the tie its cartoon style, ensuring consistency within each element's artistic theme.",
