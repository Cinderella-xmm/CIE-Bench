      "question": "Has the Tudor-style gown been replaced with a draped Ancient Greek-style garment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the garment is clearly a draped style with loose folds and an off-the-shoulder design, which is characteristic of Ancient Greek attire. The original Tudor-style gown typically features structured sleeves and a ruffled lace collar, which are not present here. By analyzing the visual cues such as the fabric's drape and the absence of typical Tudor elements, it can be concluded that the garment has indeed been replaced.",

      "question": "Is the garment made of golden satin with a visible lustrous sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The garment in Image B exhibits a golden hue with a reflective quality that suggests a satin-like material. The lustrous sheen is evident from the way light interacts with the fabric, creating highlights and shadows that give it a smooth and glossy appearance. This observation aligns with the characteristics of golden satin.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are visible geometric patterns along the edges of the garment, particularly around the neckline and cuffs. These patterns resemble meanders or Greek keys, which are common in ancient Greek art and design. The presence of these motifs supports the conclusion that intricate geometric patterns are embroidered on the garment.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neck area is adorned with an ornate, braided gold necklace, which replaces the ruffled lace collar seen in traditional Tudor fashion. The necklace's design and placement are consistent with ancient Greek jewelry styles, indicating a clear change from the original Tudor element.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The garment in Image B exposes the shoulders, as the sleeves have been altered to an off-the-shoulder style. This design choice is typical of ancient Greek garments, where the shoulders were often left bare. The visual evidence of exposed shoulders confirms this alteration.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B depicts a landscape with olive trees, marble columns, and a sky with clouds, which are elements commonly associated with ancient Grecian settings. This contrasts with the more formal and indoor setting typically seen in Tudor portraits, confirming a change in the background.",
