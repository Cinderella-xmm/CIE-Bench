    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the diffuse, smoky brown background been replaced with an expansive blackboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is clearly a blackboard filled with equations and sketches, which contrasts sharply with the smoky brown background in Image A. The visual cues such as the chalk-written text and diagrams on a dark surface indicate that the background has indeed been replaced.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blackboard intricately covered with chalk-written equations of relativity and swirling galactic sketches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blackboard in Image B contains various mathematical equations and a spiral sketch resembling a galaxy. These elements are consistent with what one might expect from a blackboard used for complex scientific discussions or presentations, suggesting that the answer is affirmative.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the soft, warm illumination on both Albert Einstein and the pineapple remain consistent after the background change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the change in background, the lighting on Albert Einstein and the pineapple appears to be similar in both images. The warm tones and shadows suggest that the light source and its effect have not changed significantly between Image A and Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the blackboard exhibit an aged appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blackboard in Image B does not show any visible signs of aging such as cracks, peeling paint, or discoloration. It appears clean and well-maintained, indicating that it does not exhibit an aged appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the positions and appearances of Albert Einstein and the pineapple remained unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Albert Einstein and the pineapple maintain their original positions and appearances from Image A to Image B. There are no noticeable changes in their orientation, expression, or physical characteristics, confirming that they have remained consistent.",
