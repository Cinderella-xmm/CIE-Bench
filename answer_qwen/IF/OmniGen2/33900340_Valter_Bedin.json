      "question": "Does the edited image depict the medieval structure as a colossal stone golem with a humanoid form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show a large, muscular figure with a humanoid shape standing within the archways of the medieval structure. The figure's proportions and posture are consistent with that of a golem or giant, rather than the original architectural features. This transformation is evident through the blending of the figure's limbs with the structure's arches, suggesting a creative edit to give life to the building as a golem.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the archways visibly transformed into articulated limbs resembling arms or legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the archways have been edited to appear as if they are part of the colossal figure's body. The left and right arches seem to be integrated into the figure's arms, while the central arch forms part of its torso. This suggests that the archways have indeed been transformed into limbs, enhancing the illusion of the structure being a living entity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the battlements at the top of the structure resemble a crown-like shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The battlements in Image B have been altered to include a regal crown on the head of the colossal figure. This crown-like shape sits atop the humanoid form, which aligns with the concept of a king or ruler, further emphasizing the golem's royal status. The addition of this feature transforms the battlements from mere architectural elements into a symbolic accessory.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are glowing ancient glyphs visible across the surface of the structure, replacing the original wall texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no visible glowing ancient glyphs on the surface of the structure. The texture of the walls appears consistent with the original stonework, without any added mystical symbols or patterns. Therefore, the wall texture has not been replaced by such glyphs.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the stone golem silhouetted against the sky with a mystical aura emanating from its shadowed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colossal figure is not silhouetted against the sky; instead, it is illuminated with a green glow that highlights its form. There is no dark silhouette effect present. However, the green illumination does create a mystical ambiance around the figure, but it does not specifically emanate from shadowed areas.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the small human figure been replaced by a luminous, ethereal wisp-like entity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the two images, Image A shows a small human figure walking a dog near the base of the structure. In Image B, this figure has been replaced by a glowing, translucent entity that resembles an ethereal wisp. This change transforms the scene from a mundane setting to one imbued with magical elements.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits several ethereal effects. The colossal figure is enveloped in a green glow, and the replacement of the human figure with a luminous wisp contributes to a magical atmosphere. These elements introduce a sense of enchantment and otherworldliness to the scene, indicating the presence of ethereal effects.",
