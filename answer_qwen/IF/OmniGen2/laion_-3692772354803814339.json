      "question": "Does the bottle appear as a transparent crystal vessel with visible swirling ocean wave patterns inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is clearly depicted with a transparent appearance and contains swirling ocean wave patterns inside. The visual cues such as the blue color gradient and the wave-like structures suggest an artistic representation of ocean waves. This conclusion is drawn by observing the transparency and internal design of the bottle, which aligns with the description of a crystal vessel containing visible swirling ocean wave patterns.",

      "question": "Is the label replaced with intricate golden maritime symbols instead of the original text and design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label in Image B does not appear to be replaced with intricate golden maritime symbols. Instead, it retains text and design elements similar to those typically found on whisky labels, including brand names and product descriptions. The analysis is based on the visible text and design layout on the label, which do not match the description of golden maritime symbols.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the packaging been transformed into a parchment-like scroll with aged texture and scroll-like edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B does not exhibit characteristics of a parchment-like scroll with aged texture and scroll-like edges. It maintains a rectangular box shape with clean lines and modern design elements. The analysis is based on the overall shape and texture of the packaging, which do not correspond to the described parchment-like qualities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the top of the packaging feature a compass rose with metallic-looking directional points set against a parchment background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no compass rose with metallic-looking directional points set against a parchment background at the top of the packaging in Image B. The top section of the packaging appears to have a standard label design without any nautical or compass-related imagery. The conclusion is reached by examining the top area of the packaging for any such features, which are absent.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bottle and packaging exhibit ethereal qualities such as glowing edges, light refraction, or a mystical aura consistent with an elixir vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottle and packaging in Image B do not exhibit ethereal qualities such as glowing edges, light refraction, or a mystical aura. The depiction is realistic with clear, defined edges and no visible effects that would suggest an elixir vessel with magical properties. The analysis is based on the absence of any glowing or mystical visual effects around the bottle and packaging.",
