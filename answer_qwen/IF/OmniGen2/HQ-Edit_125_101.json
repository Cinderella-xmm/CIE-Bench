      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical boundary resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B clearly show a transparent spherical boundary that encloses the entire scene, resembling a snow globe. The edges of the sphere are visible and reflect light, indicating its transparency and three-dimensional nature. This is consistent with the common design of snow globes, which typically have a clear, spherical container to house miniature scenes.",

      "question": "Is there a 3D ballerina figure inside the snow globe that replicates the leaping pose of the original dancer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a 3D ballerina figure inside the snow globe. The ballerina is depicted in a leaping pose, similar to the dancer's pose in Image A. The figure is positioned mid-air within the globe, suggesting it is meant to replicate the dynamic movement of the original dancer. The analysis of this figure is based on its posture, attire, and placement within the scene.",

      "question": "Are the Eiffel Tower and at least two other recognizable miniature Parisian landmarks present inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a miniature Eiffel Tower as well as at least two other recognizable Parisian landmarks inside the snow globe. These structures are smaller in scale compared to the Eiffel Tower but are distinct enough to be identified as separate landmarks. This conclusion is drawn from their shapes and positions relative to the Eiffel Tower, which are characteristic of Parisian architecture.",

      "question": "Are there visible swirling snowflakes surrounding the Eiffel Tower and other landmarks inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the snow globe in Image B, there are visible swirling particles that resemble snowflakes. These particles are scattered around the Eiffel Tower and other landmarks, creating an effect typical of snow globes when they are shaken. The presence of these particles enhances the illusion of a snowy scene within the enclosed space.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the snow globe resting on a base made of bronze and glass, with visible engravings in French script?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B is resting on a base that appears to be made of bronze and glass. The base has engravings that resemble French script, adding to the thematic consistency of the Parisian scene within the globe. The material and design of the base are inferred from its color, texture, and the style of the engravings, which are consistent with traditional snow globe bases.",
