      "question": "Is the golden car depicted in a 3D chibi style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The car in Image B appears to be a realistic 3D model with detailed features such as windows, wheels, and body panels. It does not exhibit exaggerated or simplified features typical of chibi art, which usually involves large heads, small bodies, and minimalistic details. The car maintains proportions that are consistent with real-world vehicles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car look like it is emerging from the photo frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is positioned within an orange photo frame, but parts of the car extend beyond the edges of the frame, giving the impression that it is emerging from it. This visual effect suggests a transition from a two-dimensional representation to a three-dimensional space.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a human hand visible, grasping the edges of the photo frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a human hand holding the orange photo frame. The fingers are visibly wrapped around the edge of the frame, indicating that the hand is indeed grasping it.",

      "question": "Has the car retained its golden color in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The car in Image B retains its golden color, which is consistent with the original depiction in Image A. The lighting and shading on the car's surface suggest a metallic finish, maintaining the same aesthetic quality as before.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition from a flat 2D space to a 3D reality clearly depicted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition from a flat 2D space to a 3D reality is clearly depicted in Image B. The car extends beyond the boundaries of the photo frame, creating a visual illusion of depth and dimensionality. This effect is enhanced by the realistic rendering of the car and the hand holding the frame.",
