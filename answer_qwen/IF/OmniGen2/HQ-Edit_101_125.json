      "question": "Is the elderly gentleman depicted in a cartoon style with simplified features and exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elderly gentleman in Image B is depicted with clean lines, simplified shapes, and lacks detailed textures that would be present in a realistic portrayal. His features are exaggerated for stylistic effect, such as the large glasses and prominent mustache, which are common characteristics of cartoon illustrations. The proportions, like the size of his head relative to his body, also appear slightly exaggerated.",

      "question": "Is the newspaper visibly larger than normal in size relative to the gentlemanâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the newspaper appears disproportionately large compared to the gentleman's body. This exaggeration is typical in cartoons to emphasize certain elements or actions. The newspaper covers a significant portion of the figure, suggesting it is larger than a normal-sized newspaper would be in relation to an adult human.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The newspaper pages in Image B contain illustrated content that looks whimsical and playful, rather than realistic text. There are images of people and objects that seem designed to entertain rather than inform, which aligns with the overall cartoon style of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A blank thought bubble is clearly visible above the gentleman's head in Image B. Thought bubbles are commonly used in cartoons to represent characters' thoughts or speech without words, and this one is unpopulated, indicating an absence of specific thoughts being conveyed.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of stylized park elements like cartoon trees, grass, and flowers. These elements lack the detail and realism found in natural settings and instead use simple shapes and colors to suggest a park environment, which is characteristic of cartoon illustrations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs soft pastel colors throughout, including in the background and the gentleman's clothing. These colors contribute to a calm and gentle atmosphere, which is often intended in cartoon-style illustrations to evoke a sense of peace and simplicity.",
