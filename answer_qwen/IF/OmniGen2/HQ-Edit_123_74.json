      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet appears consistent in size relative to the snowboarder's head and body. There are no visual cues suggesting disproportionate enlargement. The helmet maintains a realistic scale when considering typical proportions of helmets on human figures. Therefore, based on visual analysis alone, there is no indication that the helmet has been enlarged.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Are the red elements of the snowboarder’s outfit vivid and highly saturated, contrasting sharply with the deep blue tones of the snowy environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red elements of the snowboarder's outfit in Image B are indeed vivid and highly saturated. They stand out prominently against the deep blue background, which represents the snowy environment. This high contrast is achieved through the use of bright, saturated colors that naturally draw attention and create a visually striking effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowdrifts and pine trees in Image B do not exhibit a paper-cut style. Instead, they have smooth, rounded edges and lack the layered textures typically associated with cut paper. The illustration style here is more fluid and continuous, without the sharp, angular lines characteristic of paper cuts.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show multiple snowboarding poses or trick variations. It depicts a single pose of the snowboarder in motion. There are no additional poses or indications of interchangeable action presets within the frame of the image.",
