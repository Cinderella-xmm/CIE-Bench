      "question": "Is the composition preserved with the elephant and rider centrally positioned, but rendered in a flat, stylized manner typical of Mughal miniatures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of the image is preserved with the elephant and rider centrally positioned, but it is rendered in a flat, stylized manner typical of Mughal miniatures. The perspective is not realistic, and the figures and objects are presented in a two-dimensional way, which is a hallmark of this artistic style. The central positioning of the main subjects draws the viewer's attention immediately, while the background elements are integrated seamlessly into the overall design.",
