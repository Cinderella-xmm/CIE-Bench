    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The image clearly shows a structured layout with a central illustration of a cat, surrounded by text and design elements that are typical of digital character cards in RPG games. The presence of a nameplate, stat indicators, and a decorative border further supports this analysis.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "Upon examining the image, the name 'Solara the Watcher' is prominently displayed at the top of the card on an orange banner, not at the bottom. Therefore, it does not match the description of being on a sleek nameplate at the bottom of the card.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",

}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",

{
    "Question": "Q6:",
