      "question": "Is the image formatted as a digital character card with a structured layout resembling an RPG collectible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly shows a structured layout with a central illustration of a cat, surrounded by text and design elements that are typical of digital character cards in RPG games. The presence of a nameplate, stat indicators, and a decorative border further supports this analysis.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the name 'Solara the Watcher' displayed on a sleek nameplate at the bottom of the card?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the image, the name 'Solara the Watcher' is prominently displayed at the top of the card on an orange banner, not at the bottom. Therefore, it does not match the description of being on a sleek nameplate at the bottom of the card.",

      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question": "Does the cat and surrounding elements exhibit a semi-realistic 3D art style with a soft, polished finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat and its surroundings exhibit characteristics of 3D art with a polished finish. The fur texture, lighting, and shading suggest a semi-realistic style commonly used in modern digital illustrations for collectible cards.",

    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image contains stat bars labeled 'AGINITTY', 'CURAOUTTY', and 'SHAMP', but these do not correspond to the specified stats 'Agility +9', 'Curiosity +10', and 'Charm +8'. Thus, the exact stats mentioned are not present.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the card, there is indeed a golden-colored banner which serves as a background for the character's name 'Solara the Watcher'. This matches the description provided in the question.",
