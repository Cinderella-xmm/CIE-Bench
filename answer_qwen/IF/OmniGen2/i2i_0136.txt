    "Question": "Q1: Is the orange depicted as a rubber keychain rather than a natural fruit?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the orange has an additional feature—a metallic ring attached to its stem—which is not typical of a natural fruit. This suggests that it is designed to be used as a keychain.
