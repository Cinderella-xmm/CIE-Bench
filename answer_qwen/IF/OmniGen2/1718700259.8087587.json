      "question": "Is the police car fully constructed from LEGO bricks, with no realistic or photographic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The police car in Image B is clearly constructed from LEGO bricks, as evidenced by the visible studs and modular structure typical of LEGO models. There are no photographic or realistic elements present; everything appears to be made from plastic building blocks.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the body panels of the car primarily composed of blue and black LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body panels of the car in Image B are primarily composed of blue LEGO bricks, with black bricks used for certain details like the grille and lower sections. This matches the color scheme typically seen in LEGO vehicles where primary colors are used for the main body.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The emergency lights on top of the car in Image B appear to be made from red and blue translucent LEGO pieces, which is a common choice for representing lights in LEGO sets due to their ability to mimic illumination. The front headlights also seem to use similar translucent pieces to represent light sources.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The windows of the car in Image B are not constructed from beige LEGO bricks. Instead, they appear to be transparent or clear pieces, which is standard practice in LEGO designs to simulate glass windows.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grille and wheels of the car in Image B are indeed constructed from small LEGO blocks, showing detailed brickwork and a modular structure. This is characteristic of LEGO designs, where intricate details are built using smaller pieces.",
