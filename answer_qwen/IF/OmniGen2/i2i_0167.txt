    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image include the apple's current front view as originally shown?",
    "explanation": "The edited image contains a whole apple in its original form, which is similar to what would be considered the 'current front view' of an apple. This whole apple is depicted in the top left quadrant of the collage. The analysis is based on recognizing that one of the images shows an uncut apple, which aligns with the typical front view of an apple.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a cross-section view of the apple that shows its inner flesh texture and seeds?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, three out of four quadrants display the apple cut in half, revealing the inner flesh and seeds. The visual cues such as the white interior, visible seeds, and the division line confirm this. Common knowledge about apples supports that these features are characteristic of a cross-section view.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the image contain a top view that clearly displays the apple's stem structure and calyx area?",
    "explanation": "None of the quadrants in the edited image provide a top-down perspective of the apple. All views either show the whole apple from the side or a cross-section. Therefore, there is no clear display of the stem structure and calyx area from a top view.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the current front view of the apple remained unchanged compared to the original image?",
    "explanation": "Comparing the whole apple in the top left quadrant of the edited image with the original image, both depict the apple in its entirety without any cuts. The lighting and angle appear consistent, suggesting that the front view has not changed. The comparison relies on identifying the same visual characteristics between the two images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the cross-section of the apple reveal both the flesh texture and seeds accurately?",
    "explanation": "The cross-section views in the edited image show the apple's interior with visible white flesh and seeds, which aligns with common knowledge about apple anatomy. The texture appears smooth and natural, and the seeds are positioned correctly within the core, indicating an accurate representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
