    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Blue Jay appears to be a miniature sculpture rather than a live bird. This conclusion is drawn from its perfectly symmetrical and polished appearance, which lacks the natural imperfections of a living creature. The uniformity in color and texture suggests it is made of a solid material like ceramic or metal. Additionally, its placement within a glass dome further supports this as live birds are not typically displayed in such enclosures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The Blue Jay sculpture in Image B is indeed enclosed within a transparent glass dome. This is evident from the clear, rounded structure surrounding the bird, which reflects light and has a knob on top, typical of display domes used for showcasing objects. The transparency allows a full view of the sculpture while protecting it, indicating an intentional design choice for presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "There is no wooden perch beneath the sculpture with ivy vines visibly winding upward along it in Image B. Instead, the bird is perched on what appears to be a small tree stump.
