      "question": "Has the vase and bouquet been transformed into a 3D printed display model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no vase or bouquet present in Image B. The image shows a bulldog on a skateboard, which appears to be a 3D printed model placed on a stand at what seems like a tech expo booth. Therefore, it's clear that there has been no transformation of a vase and bouquet into a 3D printed display model.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 3D printed model appear to be made of matte material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bulldog and skateboard in Image B exhibit a smooth surface with soft reflections, suggesting a matte finish rather than a glossy one. This conclusion is drawn from observing the lack of sharp highlights or reflective properties typically associated with glossy materials.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a display plaque added at the base of the 3D printed model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the base of the 3D printed model in Image B, there is a rectangular object that resembles a display plaque. It is positioned in front of the model and likely contains information about the exhibit, which is common practice for display models in tech expos.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features a large blue panel with text and logos that resemble branding typical of a tech expo booth. There are also people in the background who appear to be attendees or exhibitors, further supporting the setting of a tech expo.",

      "question": "Does the 3D printed model maintain the design of the original vase and bouquet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any elements resembling a vase or bouquet. Instead, it features a bulldog on a skateboard, which is entirely different from a vase and bouquet. Thus, the question of maintaining the design of a vase and bouquet is irrelevant here.",
