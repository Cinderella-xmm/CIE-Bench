    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image display a visual texture consistent with satin paper, including a soft sheen and slight reflectivity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not exhibit the visual characteristics of satin paper. Satin paper typically has a smooth surface with a soft sheen and slight reflectivity, but the image appears to have a matte finish typical of printed materials or digital renderings. The lack of visible light reflections or glossy areas suggests it is not satin.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the suit rendered with visible watercolor effects, showing blended blue-black hues and soft, painterly edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suit in the edited image indeed shows watercolor effects. The blue-black hues are blended softly, and the edges of the suit appear painterly rather than sharply defined. This style mimics the fluidity and blending characteristic of watercolor techniques.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible golden pinstripes running vertically along the suit jacket, consistent with the watercolor aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no golden pinstripes visible on the suit jacket in the edited image. The suit maintains a solid color scheme with watercolor effects, but no additional patterns such as pinstripes are present. The absence of such details aligns with the watercolor aesthetic which focuses on color blending rather than sharp lines.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the series of images provided, there are two different ties visible: one red tie in Image A and a patterned black tie in Image B. This indicates that there are at least two distinct tie patterns across the images.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is presented within what appears to be a leather-bound album frame. The frame features an embossed title with visible texture and depth, suggesting real leather and raised lettering. These elements contribute to a luxurious and classic presentation style.",
