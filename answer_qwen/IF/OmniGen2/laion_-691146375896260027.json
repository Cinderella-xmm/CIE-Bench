      "question": "Is the entire dresser constructed from LEGO bricks, primarily in brown and gold colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dresser appears to be constructed from LEGO bricks. The visible studs on the top surface and the uniformity of the brick sizes suggest a LEGO construction. The colors used are primarily brown for the body and gold for the decorative elements, which aligns with common LEGO color options.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the decorative patterns on the front of the dresser recreated using small interlocking LEGO pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The front of the dresser in Image B shows intricate patterns that resemble the ornate designs typically found on such furniture. However, these patterns are composed of small interlocking LEGO pieces, as indicated by the visible studs and the blocky nature of the design. This suggests that the decorative patterns have indeed been recreated using LEGO pieces.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The curved sides and legs of the dresser in Image B appear smooth but are actually constructed from sloped LEGO bricks joined together. The curves are achieved through the strategic placement of these sloped bricks, creating the illusion of smoothness while maintaining the LEGO aesthetic.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the dresser in Image B is covered with gray flat LEGO tiles, replacing what would traditionally be a marble surface. The flat, uniform appearance and the absence of natural stone textures confirm this change.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
