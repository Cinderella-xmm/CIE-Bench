      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The image is presented as a two-panel layout within an open book, not four panels. Each panel shows a similar serene lake scene with slight variations in the person's activity and attire. The visual cues clearly indicate a two-page spread rather than four separate panels.",
