    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the person's pose and expression are depicted using simple lines and shapes typical of cartoon art.

    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The raised hand is not present in Image B. Instead, the person is holding a phone with both hands, and there is no indication of a waving gesture. Comparing this to Image A, where the raised hand is clearly visible, it can be concluded that the raised hand has been removed or replaced in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the person is depicted with an open mouth, which is consistent with the expression of excitement or speaking.

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the person holding a phone, which covers part of their face similarly to how a camera would in Image A. The phone's position and size suggest it is being used like a camera, aligning with the action implied in the original image. Therefore, the function of covering part of the face is preserved, even though the object has changed from a camera to a phone.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
