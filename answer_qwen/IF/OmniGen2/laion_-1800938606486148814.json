      "question": "Has the shoe upper been replaced with a transparent material that reveals intricate circuitry patterns inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe upper appears to have a translucent quality with visible circuitry patterns inside. This is evident from the glowing blue lines and dots that resemble electronic circuits, which are not typical features of standard sneakers. The analysis combines visual cues like transparency and intricate patterns with knowledge of futuristic design elements.",

      "question": "Does the Swoosh logo emit a cool neon blue glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Swoosh logo in Image B emits a cool neon blue glow. This can be observed by noting the bright blue illumination surrounding the black Swoosh, which contrasts sharply with the rest of the shoe's design. Comparing this with common sneaker designs where logos are usually static, it's clear that this is an edited feature for a futuristic look.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a small digital screen attached to the strap that displays dynamic animations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a small digital screen attached to the strap displaying dynamic animations. This is inferred from the rectangular shape on the strap with a glowing blue display that seems to show moving images or patterns, which is not a feature found in traditional sneakers. The conclusion is drawn from combining the visual evidence with knowledge of advanced technology integration in design.",

      "question": "Is there a collapsible digital shoe box with a metallic finish and holographic branding visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no collapsible digital shoe box with a metallic finish and holographic branding visible in Image B. The image focuses solely on the shoe itself without any accompanying packaging or additional objects. Therefore, based on the visual content provided, such an object does not exist in the image.",

      "question": "Are modern geometric patterns visible on the surface of the digital shoe box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there is no digital shoe box present in Image B, as previously established, it follows that there cannot be modern geometric patterns visible on its surface. The question is irrelevant given the absence of the object in question.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the futuristic modifications, the sneaker in Image B retains its original structural proportions and silhouette. The overall shape and form of the shoe remain consistent with typical athletic footwear, even though the materials and details have been altered. This conclusion is reached by observing the shoe's outline and comparing it with general sneaker designs.",
