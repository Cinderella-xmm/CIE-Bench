    "Question": "Q1: Are the two towers of the castle now depicted as thick, upright tree trunks with visible, textured bark?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show that the structures resembling the original towers have been transformed into large, vertical forms that mimic the appearance of tree trunks.

    "Question": "Q2: Have the stone walls between the towers been replaced with large, spreading branches that extend outward from the tree trunks?",
