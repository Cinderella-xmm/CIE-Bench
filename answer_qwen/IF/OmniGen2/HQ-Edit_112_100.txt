    "Question": "Q1: Is the eagle enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
    "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B clearly show an eagle surrounded by a smooth, transparent structure that resembles a glass dome. The dome's transparency allows the eagle and its surroundings to be seen clearly while enclosing them. This is further supported by the reflection and refraction of light on the surface of the dome, which are characteristic of glass materials.",
