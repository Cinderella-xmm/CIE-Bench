    "Question": "Q1: Is only one zebra visible in the edited image?",

    "Question": "Q2: Has all the grass been removed from the background?",

    "Question": "Q4: Does the edited image maintain a calm and solitary atmosphere without extra distractions?",
    "explanation": "The edited image features a single individual skiing against a plain green gradient background. The simplicity of the background and the absence of additional elements contribute to a calm and undistracted atmosphere. Comparing this with Image A, which had a snowy landscape with trees and a 'START' banner, the edited image removes these distractions, enhancing the sense of solitude.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the original zebra's position and appearance preserved in the edited image?",
