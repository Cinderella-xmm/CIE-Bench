      "question": "Is the image vertically oriented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is square-shaped, with equal dimensions on both sides. There are no visual cues indicating that it is taller than it is wide or vice versa. Therefore, it cannot be classified as vertically oriented.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has a traditional LEGO minifigure been added next to the pear-inspired animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small figure resembling a traditional LEGO minifigure standing beside the pear-inspired object. The figure has distinct features such as a blocky head, arms, and legs typical of LEGO minifigures. This analysis is based solely on the visual characteristics of the figure in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the pear-inspired animal feature a polished, seamless style with a bitten section that complements the pear's characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pear-inspired object in Image B appears to have a smooth and polished surface, consistent with the texture of a real pear. The bitten section reveals the inner flesh of the pear, which looks realistic and complements the overall appearance of the pear. This conclusion is drawn from observing the texture and design of the pear in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both figures enclosed within a transparent glass cube that reflects the natural wood grain look and color of the backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the pear-inspired object and the LEGO minifigure are placed inside a transparent glass cube in Image B. The cube does not reflect any wood grain but rather provides a clear view of the objects inside. The background does not appear to have a wood grain texture; instead, it seems to be a solid color gradient.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image utilize sophisticated lighting with warm hues that align with the original photo's tones, and does the background transition smoothly from a soft caramel shade to a gentle cream tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs warm lighting that enhances the colors of the pear and the LEGO figure. The background transitions smoothly from a darker caramel shade at the top to a lighter cream tone at the bottom, creating a gradient effect. This observation is based on the visual analysis of the lighting and background in Image B.",
