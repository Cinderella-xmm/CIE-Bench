      "question": "Is the figure enclosed within a transparent spherical snow globe structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is clearly enclosed within a transparent spherical structure that resembles a snow globe. The visual cues include the rounded, reflective surface surrounding the figure and the presence of what appears to be falling snow inside the sphere. This aligns with common knowledge of snow globes, which typically feature such a design to create a miniature scene.",

      "question": "Does the figure retain long hair and a muscled neckline, now depicted in a chibi-style with translucent icy armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure has long hair and a muscled neckline, depicted in a chibi-style with translucent icy armor. The character's proportions are exaggeratedly cute and small, typical of chibi art style, while the armor has a frosty, semi-transparent appearance suggesting an icy theme. This analysis combines the visual elements with the understanding of chibi art and icy textures.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the snow globe in Image B, there are indeed miniature ice shards encircling the figure. These shards are visible as small, crystalline structures floating around the character, enhancing the winter-themed aesthetic. This observation is based on the visual details and the thematic consistency with the snowy environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is positioned atop a pedestal that appears to be covered in snow, with jagged edges resembling icy terrain. This conclusion is drawn from the white, textured surface beneath the figure and its uneven, sharp contours, which are consistent with a snowy, jagged landscape.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the snow globe in Image B is made of wood with visible carved runes. The wooden texture and the intricate patterns resembling runes can be observed at the bottom of the snow globe. This detail adds to the overall fantasy and thematic depth of the image, combining visual evidence with knowledge of decorative elements often found in themed objects.",
