      "question": "Does the edited image feature bold black outlines around figures and objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are distinct and bold black outlines surrounding the figure of the woman in the kimono as well as the cherry blossoms and other elements. This style is reminiscent of traditional Japanese art forms like ukiyo-e, where bold lines are used to define shapes and separate them from the background. The use of such outlines enhances the flatness and graphic quality of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kimono in Image B displays a flat color scheme with minimal gradient or shading.

      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms depicted with simplified shapes and muted pink hues rather than vibrant or detailed rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cherry blossoms in Image B are rendered with simple, rounded shapes and a consistent muted pink hue. There is no intricate detailing or variation in color intensity that would suggest a more realistic or vibrant depiction. This simplicity contributes to the overall stylized and illustrative nature of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The path stones and poles in Image B do not exhibit any visible textured patterns. Instead, they appear smooth and uniform, which is typical for an illustration aiming for a clean and stylized look. The absence of textures suggests a focus on form and line over detailed surface qualities.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B includes stylized rolling hills in the distance, rendered in a way that is consistent with traditional ukiyo-e landscapes. These hills are depicted with soft curves and layered colors, creating a sense of depth while maintaining a flat, two-dimensional appearance typical of ukiyo-e art.",
