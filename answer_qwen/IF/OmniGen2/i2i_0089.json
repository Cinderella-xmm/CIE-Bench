      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit a 3D style with depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kitten in Image B appears to be leaping out of the screen, creating an illusion of depth. This effect is achieved through perspective and shadowing techniques that give the impression of three-dimensional space. The kitten's position relative to the monitor frame and the shadow beneath it further enhance this 3D perception. Combining these visual cues with common knowledge about 3D imagery leads to the conclusion that the image exhibits a 3D style.",

      "question": "Does the edited image depict the kitten as actively jumping out of the screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten is shown mid-air with its legs extended forward and its body angled as if it is leaping. The positioning and posture suggest movement and action. Additionally, the shadow on the screen indicates the direction of motion, reinforcing the idea that the kitten is jumping out of the screen. These observations align with the depiction of active movement.",

      "question": "Is the 3D effect in the image achieved without requiring special glasses or external devices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D effect in Image B relies on visual tricks such as perspective, shadowing, and the positioning of the kitten within the frame. These elements create an illusion of depth that can be perceived without the need for special glasses or external devices. The image uses standard 2D rendering techniques to simulate a 3D experience, which is accessible to viewers without additional equipment.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the kitten's original appearance, including color and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the kitten retains its orange fur color and striped pattern in both images. However, Image B includes additional elements like glasses and a more dynamic pose, but these do not alter the fundamental appearance of the kitten's fur texture and color. The core visual characteristics are preserved despite the edits.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the kitten's features still clearly visible and not obscured by the 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten's features such as its eyes, nose, whiskers, and fur patterns remain clear and distinct. The 3D effects, while enhancing the sense of depth, do not obscure these features. The kitten's face is fully visible, and its expression is recognizable, indicating that the 3D elements complement rather than hinder the visibility of its features.",
