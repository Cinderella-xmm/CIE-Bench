    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sock fully constructed from visible interlocking LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sock in Image B is a textile item with a knitted texture, not constructed from interlocking LEGO-style bricks. The visual cues such as the fabric's elasticity and the seamless pattern indicate it is made of yarn or thread rather than plastic bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original black, gray, and white patterns of the sock retained using blocky LEGO brick shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sock in Image B retains its original black, gray, and white patterns but does not use blocky LEGO brick shapes to create these patterns. The design appears to be a continuous knit pattern typical of socks, without any indication of being composed of individual brick-like elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sculpture exhibit layered, three-dimensional construction with varying brick heights to create depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sock in Image B does not exhibit layered, three-dimensional construction with varying brick heights. It is a two-dimensional textile item with no depth created by different heights of bricks. The uniform surface suggests a flat, knitted structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tag at the top of the sculpture an orange LEGO brick piece?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tag at the top of the sock in Image B is an orange rectangular piece that resembles a LEGO brick in color but lacks the distinct studs and holes characteristic of LEGO bricks. It is more likely a fabric tag attached for branding purposes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sculpture displayed upright in a clean, minimalist gallery-like environment with no clutter or distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sock in Image B is displayed upright against a clean, minimalist background with no clutter or distracting elements. This presentation style is common in product photography to focus attention on the item itself, suggesting a gallery-like environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the sculpture display clear architectural detail such as aligned brick rows, defined edges, and intentional structural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sock in Image B does not display clear architectural detail such as aligned brick rows, defined edges, and intentional structural form. Instead, it has a smooth, continuous texture typical of knitted fabrics, lacking the segmented appearance of a LEGO sculpture.",
