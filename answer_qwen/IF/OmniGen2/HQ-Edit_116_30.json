      "question": "Is the cathedral rendered as a miniature model made of warm-stained wood instead of stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cathedral in Image B appears to be a miniature model with a warm, uniform wood tone throughout its structure. The material looks like stained wood rather than stone due to the consistent color and texture that is characteristic of wood models. This conclusion is drawn from observing the smooth, polished surface and the lack of stone-like roughness or variation in hue.",

      "question": "Is the wooden cathedral model enclosed within an ornate shadow box with visible framing and a transparent front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cathedral enclosed within a wooden frame that resembles an ornate shadow box. The framing is visible around the edges, and there seems to be a transparent front allowing the view of the model inside. This setup is typical for displaying detailed miniature models, protecting them while showcasing their intricate design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Gothic architectural details such as pointed arches, flying buttresses, and rose window tracery are clearly visible in Image B. These elements are meticulously crafted in miniature form, maintaining the complexity and precision expected in Gothic architecture. The level of detail suggests careful attention to replicating these features accurately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire cathedral model colored in warm stained wood tones, avoiding stone-gray or cold metallic hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire cathedral model is uniformly colored in warm stained wood tones. There are no signs of stone-gray or cold metallic hues; instead, the consistent warm tone reinforces the impression of a wooden model. This observation is based on the visual inspection of the model's surface and coloration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no visible miniature pews or chandeliers inside the cathedral model. The interior is not detailed enough to discern such specific elements, and the focus appears to be on the exterior architectural features rather than the interior furnishings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible clock mechanism at the back of the model in Image B. Additionally, there are no small figures positioned along a path suggesting movement. The image focuses on the architectural aspects of the cathedral rather than incorporating a clock or animated figures.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there are no small figures present along any path in Image B, it is not possible for them to depict actions related to religious devotion. The absence of such figures means this question cannot be answered affirmatively based on the visual content provided.",
