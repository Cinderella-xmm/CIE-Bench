      "question": "Is the red Santa hat replaced with a tricorn hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is wearing a black hat with a distinct three-cornered shape, which is characteristic of a tricorn hat. This style of hat was commonly worn by explorers and military officers in historical periods. The visual cues such as the shape and color clearly indicate that it is not the traditional red Santa hat.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gloves in Image B appear to be made of a material resembling leather, with a design that extends up the forearm, typical of gauntlets. They are darker in color and have a more rugged appearance compared to the smooth, white gloves typically associated with Santa Claus.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The attire in Image B includes a red jacket with large buttons and leather straps, which aligns with styles worn by explorers in historical times.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
