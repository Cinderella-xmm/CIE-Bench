        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B has been transformed into an owl character with distinct features such as a beak, feathers, and large eyes.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The attire in Image B has been replaced with a feathered cloak that retains the original blue color but now has a textured, feather-like surface. The visual cues show a blue body with detailed feather textures, indicating a change from a human's clothing to an owl's natural plumage. This conclusion is drawn by observing the texture and pattern changes on the owl's body.",

      "explanation": "Small glasses are visibly present and securely placed on the owl’s beak.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no expressive wing movements visible in Image B that mimic hand gestures. The owl's wings are not extended or positioned in a way that suggests movement or gesture. Therefore, the transformation does not include replacing hand gestures with wing movements.",

      "explanation": "Speech bubbles are present in Image B containing words related to articulation and clarity. The visual cues include speech bubbles with text like 'Skills,' 'Tips,' and other phrases that relate to public speaking abilities.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is a neutral beige color without patterns or distracting elements.
