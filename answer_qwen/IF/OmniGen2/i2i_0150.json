    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the forest background been replaced with a city balcony railing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background clearly shows a city skyline with tall buildings and a balcony railing in the foreground. This is distinctly different from a forest setting, which would typically include trees, foliage, and natural landscapes. The presence of urban structures confirms that the original forest background has indeed been replaced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bird positioned on the sunlit balcony as instructed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B is perched on what appears to be a balcony railing. The lighting suggests it is sunny, with light illuminating the bird and parts of the railing. This matches the instruction for the bird to be on a sunlit balcony.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a blurred city skyline visible in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features out-of-focus elements resembling skyscrapers and other urban structures, typical of a city skyline. The blurring effect adds depth and indicates a distant view, consistent with a cityscape backdrop.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bird maintain its original position relative to the new balcony railing background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the bird's posture and orientation remain largely unchanged. It is still facing slightly to the side, maintaining a similar stance as if it were on a branch. The transition from a tree branch to a balcony railing does not alter the bird's position significantly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall lighting of the image match the sunlit balcony setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is bright and warm, casting soft shadows and highlighting the bird and the balcony railing. This type of lighting is consistent with sunlight, suggesting that the scene is set during a time when the sun is shining, matching the sunlit balcony setting.",
