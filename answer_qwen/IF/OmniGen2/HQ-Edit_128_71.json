      "question": "Is the Statue of Liberty fully enclosed within a vintage-style glass lantern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Statue of Liberty is clearly visible within a transparent glass dome that resembles a vintage-style lantern. The base of the dome and its structure suggest it is designed to enclose the statue completely. This conclusion is drawn from observing the seamless integration of the statue with the glass enclosure, which covers it entirely without any visible gaps.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the Statue of Liberty display both verdigris (greenish-blue) and copper-hued (reddish-brown) patinas on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Statue of Liberty in Image B displays a uniform verdigris patina, characteristic of its copper material exposed to the elements over time. There are no visible areas with a copper-hued patina. This analysis is based on the consistent greenish-blue coloration across the statue's surface, which aligns with common knowledge about the statue's appearance due to oxidation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background sky rendered in soft pastel colors such as pale pink, lavender, or mint green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background sky in Image B features soft pastel colors, including pale pink and lavender tones. These colors are evident in the gradient of the sky and the silhouettes of buildings, which are rendered in a gentle, non-realistic style. This observation is made by analyzing the overall color palette and comparing it to typical pastel hues.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there tiny ships and wave patterns visible beneath the Statue of Liberty in the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Beneath the Statue of Liberty in Image B, there are small depictions of ships and wave patterns, suggesting a miniature diorama setting. These details are visible at the base of the statue, where tiny ships appear to be floating on stylized waves. This conclusion is reached by closely examining the lower part of the image for such elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a visible revolving mechanism (e.g., rotating base, gears, or central axis) at the foundation of the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible revolving mechanism such as rotating gears or a central axis at the foundation of the diorama in Image B. The base appears static and solid, with no indication of movement or mechanical components. This assessment is based on the absence of any structural elements typically associated with rotation.",

      "question": "Does the diorama maintain the recognizable grandeur and detailed features of the Statue of Liberty despite being miniature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite being a miniature representation, the diorama in Image B maintains the recognizable grandeur and detailed features of the Statue of Liberty. Key elements like the crown, torch, and tablet are clearly depicted, preserving the iconic image of the statue. This conclusion is drawn from observing the faithful reproduction of these distinctive features in a smaller scale.",
