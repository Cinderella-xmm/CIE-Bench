    "Question": "Q3: Is the vehicle painted in colors such as reds, oranges, or yellows that match the character of jerk chicken?",
    "explanation": "The background color of Image B is a solid orange, which is commonly associated with warmth and spiciness, characteristics often linked to jerk chicken. However, the vehicle itself retains its original beige color from Image A, without any significant changes in hue to reflect the theme. Thus, while the background suggests thematic colors, the vehicle does not incorporate them into its paint scheme.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the entire vehicle, including windows and doors, covered in thematic design elements for jerk chicken?",
