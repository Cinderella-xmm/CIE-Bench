        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is dressed in a flowing orange robe with a turban, which does not align with the typical attire of a Byzantine monk. Byzantine monks usually wear dark-colored robes and hoods, often brown or black, and their appearance is more austere. The attire here seems more ceremonial or regal rather than monastic.",
