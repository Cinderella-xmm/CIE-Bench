      "question": "Is the image presented as a mounted card with visible borders and a card-like format?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is clearly presented within a rectangular frame that resembles a mounted card. The borders are visible, and the overall format mimics a card-like presentation, which is evident from the clean edges and the way it stands out against the background.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figure rendered as a silhouette with intricate, decorative cut-out patterns characteristic of paper-cut art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in the image is depicted as a silhouette with no internal details, except for the intricate cut-out patterns along the bottom edge of the card. These patterns resemble decorative lace or floral designs, characteristic of paper-cut art techniques.",

    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The book held by the figure appears disproportionately large compared to the figure itself. This exaggeration is a common artistic choice in silhouettes to emphasize the object being held, making it more visually striking.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no visible ornate lace patterns integrated into the sweater in this image. The figure is a solid black silhouette without any internal details, so such patterns cannot be observed.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no bookshelves present in the background of this image. The background is plain and lacks any textural elements like grain or aging, focusing solely on the silhouette and decorative patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the image mounted on a background that appears to be textured, antique-gold colored cardstock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is mounted on a background that has a textured appearance and an antique-gold color. This can be inferred from the warm tone and subtle variations in shading that suggest a textured surface.",
