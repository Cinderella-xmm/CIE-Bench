    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the basketball player depicted in a mid-dribble pose with the ball near the ground and body in motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basketball player is shown holding a ball in each hand, with one arm extended forward and the other back. The body posture suggests movement, but the balls are not near the ground as they would be during a dribble. The player's legs are positioned in a way that implies motion, but this does not specifically indicate a mid-dribble pose.",

      "question": "Are bold black outlines present around the basketball player, the ball, and other key elements such as the hoop and court?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features bold black outlines around the basketball player, the balls, and other elements like the court lines. These outlines are characteristic of comic-style illustrations and help define the shapes and edges clearly against the vibrant background.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible dynamic action lines around the player’s legs, arms, or the basketball to emphasize motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Dynamic action lines are visible around the player’s arms and legs in Image B. These lines radiate outward from the limbs and the basketballs, enhancing the sense of speed and motion typical in stylized sports illustrations.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is text overlaid on Image B in a retro-style font that reads 'SPORTS' along with some additional text above it. However, this does not suggest a fictional game title like 'Hoops Fever '87'. Instead, it appears more like a generic sports-related label.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is framed by a distinct comic panel border. This thick frame surrounds the entire illustration, giving it the appearance of a comic book or graphic novel panel, which is common in stylized sports art.",
