      "question": "Is there a keychain depicted in the image, featuring the character design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in question appears to be a small, three-dimensional figure of a cartoonish yellow creature with a duck-like bill and large eyes. It is positioned upright on a desk, suggesting it is not attached to anything like a keyring or chain that would typically indicate a keychain. The lack of any visible attachment points or chains further supports this conclusion.",

      "question": "Is the keychain placed on a wooden office desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface beneath the object has a wood grain texture, which is characteristic of wooden desks. Additionally, the surrounding objects such as books, glasses, and a chair are typical items found in an office setting. Therefore, it can be reasonably concluded that the object is indeed placed on a wooden office desk.",

      "question": "Are there books visible next to the keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To the left of the object, there is a stack of books with visible spines and pages. These books are clearly distinguishable by their rectangular shape, stacked arrangement, and the presence of text on the spines, which aligns with common knowledge about books.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are glasses visible next to the keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To the lower left of the object, there is a pair of eyeglasses with black frames and lenses. The distinct shape of the frames and the transparency of the lenses make them easily identifiable as glasses. This observation is consistent with the typical appearance of eyeglasses.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the object is correctly placed on the desk alongside books and glasses, it is not a keychain but rather a standalone figurine. However, its positioning relative to the other objects (books and glasses) is appropriate for a desk setup. Thus, while the term 'keychain' is inaccurate, the overall placement is correct.",
