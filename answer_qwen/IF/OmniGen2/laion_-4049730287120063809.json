      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are indeed subtle sparkling details visible on the bride’s dress, suggesting embellishments like sequins or beads that catch light.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The greenery in the background of Image B appears vibrant with enhanced colors, likely due to post-processing techniques that saturate and sharpen natural elements.

This assessment is based on the contrast between the sharpness of the subjects and the softness of the background.",
