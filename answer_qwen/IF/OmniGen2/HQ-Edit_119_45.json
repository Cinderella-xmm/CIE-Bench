      "question": "Has the overall style of the sculpture been transformed into a steampunk aesthetic, featuring industrial elements like gears, copper, and brass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture incorporates elements such as gears and clockwork patterns on the collar, which are characteristic of steampunk design. The use of metallic textures and intricate mechanical details further supports this analysis. These features align with the steampunk genre's emphasis on combining Victorian-era aesthetics with imagined steam-powered technology.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The headdress in Image B retains its original shape and silhouette but does not appear to be composed of brass gears or copper elements.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no visible mechanical wings attached to the back or shoulders of the figure in Image B. The image focuses on the head and upper torso of the figure, and there are no signs of additional mechanical structures or wings that would suggest such an addition.",

      "question": "Has the collar been redesigned with detailed clockwork patterns, including gears, cogs, or other mechanical components, replacing the original decorative elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collar has indeed been redesigned with detailed clockwork patterns. It includes gears and cogs, which are typical of steampunk designs. This redesign replaces the traditional Egyptian-style decorations seen in Image A, transforming the collar into a more industrial and mechanical appearance.",
