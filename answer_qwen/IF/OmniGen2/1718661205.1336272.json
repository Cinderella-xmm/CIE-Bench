      "question": "Is the military ship constructed entirely from LEGO bricks, with visible brick patterns and modular construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The military ship in Image B is clearly constructed from LEGO bricks, as evidenced by the visible brick patterns and modular construction. The structure of the ship shows distinct LEGO elements such as studs and interlocking pieces, which are characteristic of LEGO models. This conclusion is drawn from observing the uniformity and repetitive pattern typical of LEGO constructions.",

      "question": "Are the ocean waves depicted using blue LEGO bricks, forming a textured surface resembling water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ocean waves in Image B are depicted using blue LEGO bricks arranged to form a textured surface that resembles water. The arrangement of these bricks creates a sense of depth and texture, mimicking the appearance of waves. This analysis is based on the observation of the blue LEGO baseplate with its stud patterns designed to simulate water.",

      "question": "Is the boat’s deck composed of small, detailed LEGO accessories such as railings, panels, or equipment that replicate real deck features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boat’s deck in Image B includes small, detailed LEGO accessories such as railings, panels, and equipment that replicate real deck features. These details are evident through the presence of various LEGO pieces that are strategically placed to represent functional parts of a ship's deck. The reasoning is based on recognizing the complexity and specificity of the LEGO components used.",

      "question": "Are the life vest and shirt replaced with LEGO-textured clothing that retains their original colors but has a blocky, brick-like appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no person wearing a life vest or shirt; instead, there is a LEGO minifigure standing on the ship. Therefore, it is not possible for the clothing to have a blocky, brick-like appearance as described. The question assumes the presence of items that do not exist in this image, making the comparison invalid.",

      "question": "Is the LEGO diorama positioned on a minimalist shelf with a clean, uncluttered background that highlights the model's details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO diorama in Image B is indeed positioned on a minimalist shelf with a clean, uncluttered background. This setting highlights the model's details without any distractions. The analysis is based on observing the simplicity of the background and the focused presentation of the LEGO model on the shelf.",
