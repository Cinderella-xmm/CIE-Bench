    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a visible calendar layout element (such as a date, month, or decorative border) indicating the image is formatted as an art calendar page?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no visual cues in Image B that suggest the presence of a calendar layout element such as a date, month, or decorative border. The image is framed within a wooden border, but this appears to be an artistic choice rather than a calendar format. The content focuses on a figure and a bookshelf background without any calendar-specific indicators.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure exhibit characteristics of a half-cartoon style, such as stylized facial features, smooth lines, or exaggerated proportions while maintaining realism in other areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B exhibits characteristics typical of a half-cartoon style. The facial features are stylized with large eyes and simplified expressions, while the overall body proportions remain relatively realistic. The lines are smooth, and there's a clear emphasis on exaggerated features like the eyes and hair, which aligns with cartoon aesthetics.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the book in the foreground visibly longer than a normal book, with an elongated shape that exceeds typical proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The book in the foreground does not appear elongated beyond typical proportions. It looks like a standard-sized book that one would expect to find in a library setting. There are no visual cues suggesting it exceeds normal dimensions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sleeves display soft, flowing drapery with visible folds and gentle curvature, suggesting fabric texture and movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sleeves in Image B do not display soft, flowing drapery with visible folds and gentle curvature. Instead, they appear smooth and somewhat stiff, lacking the detailed texture and movement that would suggest fabric dynamics. This is consistent with the stylized nature of the image.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the buttons on the figure’s garment decorated with visible golden filigree patterns, such as delicate engravings or ornate designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buttons on the figure’s garment in Image B are simple and round, without any visible golden filigree patterns or ornate designs. They appear plain and functional, fitting the overall style of the image without additional decorative elements.",

      "question": "Are the library shelves stylized or positioned to form a wooden frame around the central figure and scene, creating a framed composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The library shelves in Image B are indeed stylized and positioned to form a wooden frame around the central figure and scene. This creates a framed composition that draws attention to the figure and the book she is holding, enhancing the visual focus on her.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are visual elements such as warm lighting, aged books, wooden surfaces, and focused reading posture present to enhance the scholarly atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B includes visual elements like aged books and a focused reading posture, it lacks warm lighting and wooden surfaces that would enhance a scholarly atmosphere. The lighting is even and bright, and the background is more stylized than realistic.",
