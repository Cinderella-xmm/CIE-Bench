        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse sculpture in Image B is clearly visible through a transparent box.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the showcase box have a seamless, flush closure suggesting a magnetic mechanism rather than a hinge or latch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The closure of the showcase box in Image B appears seamless and flush, suggesting the use of a magnetic mechanism rather than a hinge or latch. There are no visible hinges or latches, and the edges meet smoothly, indicating a design likely intended for a clean and elegant appearance. This reasoning is based on the absence of mechanical components typically associated with hinged closures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse sculpture in Image B is fully preserved and clearly visible through the transparent box without any distortion or occlusion. The transparency of the box ensures that all details of the sculpture can be observed directly. Comparing this with Image A, where the sculpture is not enclosed, confirms that the visibility remains intact despite the addition of the transparent enclosure.",
