      "question": "Are all structural elements of the Japanese house rendered as colored glass panels bounded by black lead lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Japanese house is depicted with a stained-glass style. The visual cues show that each part of the house, including walls, windows, and roof sections, is segmented into various colored glass pieces separated by black lines resembling lead came. This is characteristic of stained-glass art where different colors are held together by lead strips. The analysis is based on observing the segmentation and color boundaries within the structure.",

      "question": "Are the red trees replaced with stylized floral motifs made of red and green segmented glass pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are indeed stylized with red and green segments, typical of stained-glass floral motifs. Each leaf or cluster of leaves appears as a small, rounded piece of red glass, while the surrounding areas incorporate green glass to represent foliage. This observation aligns with common practices in stained-glass art for depicting natural elements.",

      "question": "Is the large red moon rendered using multiple overlapping or concentric gradient circles in shades of red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a large red moon. Instead, it focuses on the house and trees within a circular frame. Therefore, there are no overlapping or concentric gradient circles present in the image. The conclusion is drawn from the absence of such an element in the provided visual.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all major elements (house, trees, moon) clearly outlined with thick, black, continuous lines resembling lead came in stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house and trees are outlined with thick, black, continuous lines that resemble lead came, which is typical in stained-glass artwork. However, there is no moon present in this image. Thus, while the house and trees meet the criteria, the moon does not because it is absent. The comparison involves recognizing the presence or absence of elements and their stylistic treatment.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall scene maintain the original composition (house centered, trees flanking, moon above, water in foreground) while all elements are styled as stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a similar composition with the house centered and trees flanking it, but it lacks the moon and water elements seen in Image A. The scene is styled as stained glass, but the absence of the moon and water means the composition is not entirely preserved. The reasoning involves comparing the elements present in both images and noting the differences.",
