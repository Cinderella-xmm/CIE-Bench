      "question": "Is the character in the edited image depicted in 3D chibi style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in the edited image is depicted with exaggerated, cute features and a simplified design typical of chibi art. The proportions are not realistic; the head is larger compared to the body, and the overall figure has a rounded, soft appearance. This style is commonly used in 3D models for characters meant to appear adorable or childlike. The visual cues such as the large head, small limbs, and simplistic clothing details align with the characteristics of 3D chibi style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the character positioned within a Polaroid-style photo frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character is clearly positioned within a rectangular frame that resembles a Polaroid photo. The white border around the image mimics the classic design of a Polaroid photograph. This is evident from the clean lines and the way the image is presented as if it were a physical photo being held up.",

      "question": "Is the Polaroid paper being held by a visible human hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A human hand is visible in the lower left corner of the image, holding the Polaroid-style photo. The fingers are partially seen gripping the edge of the paper, which indicates that a real person is presenting the image. The skin texture and natural positioning of the fingers further confirm this observation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the character appear to be stepping out of the Polaroid frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character does not appear to be stepping out of the Polaroid frame. It is fully contained within the boundaries of the photo, with no part of the figure extending beyond the edges. The character's pose and position suggest it is simply standing inside the frame rather than interacting with its borders.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image effectively create the illusion of the character entering a real-world 3D space from the Polaroid photo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not create an illusion of the character entering a real-world 3D space from the Polaroid photo. The character remains entirely within the confines of the Polaroid frame, and there are no visual elements suggesting movement or interaction with the surrounding environment outside the frame. The hand holding the Polaroid adds realism but does not contribute to the illusion of the character exiting the photo.",
