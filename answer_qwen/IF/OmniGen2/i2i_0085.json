      "question": "Does the painting visibly extend beyond its frame to create a 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting is clearly contained within its frame with no visible extension beyond it. The edges of the painting are sharp and aligned with the frame's borders, indicating that there is no attempt to create a 3D effect by extending the image outside the frame. This conclusion is drawn from observing the clear distinction between the painting and the wall around it.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the elements from the painting visually merge into the room environment, such as appearing on the wall or floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The painting in Image B remains distinctly separate from the room environment. There are no visual elements from the painting, like trees or water, merging onto the wall or floor. The boundaries of the painting are well-defined, and the room maintains its own aesthetic independent of the artwork.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the transitions between the painting and the room environment smooth without any abrupt edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition between the painting and the room environment in Image B is not smooth. There is an abrupt edge where the painting ends and the wall begins. The frame acts as a clear boundary, separating the two without any blending or smoothing effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original elements of the painting, such as trees, water, and the sun, still identifiable in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original elements of the painting, including the trees, water, and the sun, remain clearly identifiable in Image B. These elements retain their form and color, allowing for easy recognition despite any potential editing. This conclusion is based on the consistent depiction of these features within the frame of the painting.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows in the extended portions of the painting match those in the actual room environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no extended portions of the painting in Image B; the painting is confined within its frame. Therefore, there is no comparison needed between the lighting and shadows of the painting and the room environment. The lighting in the room appears natural and does not interact with the painting in any way.",
