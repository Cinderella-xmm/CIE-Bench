        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the walls are made of large stone blocks with arched alcoves that house bookshelves.

      "question": "Is the fireplace in the image grander compared to the original one?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fireplace in Image B appears more integrated into the stone wall and has a gothic arch above it, which gives it a more elaborate and grand appearance. Comparing this with Image A, where the fireplace is simpler and framed by wood paneling, it is evident that the fireplace in Image B is indeed grander due to its design and surroundings.",

      "question": "Have the bookshelves been replaced with stone carvings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelves are still present but are now set within arched alcoves carved into the stone walls. While they are not entirely replaced with stone carvings, the integration of the shelves into the stone architecture gives them a carved appearance. Therefore, it can be said that the bookshelves have been transformed to fit the medieval theme.",
