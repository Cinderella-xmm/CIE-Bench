      "question": "Is the cityscape and car fully enclosed within a transparent, cube-shaped resin casing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cityscape and car are visibly enclosed within a transparent cube. The cube's edges and corners are clearly defined, and it appears to be made of a material like resin due to its smooth, glossy surface and the way it refracts light. This conclusion is drawn from observing the clear boundaries and the reflection on the cube's surface.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car feature a sleek, futuristic design with metallic and highly reflective surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The car in Image B has a sleek design with sharp lines and curves, typical of futuristic vehicles. Its metallic surface reflects light, indicating high reflectivity. These characteristics suggest a modern and advanced aesthetic, which aligns with common features of futuristic car designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers visibly reduced in size compared to the original image, enhancing the sense of depth and scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers appear smaller relative to the car and other elements inside the cube compared to their size in Image A. This reduction enhances the sense of depth and scale, making the scene look more like a miniature model. The comparison involves noting the proportionate difference between the car and buildings in both images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the skyscrapers have small, distinct points of light resembling micro LEDs on their windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The windows of the skyscrapers in Image B have small points of light that resemble micro LEDs. These lights are distinct and evenly spaced, suggesting an intentional design choice to mimic illuminated windows in a scaled-down model. This observation is based on the visual appearance of the windows and their lighting pattern.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the trees feature finely detailed, miniature foliage with rich green coloration that contrasts with the surrounding urban structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B have detailed, miniature foliage with rich green coloration. Their small size and intricate details stand out against the urban backdrop, creating a contrast that highlights their presence. This analysis is based on the visible texture and color of the leaves in relation to the surrounding structures.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the resin cube completely transparent with no visible color distortion or opacity, allowing full view of the interior scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The resin cube in Image B is completely transparent, as evidenced by the clear visibility of all interior elements without any noticeable distortion or opacity. The transparency allows for an unobstructed view of the car, trees, and cityscape inside the cube.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the car positioned in the same relative location on the street as in the original image, maintaining its orientation and alignment with the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is not positioned on a street but rather placed on a grassy area within the resin cube. This differs from Image A, where the car is aligned with the road. Therefore, the car's location and orientation have changed significantly between the two images.",
