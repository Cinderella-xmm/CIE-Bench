        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) features a sculpture resembling a brain with intricate, wavy textures and the phrase 'profound musings' inscribed on it. There is no visual evidence of a handbag in the image. The object present is clearly a brain-like structure mounted on a wooden base, which does not resemble or suggest the presence of a handbag.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the handbag in the edited image have intricate, wavy, and layered textures similar to the brain sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there is no handbag present in the edited image, it is not possible for it to have any texture similar to the brain sculpture. The analysis is based solely on the visible elements within Image B, which do not include a handbag.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the handbag in the edited image rendered in shades of brown and beige, matching the color scheme of the brain sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As there is no handbag in the edited image, it cannot be rendered in any color scheme. The colors observed are those of the brain sculpture and its wooden base, but these do not pertain to a non-existent handbag.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that there is no handbag in the edited image, it cannot exhibit three-dimensional qualities or volume. The three-dimensionality observed is that of the brain sculpture, not a handbag.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without a handbag present in the edited image, it cannot integrate with or disrupt the aesthetic coherence of the organic design style of the brain sculpture. The focus remains on the brain sculpture itself, which maintains its own aesthetic integrity.",
