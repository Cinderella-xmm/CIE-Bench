    "Question": "Q1: Does the dog and banana appear as a single unified form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and banana are clearly distinct objects with no visual blending or merging that would suggest they are part of a single form. The dog is positioned behind the banana, and both maintain their individual shapes and textures. There is no indication of any manipulation that combines them into one entity.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the blended form retain a realistic appearance without obvious signs of manipulation?",
    "explanation": "Since there is no actual blending or merging of the dog and banana in Image B, the question of retaining a realistic appearance through blending does not apply. Both the dog and banana appear natural and unaltered, maintaining their realistic appearances independently.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the transition between the dog and banana smooth and seamless?",
    "explanation": "There is no transition between the dog and banana in Image B; they remain separate entities. A smooth and seamless transition would imply some form of visual merging or blending, which is not present here. Therefore, it cannot be considered smooth or seamless.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the proportions and scale of the blended form consistent and realistic?",
    "explanation": "As there is no blending or merging of the dog and banana in Image B, the concept of proportion and scale consistency for a blended form is not applicable. Each object retains its own realistic proportions and scale relative to each other and the environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the lighting and shadows on the blended form match the original lighting conditions?",
    "explanation": "The lighting and shadows on both the dog and banana in Image B appear consistent with what would be expected under natural outdoor lighting conditions. Since there is no blending, the lighting remains true to each object individually, matching the original conditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
