        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible phone or stand. The focus is on a cup of coffee placed on a wooden table with a seaside background. This indicates that the phone and stand have been removed. The analysis is based solely on the visual content of Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a cup of coffee on a wooden table with a blurred background of the sea and beach, suggesting a seaside café setting. This change in scene is evident from the new elements like the ocean, sand, and outdoor furniture, which are not present in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tabletop in Image B has a warm glow and highlights that suggest sunlight reflecting off its surface. Additionally, the blurred background includes sparkling light effects consistent with sunlight reflecting off sea waves. These observations align with typical characteristics of a seaside setting.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a wooden table with a cup of coffee, a chair, and another table in the background. These elements are common in café settings and, combined with the seaside backdrop, create an atmosphere typical of a seaside café.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of Image B maintains a realistic perspective with the cup of coffee centered on the table and the background elements appropriately scaled and positioned for a seaside café setting. The depth of field blurring the background also enhances the realism of the scene.",
