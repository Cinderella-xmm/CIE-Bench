      "question": "Does the entire image show characteristics of Ukiyo-e style, with flat colors and clear lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image exhibits a stylized appearance with bold outlines and uniform color blocks, which are hallmarks of Ukiyo-e art. The lack of gradient shading and the emphasis on clean, distinct lines further support this observation. These visual cues align with the traditional techniques used in Ukiyo-e prints.",

      "question": "Are there visible traditional Japanese painting brush strokes on the baseball bat and grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the image, the depiction of the baseball bats and grass lacks the texture and variation typically associated with brush strokes. Instead, the elements appear as solid shapes with defined edges, suggesting a digital or graphic design approach rather than traditional brushwork.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the shapes of the baseball bats and grass been maintained while adapting to the Ukiyo-e style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shapes of the baseball bats and grass remain recognizable and consistent with their real-world counterparts. However, they have been simplified and stylized to fit the Ukiyo-e aesthetic, retaining their essential forms while adopting the artistic conventions of the style.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the grass been rendered with traditional Japanese brush strokes to reflect the Ukiyo-e style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grass in the image is depicted using solid green shapes with sharp edges, lacking the fluidity and texture that would be expected from traditional brush strokes. This suggests a more modern interpretation of Ukiyo-e rather than an adherence to traditional techniques.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the baseball bat display traditional Japanese brush strokes, adhering to the Ukiyo-e style requirements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The baseball bats in the image are shown as smooth, solid objects without any visible brush stroke textures. While they fit within the overall Ukiyo-e style through their use of flat colors and clear lines, they do not exhibit the specific brushwork characteristic of traditional Japanese paintings.",
