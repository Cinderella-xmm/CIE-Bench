      "question": "Are the calendar pages arranged into a tidy pile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar pages are scattered across the desk surface in an overlapping manner. There is no indication of a neat or organized arrangement that would suggest a tidy pile. The pages appear randomly placed, which aligns with common practices when casually laying out multiple items for viewing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the handwritten notes and highlighted dates still present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, the handwritten notes such as 'Birthday,' 'Wedding,' 'No work,' and 'Quiet day' along with highlighted dates like circles and crosses remain visible. Comparing this to Image A, these elements appear consistent in both images, suggesting they have not been altered or removed during editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the calendar pages and desk surface display convincing textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The calendar pages in Image B exhibit a paper-like texture with slight creases and shadows that suggest realism. The desk surface also appears smooth with a wood grain pattern, typical of wooden desks. These visual cues combined with common knowledge about paper and wood textures contribute to a convincing representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there evidence of lighting and shadow depth creating a realistic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows subtle shadows cast by the calendar pages onto each other and the desk surface. This suggests a light source from above, creating depth and dimensionality. Such lighting effects are consistent with real-world scenarios, enhancing the image's realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the colors and styles of the handwritten notes and highlighted dates been preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handwritten notes and highlighted dates in Image B maintain their original colors and styles. For instance, the blue circle around 'Birthday,' the red text for 'Wedding,' and the green highlight for 'Gym' are consistent with Image A. This preservation indicates careful editing to retain these visual elements.",
