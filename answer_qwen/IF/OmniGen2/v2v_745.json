      "question": "Are the backgrounds of all stickers transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining the stickers in Image B, it is clear that each sticker has a white border and no visible background elements behind the characters. This suggests that the backgrounds of all stickers are transparent. The absence of any overlapping or background details further supports this conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stickers arranged in a 3x3 grid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers in Image B are arranged in a grid format. Counting the rows and columns, there are 3 rows and 4 columns, making it a 3x4 grid rather than a 3x3 grid. Therefore, the arrangement does not match a 3x3 grid.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each sticker appears to have a square shape with equal width and height proportions. Observing the edges and comparing them visually confirms that they maintain a 1:1 aspect ratio, which is characteristic of square shapes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers in Image B depict characters in a Chibi-style, characterized by their large heads, small bodies, and simplified features. The colors used are lively and bold, reminiscent of Ghibli's animation style. Each character is uniformly styled in this manner, supporting the description.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each sticker portrays a distinct action, emotion, or theme related to travel. For example, some characters are holding phones, others are looking surprised or happy, and one appears to be drinking from a cup. These variations suggest different travel-related scenarios or emotions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All characters in the stickers are fully depicted with complete features such as heads, bodies, limbs, and facial expressions. There are no missing parts or incomplete depictions of the characters, indicating that they are all fully rendered.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a consistent white border around each sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each sticker in Image B is surrounded by a consistent white border. This border is uniform in thickness and clearly separates each sticker from the others, providing a clean and organized appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "There are no disconnected or unrelated elements within the stickers. Each sticker focuses solely on a single character and their associated actions or emotions, without any extraneous or unrelated components.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "There are no texts present within the stickers themselves. The text at the top of Image B is not part of the stickers but rather an external label. Since there are no texts within the stickers, the question of accuracy does not apply.",
