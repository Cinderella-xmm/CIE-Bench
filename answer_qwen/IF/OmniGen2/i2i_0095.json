      "question": "Has the word “Shine” been added to the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror clearly displays the word 'Shine' in a bright, glowing font. This is not a typical feature of mirrors and suggests that it has been intentionally added as part of the image editing process. The presence of this text is visually distinct and does not naturally occur on standard mirrors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Shine' appears to be centered within the mirror's frame. It is aligned horizontally and vertically in a way that draws attention directly to the middle of the mirror, which is a common practice for emphasizing text in design.",

      "question": "Does the word “Shine” appear to have a backlit glowing effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Shine' in Image B emits a bright, warm light that contrasts with the neutral tones of the bathroom. This glowing effect is characteristic of backlit signage or neon lights, suggesting that the text is designed to stand out and catch the viewer's eye.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The font used for 'Shine' is simple and sans-serif, which aligns well with modern and minimalistic design principles. The warm glow of the text adds a subtle contrast without overwhelming the clean lines and neutral colors of the bathroom, making it a harmonious addition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Shine' enhances the bathroom's aesthetic by adding a focal point without disrupting the minimalist design. Its central placement and soft glow complement the space rather than detract from it, maintaining a balanced and cohesive look.",
