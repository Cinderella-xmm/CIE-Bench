      "question": "Does the dog and banana appear as a single unified form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and banana are clearly distinct objects with no visual blending or merging that would suggest they are part of a single form. The dog is positioned behind the banana, and both maintain their individual shapes and textures. There is no indication of any manipulation that combines them into one entity.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the blended form retain a realistic appearance without obvious signs of manipulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there is no actual blending or merging of the dog and banana in Image B, the question of retaining a realistic appearance through blending does not apply. Both the dog and banana appear natural and unaltered, maintaining their realistic appearances independently.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition between the dog and banana smooth and seamless?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no transition between the dog and banana in Image B; they remain separate entities. A smooth and seamless transition would imply some form of visual merging or blending, which is not present here. Therefore, it cannot be considered smooth or seamless.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and scale of the blended form consistent and realistic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As there is no blending or merging of the dog and banana in Image B, the concept of proportion and scale consistency for a blended form is not applicable. Each object retains its own realistic proportions and scale relative to each other and the environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the blended form match the original lighting conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadows on both the dog and banana in Image B appear consistent with what would be expected under natural outdoor lighting conditions. Since there is no blending, the lighting remains true to each object individually, matching the original conditions.",
