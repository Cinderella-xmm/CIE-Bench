      "question": "Do the book pages extend out of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is open and positioned in such a way that its pages do not visibly extend beyond the edges of the image frame. The visible portion of the book fits entirely within the boundaries of the image. This conclusion is drawn by observing the spatial relationship between the book and the surrounding wooden surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a subtle curved shadow on the extended pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the pages do not extend out of the frame, as established in Q1, there are no extended pages to analyze for shadows. Therefore, it is not possible for there to be a subtle curved shadow on non-existent extended pages.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the editing convey the impression that the book is unfolding toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The book in Image B appears to be open at a typical angle, with no visual cues suggesting an unusual unfolding motion towards the viewer. The pages seem static and naturally laid open, consistent with how books are typically viewed. There is no evidence of dynamic movement or perspective distortion that would imply unfolding.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the extended pages visually consistent with the original book pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As previously determined, there are no extended pages in Image B. Therefore, there is nothing to compare with the original book pages in terms of visual consistency. The analysis is based on the absence of any extended pages.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a seamless transition between the original and extended parts of the book pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes  \n```",
      "explanation": "Given that there are no extended pages in Image B, there cannot be a transition between original and extended parts. The entire visible portion of the book maintains a uniform appearance without any indication of extension or alteration.",
