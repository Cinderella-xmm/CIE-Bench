      "question": "Is the mannequin now rendered as a stone sculpture rather than a metallic or plastic figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mannequin appears to have a matte, textured surface that resembles stone. This is evident from the lack of reflective qualities typically associated with metallic or plastic materials. The texture and coloration suggest an aged stone appearance, which aligns with common characteristics of stone sculptures. Therefore, based on these visual cues, it can be concluded that the mannequin has been rendered as a stone sculpture.",

      "question": "Are delicate floral and paisley motifs carved into the stone surface of the saree and body, reflecting the original embroidery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the saree and the mannequin's body exhibit intricate patterns that resemble floral and paisley designs. These patterns are integrated into the stone surface, suggesting they are carved rather than embroidered. Comparing this with Image A, where the patterns were part of the fabric's embroidery, it is clear that in Image B, the same motifs have been translated into stone carvings, maintaining the design's essence but altering its medium.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mannequin in Image B is positioned in a calm and composed manner, with closed eyes and a gentle hand gesture. This pose is reminiscent of classical Indian stone sculptures, which often depict figures in serene and meditative postures. The overall stance and expression convey a sense of tranquility typical of such artistic representations.",

      "question": "Have the regal jewelry elements been converted into intricately carved stone details instead of remaining as separate accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jewelry pieces, such as the necklace and earrings, appear to be seamlessly integrated into the stone surface of the mannequin. They lack the distinct separateness seen in Image A, where the jewelry was clearly defined as separate accessories. Instead, they seem to be part of the carving, indicating a conversion into stone details.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the stone surface show a weathered, aged texture consistent with an ancient sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the mannequin in Image B does not exhibit significant signs of weathering or aging. While it has a stone-like texture, it lacks the deep cracks, discoloration, and erosion typically associated with ancient sculptures. The surface appears relatively smooth and uniform, suggesting a more modern interpretation of stone rather than an ancient one.",

      "question": "Is the sareeâ€™s draping and silhouette accurately maintained in stone form, with folds and pleats clearly defined through carving?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the saree's draping and silhouette are well-preserved in the stone form. The folds and pleats are distinctly carved, maintaining the fluidity and elegance of the original fabric as seen in Image A. The carving effectively captures the complexity of the saree's arrangement, demonstrating a high level of craftsmanship.",
