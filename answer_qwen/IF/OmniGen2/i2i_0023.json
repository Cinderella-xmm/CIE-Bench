      "question": "Has the photo been converted into a minimalist flat illustration-style sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image appears to be a flat illustration with simplified shapes and solid colors, resembling a sticker. The edges are clean and the overall style is minimalistic, which aligns with the characteristics of a flat illustration-style sticker.",

      "question": "Are the boy and all bird outlines clearly present in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only the boy's outline is clearly present as part of the minimalist flat illustration. There are no bird outlines visible in this image, indicating that the birds have been removed or not included in the illustration.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have block colors been used for the boy's skin tones and the birds' feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boy's skin tones and the shirt color appear as block colors without gradients or shading, which is typical for flat illustrations. However, since there are no birds in the image, it cannot be determined if block colors were used for their feathers.",

      "question": "Is the background completely removed from the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is completely white and lacks any detail or texture, suggesting that it has been removed to focus solely on the subject of the illustration.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the boy’s head been slightly enlarged and the birds shrunk to achieve a neatly arranged composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there are no birds in Image B, it is not possible to assess whether they have been shrunk. However, the boy’s head does not appear disproportionately enlarged compared to his body within the context of the illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Has a thick white outline been added around the boy and birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is a thick white outline surrounding the boy in Image B, which is characteristic of stickers designed to stand out against various backgrounds.",

    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is entirely white, which suggests that it is not transparent. Transparent backgrounds typically do not display any color and allow underlying content to show through.",
