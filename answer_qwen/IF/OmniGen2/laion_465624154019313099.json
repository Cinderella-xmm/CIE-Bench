      "question": "Is the edited image a two-panel comic strip with the title “Cake Conundrum!” displayed at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image is clearly divided into two panels, each with a speech bubble containing text. The second panel's speech bubble includes the phrase 'Cake Conundrum,' which suggests it could be part of a title or theme for the comic strip. However, there is no overarching title at the very top of the image that explicitly states 'Cake Conundrum!' as a title.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the cake has been anthropomorphized with large, expressive eyes added to its surface in both panels. Additionally, strawberries are placed on top of the cake in a manner that resembles a hat, enhancing the playful and animated character of the cake.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "In the first panel, are the cake creature’s eyes wide open, showing surprise, and is the dialogue “Who ate my delicious corner?!” present in a speech bubble?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the first panel of the edited image, the cake creature's eyes are indeed wide open, conveying an expression of surprise. The accompanying dialogue in the speech bubble reads 'Who ate my mree delicioums corner?!', which closely matches the given question's description, albeit with a slight spelling variation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "In Panel 2, does the cake creature appear to be shaking its head, has the dialogue “No more free bites, time for dessert defense!” been added, and are strawberries and garnishes arranged as bodyguards and a shield?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second panel, the cake creature does not appear to be shaking its head; instead, it maintains a similar posture to the first panel. The dialogue in the speech bubble reads 'Cake Conundrum free bitks, time for desssert defense!', which is close but not identical to the provided statement. There are no visible strawberries or garnishes arranged as bodyguards or a shield around the cake.",
