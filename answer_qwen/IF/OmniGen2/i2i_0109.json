      "question": "Has the character been successfully transformed into a plastic figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character appears as a three-dimensional object with a smooth surface and uniform lighting typical of a plastic figurine. The details such as armor and cape are simplified and stylized in a way that is consistent with how collectible figurines are designed. The overall appearance lacks the photorealistic textures and complex lighting seen in live-action characters, supporting the conclusion that it has been transformed into a figurine.",

      "question": "Is the plastic figurine still in the same standing pose as the original character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B maintains a similar stance to the character in Image A, with one arm slightly bent holding an object (the hammer) and the other arm relaxed by its side. Both images show the character in a confident, upright position, indicating that the pose has been preserved in the transformation to a figurine.",

      "question": "Is the plastic figurine placed on a desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figurine standing on a circular base which is illuminated from below, creating a glow effect. This setup is commonly used for display purposes, often found on desks or shelves. The presence of what appears to be a wooden surface beneath the base suggests that the figurine is indeed placed on a desk.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there lighting effects visibly added around the plastic figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable glow emanating from the base of the figurine, casting light onto the surrounding area. Additionally, the hammer held by the figurine emits a bright blue light, which adds to the dramatic effect. These lighting elements are not natural but rather artistic additions to enhance the visual appeal of the figurine.",

      "question": "Does the plastic figurine accurately maintain the appearance details like costume and accessories from the original character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the figurine retains key elements of the character's appearance, including the detailed armor, red cape, and the hammer. However, some details may be simplified due to the nature of the figurine design. Despite these minor differences, the overall costume and accessories are faithfully represented, maintaining the character's iconic look.",
