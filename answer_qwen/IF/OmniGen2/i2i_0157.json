      "question": "Is the front wheel of the skateboard visibly extending out from the bottom edge of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front wheel of the skateboard is clearly visible and extends beyond the bottom edge of the frame. This can be observed by noting that the wheel appears larger and more prominent compared to its usual position on a standard skateboard. The visual cue of the wheel's size and position relative to the rest of the skateboard suggests it has been edited to extend outward.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the skateboard show a noticeable tilt forward, indicating enhanced speed and power?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skateboard in Image B does not exhibit a noticeable tilt forward. Instead, it appears level with the ground, which contradicts the idea of enhanced speed or power. The lack of tilt suggests that the skateboard is either stationary or moving at a normal pace without any additional force applied.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the boy's body posture and stance aligned in a way that suggests he is actively performing a powerful movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boy's body posture in Image B shows him leaning slightly forward with his arms extended for balance. This stance is typical for someone maintaining control while skateboarding but does not necessarily indicate a powerful movement. There are no signs of dynamic action such as crouching or shifting weight that would suggest an active powerful movement.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any additional elements or changes made to the image aside from making the skateboard's front wheel pop out and enhancing the action moment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Aside from the exaggerated front wheel of the skateboard, there do not appear to be any other significant changes or additional elements in Image B. The background, lighting, and other objects remain consistent with what would be expected in a typical street scene. Therefore, the focus remains solely on the altered skateboard feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the front wheel of the skateboard proportionately sized and realistically positioned as it leaves the bottom of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The front wheel of the skateboard in Image B is disproportionately large and positioned in a way that defies realistic proportions. It extends far beyond the typical dimensions of a skateboard wheel and appears to be floating rather than attached naturally to the board. This unrealistic positioning indicates an artificial alteration rather than a natural occurrence.",
