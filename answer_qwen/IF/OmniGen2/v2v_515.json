      "question": "Are there ten Russian nesting dolls in total, with five dolls representing each person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are five Russian nesting dolls visible. Each doll is distinct in size and design, but there are no indications of additional dolls that would bring the total to ten. The question suggests a specific number and pairing which is not supported by the visual evidence.",

      "question": "Are the Russian nesting dolls placed on a sophisticated wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls in Image B are indeed placed on a surface that appears to be a wooden table. The wood grain and finish suggest it is a polished and possibly sophisticated piece of furniture. This conclusion is drawn from the texture and sheen visible on the surface.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are vibrant board game boxes visible in the backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B shows shelves filled with colorful boxes that resemble board games. These boxes have bright colors and designs typical of board games, indicating they are likely board games or similar items.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the Russian nesting dolls exhibit chibi-style features such as large heads and simplified designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Russian nesting dolls in Image B have exaggeratedly large heads relative to their bodies and simplified facial features, which are characteristic of chibi-style art. This style is often used for cute and appealing designs, matching the appearance of these dolls.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image have a horizontal aspect ratio of 3:2?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the aspect ratio, one would compare the width to the height of the image. Image B appears to be square-shaped, suggesting an aspect ratio closer to 1:1 rather than 3:2. A 3:2 ratio would imply the image is wider than it is tall, which does not seem to be the case here.",
