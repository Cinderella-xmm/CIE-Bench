    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all architectural elements of the building rendered with sharp, angular edges characteristic of a paper-cut art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural elements of the building are depicted with clean lines and sharp edges. The style is reminiscent of paper-cut art due to the flat colors and lack of shading or gradient, which gives a two-dimensional appearance typical of such art forms. This analysis is based on observing the uniformity and precision of the lines in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the window frames and plant motifs enhanced with visible gold foil-like accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no visible gold foil-like accents on the window frames or plant motifs. The windows and plants appear as part of the same flat color scheme without any metallic or reflective qualities that would suggest gold foil. This conclusion is drawn from the absence of such features in the visual cues provided.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the entrance awning colored in a bold crimson hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one of the postcards clearly shows an entrance awning colored in a bold crimson hue. This can be identified by the distinct red color against the otherwise muted tones of the building. Comparing this with common knowledge of color descriptions confirms it as a bold crimson.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background of each postcard rendered with a textured cream-colored paper appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of each postcard in Image B appears to have a textured cream-colored paper look. This is inferred from the slight variations in the cream color and the subtle texture that mimics the appearance of paper. This observation aligns with the characteristics of a textured paper background.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does each postcard feature a geometric arch border around its edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each postcard in Image B has a geometric arch border around its edge. This is evident from the semi-circular shapes at the top corners of each postcard, which form an arch-like border. This design choice is consistent with decorative borders often seen in artistic renderings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the postcards presented without any visible frame or border, maintaining a clean, borderless edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows postcards with clear borders, including the geometric arches mentioned earlier. There is no indication of a borderless edge; instead, the edges are defined by these decorative elements. Therefore, the postcards are not presented without any visible frame or border.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there exactly three separate postcards displayed, each showing a variation of the hotel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays only two postcards, each showing a variation of the hotel. There is no third postcard present in the image. This conclusion is based on a direct count of the postcards visible in the image, which does not match the statement about three separate postcards.",
