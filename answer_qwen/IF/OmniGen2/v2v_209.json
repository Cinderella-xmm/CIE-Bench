      "question": "Does the edited image feature a kawaii enamel pin design of the wooden rocking chair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a wooden rocking chair with a simple and clean design. There are no visual cues indicating that it is a kawaii enamel pin design. The chair appears as a full-sized object rather than a small, stylized pin. Therefore, based on the visual information and common sense, the image does not feature a kawaii enamel pin design.",

      "question": "Are the outlines of the pin design shiny and metallic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outlines of the chair in the edited image do not appear shiny or metallic. They have a smooth and uniform appearance consistent with a digital illustration or rendering of a wooden chair. Metallic shine would typically involve reflective highlights and gradients, which are not present here. Thus, the outlines are not shiny and metallic.",

      "question": "Does the pin design incorporate bold and vivid enamel colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in the edited image are natural wood tones, which are not bold or vivid as one would expect from an enamel design. Enamel colors are usually bright and saturated, whereas the chair's coloration is subdued and realistic. Hence, the pin design does not incorporate bold and vivid enamel colors.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents the chair in a straightforward manner without additional details beyond its basic structure. It lacks any embellishments or intricate designs that might be associated with a more complex pin design. Therefore, the design is indeed simple, with no extra details added.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mockup in the edited image is presented against a plain white background, and the format appears to be square, matching the dimensions of the image provided. This presentation style is typical for showcasing objects clearly and without distractions. Thus, the mockup is indeed in a square format with a plain white background.",
