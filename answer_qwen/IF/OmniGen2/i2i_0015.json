      "question": "Is the main visual a monochrome side portrait in a screen-printed style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The main visual in Image B is a side portrait of an individual with monochrome coloring, which suggests it uses only black and white. The style appears to be screen-printed due to the high contrast and bold lines typical of this printing method. This conclusion is drawn from observing the stark contrast and the texture that resembles screen printing.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typography used for the concert details in Image B has an irregular and somewhat chaotic appearance, consistent with punk-style design elements.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
