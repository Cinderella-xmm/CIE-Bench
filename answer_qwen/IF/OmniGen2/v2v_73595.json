      "question": "Are the pink and grey stick figures depicted as stylized, robed monastic figures in similar poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pink and grey stick figures in Image B are depicted in simple, stylized forms without any indication of monastic robes. The figures maintain a basic human shape with no additional details that would suggest they are robed or monastic. Therefore, based on the visual cues alone, there is no evidence to support the depiction of these figures as stylized, robed monastic figures.",

      "question": "Has the 'CFSPS' logo been transformed into an ornate, gilded seal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'CFSPS' logo has indeed been transformed into an ornate, gilded seal. This can be observed by the intricate design and golden coloration surrounding the text, which is characteristic of seals used in official documents or historical contexts. Comparing this with Image A, where the logo is simpler and lacks such embellishments, it's clear that the transformation has occurred.",

      "question": "Is the 'Sex Position Cards' text rendered in elaborate gothic script within the red banner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'Sex Position Cards' text in Image B is not rendered in elaborate gothic script; instead, it appears in a modern, sans-serif font within the red banner. Gothic script typically features complex, decorative letterforms, which are not present here. Thus, based on the visual analysis of the text style, the answer is clear.",

      "question": "Does the overall style resemble an ancient, illuminated manuscript on aged parchment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall style of Image B does resemble an ancient, illuminated manuscript on aged parchment. This is evident from the background texture that mimics aged paper and the use of gold and red colors for the seal and banner, which are common in historical manuscripts. The combination of these elements creates an impression of antiquity and elegance typical of illuminated manuscripts.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pink and grey colors have not been replaced with appropriate colors for monastic robes and parchment. The figures remain in their original pink and grey hues, and the background maintains a beige tone resembling parchment but does not reflect specific monastic robe colors. Therefore, the colors have not been altered to suit monastic themes.",
