        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is rendered in a monochromatic sepia tone, which is characteristic of Victorian-era illustrations.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In front of the man, instead of a typewriter, there is a large, leather-bound book.
