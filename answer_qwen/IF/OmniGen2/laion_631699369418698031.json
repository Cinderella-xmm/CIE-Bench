      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the totem pole now presented as a miniature scene within a confined space, suggesting a scaled-down 3D environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the totem pole is depicted within a small, enclosed space that includes miniature plants and a glass dome. The size of the totem pole relative to the surrounding elements suggests it has been scaled down to fit this environment. This setup resembles a diorama or terrarium, which are commonly used to create miniature 3D scenes. The confined space and the presence of other small-scale elements support the conclusion that this is indeed a miniature scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the totem pole encased within a transparent cylindrical structure that resembles a glass dome. The transparency and the curved shape of the enclosure allow for an unobstructed view of the totem pole and its surroundings, confirming that it is indeed enclosed in such a manner.",

      "question": "Are there tiny ferns and moss visible at the base of the totem pole inside the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the base of the dome in Image B, there are visible green plants that resemble ferns and patches of moss. These elements are small in scale and positioned around the base of the totem pole, indicating they are part of the miniature scene designed to mimic a natural environment.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the totem pole in Image B, there is a butterfly perched on the structure. Its wings are spread out, and its colors are distinct, making it easily identifiable as a butterfly. This detail adds to the naturalistic theme of the miniature scene.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B is dominated by earthy tones, including various shades of brown from the wood texture of the totem pole and greens from the plants and moss. These colors are typical of natural environments and contribute to the overall aesthetic of the image, which aims to evoke a sense of nature and organic materials.",
