      "question": "Is the vase now composed of clear, faceted crystal material that mimics the original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is clearly made of a clear, faceted crystal material. The visual cues such as the transparency, the way light interacts with the facets, and the sharp reflections suggest that it is crystal. The shape of the vase in Image B retains the general outline and structure seen in ornate vases, including a wide body and a narrower base. This analysis is based on the visual properties of crystal and the structural design typical of decorative vases.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the decorative panels on the vase replaced with etched abstract floral patterns in crystal, rather than painted figures or scenes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a crystal vase with no painted figures or scenes. Instead, the surface appears to have etched patterns that resemble abstract floral designs. These patterns are consistent with techniques used in crystal art where etching creates intricate designs. Comparing this with Image A, which features painted panels with figures, it's evident that the decorative style has been changed from painted to etched patterns.",

      "question": "Have all the flowers been replaced with pastel-colored, translucent, intricately carved crystal blossoms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flowers in Image B are pastel-colored and appear translucent, with an intricately carved appearance typical of crystal craftsmanship. They lack the natural texture and color depth of real flowers, instead mimicking the delicate and luminous qualities often associated with crystal art. This contrasts with Image A, where the flowers are vibrant and realistic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the vase placed on a minimalist, flat, reflective mirrored pedestal that shows a clear reflection of the vase and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B places the crystal vase on a flat, reflective surface that acts like a mirror, showing a clear reflection of the vase and flowers. This minimalist pedestal enhances the clarity and elegance of the crystal, focusing attention on the vase and its contents. There is no such reflective feature in Image A, which has a more traditional setting.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crystal vase maintain the same overall shape, size, and structural features (such as handles and foot) as the original ornate vase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite being made of crystal, the vase in Image B maintains the same overall shape, size, and structural features as the original ornate vase in Image A. It has a similar wide body, narrow base, and structural integrity, indicating that the transformation into crystal did not alter these fundamental aspects.",
