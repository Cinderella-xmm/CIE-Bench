    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior statue exhibits a distinct blocky structure with visible lines and shapes characteristic of LEGO bricks. The body, limbs, and head are segmented into rectangular and square forms that align with the typical appearance of LEGO constructions. This observation is based on the visual cues of the uniform brick-like patterns covering the entire figure, which is consistent with how LEGO models are assembled.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "The statue in Image B predominantly features shades of brown and tan, which can be observed in the uniform coloration across its surface. These colors are typical for LEGO bricks designed to mimic natural materials like wood or stone. There are no other prominent colors present, supporting the conclusion that the primary palette is limited to these earthy tones.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "The armor sections such as the chest plate, shoulder pads, and leg guards in Image B appear to be made of smooth LEGO bricks without any intricate surface texture. The visual cues suggest a uniform, flat surface typical of LEGO pieces used for large, solid areas in models. This analysis is based on the lack of detailed patterns or textures that would indicate otherwise.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:"
    "explanation": "The ornamental details like the headdress, necklace, and carvings on the torso in Image B do not exhibit textured LEGO bricks with visible patterns. Instead, they maintain a smooth appearance similar to the rest of the armor sections. This suggests that while these elements are part of the design, they are not constructed using textured bricks but rather simple, smooth LEGO pieces.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:"
    "explanation": "The LEGO statue in Image B is indeed positioned on a plain white pedestal with no decorative elements. The gallery environment around it includes framed artworks on the walls and track lighting overhead, which are common features in art galleries. This setting provides context that supports the placement and presentation of the statue as an exhibit.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:"
    "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the LEGO statue retains the same standing posture, facial expression, and proportional dimensions as the original wooden warrior. The stance, orientation, and overall form are preserved despite the change in material from carved wood to LEGO bricks. This consistency is evident through the alignment of key features such as the position of the arms, legs, and head.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7:"
    "explanation": "The statue in Image B is visibly constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, as evidenced by the clear segmentation and blocky structure throughout the figure. There are no continuous surfaces resembling carved wood; instead, the entire model is composed of individual LEGO pieces. This is apparent from the distinct edges and lines that define each brick, contrasting with the smooth, continuous surfaces typically found in carved wooden sculptures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
