      "question": "Are the stork's feathers replaced with metallic plates, such as riveted or segmented metal surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stork's feathers appear to be replaced with metallic plates. The visual cues include the segmented and riveted appearance of the feathers, which resemble mechanical components rather than natural plumage. This is consistent with a Steampunk aesthetic where organic elements are often replaced with metallic ones. The texture and sheen of the 'feathers' further support this conclusion.",

      "question": "Are the nest materials composed entirely of cogs, gears, and mechanical parts instead of natural twigs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nest materials in Image B are composed of cogs, gears, and mechanical parts instead of natural twigs. This can be observed from the intricate arrangement of metallic gears and mechanical components that form the structure of the nest. These elements are clearly artificial and industrial, contrasting with the natural materials typically used for nests. The integration of these mechanical parts into the nest design aligns with the Steampunk theme.",

      "question": "Are copper-colored pipes visibly integrated along the roofline of the wooden house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Copper-colored pipes are visibly integrated along the roofline of the wooden house in Image B. The pipes have a distinct metallic color and texture that stands out against the wooden background. Their placement along the roofline suggests they are part of the house's design, possibly serving as conduits or decorative elements in line with the Steampunk style. The presence of these pipes adds to the industrial feel of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stork have visible mechanical joints at key limb connections (e.g., legs, neck, wings)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stork in Image B has visible mechanical joints at key limb connections such as the legs, neck, and wings. These joints are evident from the articulated segments and the way they connect, resembling hinges and pivots found in machinery. This design choice enhances the mechanical appearance of the stork, making it look like a constructed entity rather than a living bird. The joints contribute to the overall Steampunk aesthetic by emphasizing the mechanical nature of the stork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene rendered in a Steampunk style, with consistent use of mechanical components, metallic textures, and industrial design across both the stork and the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire scene in Image B is rendered in a Steampunk style, with consistent use of mechanical components, metallic textures, and industrial design across both the stork and the house. The stork features metallic plates, mechanical joints, and a gear-like nest, while the house incorporates copper pipes and an overall industrial design. These elements collectively create a cohesive Steampunk atmosphere, blending technology and Victorian-era aesthetics. Comparing this to Image A, which depicts a more natural and traditional setting, the differences highlight the transformation into a Steampunk theme.",
