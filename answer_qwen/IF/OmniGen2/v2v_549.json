        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop-style box is shown in a way that allows us to see the front and top edges, which suggests an isometric perspective. This view provides a three-dimensional appearance of the box, allowing us to observe multiple sides simultaneously. The visual cues such as the angles of the edges and the visibility of both the front and top surfaces support this conclusion.",
