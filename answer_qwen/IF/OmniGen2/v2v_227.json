      "question": "Does the motorcycle and truck appear in a simplified, cartoon-like version with a cute aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motorcycle and truck in Image B are depicted with clean, bold lines and simplified shapes. The colors are bright and uniform, lacking the detailed textures seen in real-life objects. These characteristics align with a cartoon-like style that often aims for a cute or appealing aesthetic. The proportions of the vehicles and rider also appear slightly exaggerated, which is common in cartoons to enhance visual interest.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the key features—the red sport motorcycle, the rider dressed in black gear, and the blue vintage truck—retained in the sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red sport motorcycle, the rider dressed in black gear, and the blue vintage truck are clearly identifiable. Despite the simplification into a cartoon style, these key features are retained and recognizable. This suggests that the core elements from the original image have been preserved in the sticker design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vehicles and rider include playful touches such as exaggerated proportions or expressive characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vehicles and rider in Image B exhibit playful touches such as rounded edges and a lack of realistic details, which can be considered exaggerated proportions in a cartoon context. The rider's posture and the vehicles' designs are stylized rather than realistic, contributing to an expressive and dynamic appearance typical of playful illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a thick white outline around the sticker design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clear thick white outline surrounding the entire sticker design. This outline separates the sticker content from the background, making it distinct and enhancing its sticker-like appearance. The presence of this outline is a common feature in stickers to define their boundaries.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a solid flat color circular base with the motorcycle or truck extending beyond it for a dynamic effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular base in Image B has a solid flat color (blue), and parts of the motorcycle and truck extend beyond this circle, creating a sense of movement and dynamism. This design choice adds visual interest and makes the sticker appear more engaging, as if the vehicles are bursting out of the frame.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background of the sticker transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the sticker in Image B appears to be transparent because the circular design with the vehicles and rider is isolated against a plain white backdrop. There are no additional elements or colors filling the space outside the circular sticker, suggesting transparency.",
