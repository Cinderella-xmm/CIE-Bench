      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible painting on the wall. Instead, a digital display screen is present in that location. The absence of the painting's frame and its artistic content confirms that it has indeed been removed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a rectangular object with a black border and a bright image displayed on it, which is characteristic of a digital display screen. This object occupies the same space where the painting was located in Image A, indicating that it has replaced the painting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital display screen in Image B shows an image of a landscape with a sun, palm trees, and mountains. While this could be interpreted as weather-related imagery, there are no indicators such as temperature readings or weather symbols that would confirm it as real-time weather imagery. Therefore, based on the visual information alone, it cannot be concluded that it displays real-time weather.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing the positions relative to the chairs and the wall in both images, it is clear that the digital display screen in Image B occupies the same space where the painting was located in Image A. The alignment and proportions suggest that the replacement maintains the same position.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The room's composition and balance appear consistent between Image A and Image B. The chairs remain in the same positions, and the central focus (now the digital display screen) retains the same placement on the wall. The size and shape of the new screen also seem to match the original painting, preserving the room's aesthetic balance.",
