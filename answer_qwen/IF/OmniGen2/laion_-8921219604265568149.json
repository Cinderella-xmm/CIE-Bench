      "question": "Is the cathedral and surrounding square depicted at a significantly reduced scale, consistent with a miniature model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cathedral and the surrounding square in Image B appear to be significantly smaller than what would be expected for a real-life scene. The proportions of the building, people, and other elements suggest they are part of a miniature model. This is further supported by the presence of a frame enclosing the scene, which is typical for display models.",
