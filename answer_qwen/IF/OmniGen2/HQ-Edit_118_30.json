      "question": "Are the train cars depicted as large, colorful, interlocking blocks rather than realistic carriages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train cars are depicted as large, colorful blocks that resemble interlocking pieces. This is evident from their simplified shapes and bright colors, which contrast with the realistic appearance of a typical train carriage. The visual cues suggest these are not meant to represent real carriages but rather stylized elements for artistic or playful purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the smoke from the train rendered as swirling white forms instead of a realistic cloud of steam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smoke in Image B appears as swirling white forms, which do not mimic the dense, billowing nature of realistic steam. These forms have a more abstract and decorative quality, indicating an artistic choice rather than a realistic depiction. The visual information suggests a focus on aesthetic appeal over realism.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the countryside landscape been converted into various geometric patterns such as grids, polygons, or angular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The countryside landscape in Image B has been transformed into various geometric patterns. Fields and hills are represented by grids, polygons, and angular shapes, deviating from the naturalistic portrayal seen in typical landscapes. This abstraction simplifies the scene into a more structured and patterned form.",

      "question": "Are all human figures replaced with small puzzle pieces showing individuals in vintage clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, human figures are indeed replaced with small puzzle pieces showing individuals in vintage clothing. These pieces maintain the outlines and postures of people but are clearly part of the puzzle structure, integrating them into the overall design of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the entire puzzle scene placed on a light-colored wooden tabletop with visible grain and edges. The background texture and the framing of the puzzle within this surface provide context that it is a physical object laid out on a table, enhancing the perception of it being a tangible puzzle.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible interlocking edges, seams, or puzzle-piece borders throughout the scene indicating a complex, assembled structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Throughout Image B, there are visible interlocking edges, seams, or puzzle-piece borders that indicate the complex, assembled structure of the scene. These lines separate different elements of the image, reinforcing the idea that the scene is constructed from individual puzzle pieces.",
