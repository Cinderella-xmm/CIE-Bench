      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire body of the truck constructed from visible LEGO bricks in orange, black, and silver colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is clearly constructed from LEGO bricks. The body of the truck shows distinct rectangular and square shapes typical of LEGO construction, with orange bricks forming the main body, black bricks for details like windows and trim, and silver bricks for elements such as the wheels' rims. This analysis is based on the visual cues of the blocky structure and color distribution.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the wheels composed entirely of circular gray LEGO pieces, replacing the original tire and rim design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheels in Image B are composed of circular gray LEGO pieces that form both the tire and rim. There are no visible textures or designs that would suggest a realistic tire and rim; instead, they are simplified LEGO representations. This conclusion is drawn from observing the uniformity and simplicity of the wheel design compared to real-world tires and rims.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth black LEGO tiles, replacing the original textured surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The truck bed in Image B appears to be covered with smooth black LEGO tiles. Unlike the textured surface one might expect in a real pickup truck bed, the LEGO model uses flat black pieces to represent this area. This observation is based on the lack of any detailed texture and the consistent appearance of the black LEGO tiles.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO truck placed on a plain white shelf that elevates it above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO truck placed on a plain white shelf. The shelf elevates the truck above what would be considered the ground level in the image. This is evident from the clear separation between the truck and the dark background, with the white shelf providing a stable base for the LEGO model.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the LEGO model retain the correct shape and proportions of the original pickup truck, including the cab, bed, and wheelbase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO model in Image B retains the general shape and proportions of a pickup truck, including a cab, bed, and appropriate wheelbase length. While it is a simplified representation using LEGO bricks, the overall structure mimics the key features of a real pickup truck. Comparing this to Image A, which shows a real truck, the LEGO model captures the essential elements despite its blocky construction.",
