      "question": "Are bold, graphic lines used to delineate the outline and major features of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is outlined with thick, black lines that sharply define its shape and features. This style is characteristic of graphic illustrations where bold lines are used to create a clear distinction between different elements. The use of such lines helps in emphasizing the cartoonish and stylized nature of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sunglasses depicted in a flat, vibrant orange color without gradients or shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunglasses in Image B are indeed rendered in a solid, bright orange color. There are no visible gradients or shading effects on the lenses, which contributes to the flat and vibrant appearance typical of certain graphic styles. This choice enhances the simplicity and boldness of the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the beach background composed of simplified, abstract color blocks rather than realistic scenery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of large, uniform color blocks representing the sky, sea, and sand. These blocks lack detailed textures or realistic elements, indicating an abstract and simplified approach. This style is often used in graphic art to convey settings in a minimalistic manner.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both the harness and the shadow under the cat replaced with gradient fills?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the harness appears as a solid color block without any gradient fill. Similarly, there is no visible shadow under the cat; instead, the area beneath it blends seamlessly with the background. This absence of gradients and shadows aligns with the flat design aesthetic of the illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are red, blue, and yellow prominently used as flat, high-contrast colors throughout the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features red (in the hot dog), blue (in the cat's fur and ocean), and yellow (in the sky and sand). These colors are applied in a flat manner with high contrast, creating a visually striking and cohesive composition. This use of primary colors is common in graphic designs to achieve vibrancy and clarity.",
