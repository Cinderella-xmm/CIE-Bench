    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the chair constructed entirely from visible LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chair in Image B does not exhibit any visible LEGO-style bricks. The construction appears smooth and continuous, lacking the distinct interlocking features characteristic of LEGO bricks. The materials look like typical office chair components such as leather or plastic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the seat and backrest cushions rendered in sleek black, resembling LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seat and backrest cushions in Image B are indeed rendered in sleek black, but they do not resemble LEGO bricks. They have a smooth, cushioned appearance with stitching lines that suggest padding rather than the blocky structure of LEGO bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the armrests and base of the chair rendered in silver color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armrests and base of the chair in Image B are clearly rendered in a silver color. This is evident from the metallic sheen and reflective properties observed on these parts, which contrast with the black cushions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wheels translucent gray in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheels in Image B are not translucent gray; they appear solid black, consistent with the design of standard office chair wheels. There is no indication of translucency or gray coloration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the seat and backrest composed of visibly layered bricks with smooth gradients between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seat and backrest in Image B do not show visibly layered bricks. Instead, they display a uniform surface with horizontal stitching lines, suggesting a padded design rather than a layered brick structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the armrests designed as simple hinged parts without complex padding or curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armrests in Image B are designed as simple hinged parts without complex padding or curves. They appear as flat, rectangular pieces attached to the frame, consistent with a minimalist design approach.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the chair placed on a plain white tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chair in Image B is placed on a plain white surface that resembles a tabletop. The background is also white, creating a clean and minimalistic setting that highlights the chair.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the image clearly highlight the geometric, modular construction of the chair through visible brick edges and clean lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image does not highlight a geometric, modular construction through visible brick edges and clean lines. Instead, it showcases a smooth, continuous design typical of modern office chairs, lacking the modular elements associated with LEGO-style construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
