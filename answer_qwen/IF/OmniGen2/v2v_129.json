      "question": "Are the stickers arranged in a neat 3x3 grid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By observing Image B, there are 12 stickers arranged in three rows and four columns. This arrangement does not form a 3x3 grid but rather a 3x4 grid. The visual cues clearly show that each row contains four stickers instead of three.",

      "question": "Is the background of the stickers transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stickers have a white background with no visible transparency. Each sticker is set against a plain white backdrop, which suggests that they are not transparent but rather have a solid background color.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all stickers maintain a square, 1:1 aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the stickers appear to be circular or oval in shape, as indicated by their rounded edges and the way they fit within the white outlines. They do not maintain a square, 1:1 aspect ratio; instead, they seem to have a more circular aspect ratio.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each sticker depicts a character engaged in cooking activities, such as stirring or holding a bowl. These actions are consistent across the stickers and do not vary significantly in terms of artistic moods or emotions. The theme is uniform and related to cooking rather than artistic expression.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it is clear that each sticker has a white outline surrounding it. This outline is consistent across all stickers, providing a uniform appearance and separating each sticker from the others and the background.",
