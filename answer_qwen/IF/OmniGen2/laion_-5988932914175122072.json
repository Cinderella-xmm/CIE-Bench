      "question": "Has the black handbag been transformed into a human-like female model with a defined body, posture, and facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black handbag is clearly visible as a bag with no human-like features. There are no signs of a female model's body, posture, or facial features integrated into the handbag. The visual cues such as the straps, hardware, and texture confirm it is a handbag. Therefore, there is no transformation into a human figure.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model in Image B is wearing a black dress that does not replicate the pebbled leather texture or curved silhouette of the handbag.
