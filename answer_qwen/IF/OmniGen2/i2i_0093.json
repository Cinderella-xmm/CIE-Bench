      "question": "Does the image have bright, clean lines and textures characteristic of Pixar animation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image exhibits a high level of detail with smooth, clean lines and textures. The edges of the phone, charger, and cables are sharply defined, and the surfaces appear to have a polished finish. These characteristics align with the aesthetic commonly associated with Pixar's animation style, which often features crisp, well-defined objects with a sense of realism in their digital rendering.",

      "question": "Is the phone still positioned diagonally on the charger, and do the cables maintain their original placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phone is indeed placed diagonally on the charger, similar to its position in Image A. The cables also appear to be in the same relative positions as they were originally. This consistency suggests that the orientation and layout of the objects have been preserved between the two images.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image vibrant and saturated, consistent with Pixar's animation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B are vivid and highly saturated, particularly the green background and the black and metallic tones of the phone and charger. This vibrancy is typical of Pixar's animation style, which often uses bold, saturated colors to create visually striking scenes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting create smooth shadows that enhance the three-dimensional look of the phone and charger?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B casts soft, smooth shadows around the phone and charger, giving them a three-dimensional appearance. This type of lighting is effective in enhancing the depth and realism of the objects, which is a common technique in Pixar's animations to make digital objects appear lifelike.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have any objects or elements been added or removed from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B with Image A, there do not appear to be any additional objects or elements introduced, nor have any been removed. The composition remains consistent, focusing solely on the phone, charger, and cables. Therefore, it can be concluded that no changes in terms of adding or removing elements have been made.",
