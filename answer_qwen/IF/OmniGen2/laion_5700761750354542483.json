      "question": "Is the butterfly now made of soft fabric instead of metallic or gemstone materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly appears to have a soft texture, which is evident from the visible fluffy edges and the way it drapes over the cushion. This suggests that the material has been changed to something softer, like fabric, rather than the hard, reflective surfaces of metallic or gemstone materials typically seen in jewelry. The visual cues such as the lack of shine and the presence of soft shadows support this conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the decorative elements on the butterflyâ€™s wings replaced with embroidered patterns in vibrant blue and gold colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decorative elements on the butterfly's wings in Image B are not embroidered patterns but appear to be embellishments made with shiny, faceted stones set into the fabric. These stones are arranged in a pattern that includes vibrant blue and gold colors, but they do not resemble traditional embroidery. The analysis is based on the reflective quality and three-dimensional appearance of the stones.",

      "question": "Do the wings of the butterfly appear to be made of a velvety material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings of the butterfly in Image B exhibit characteristics typical of velvety material, such as a matte finish and a slightly textured surface. The way light interacts with the material, creating soft highlights and shadows, further supports the conclusion that the wings are made of a velvety material. This assessment is based on common visual properties associated with velvet.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there fluffy or fuzzy textures visible along the edges of the butterfly's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of the butterfly's wings in Image B display a noticeable fluffy or fuzzy texture. This can be observed by the way the material extends slightly beyond the main body of the wings, giving them a soft, plush appearance. This characteristic is consistent with materials like faux fur or similar textiles used for decorative purposes.",

      "question": "Does the butterfly retain its original shape and proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the overall shape and proportions of the butterfly remain largely unchanged. Both images depict a butterfly with similar wing span and body structure. However, the material and texture differences between the two images do not affect the fundamental shape and proportions of the butterfly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is positioned atop a cushion that appears to be pearl-white in color. The cushion provides a smooth, rounded surface that contrasts with the textured butterfly, making it stand out. The color and texture of the cushion align with what is commonly described as pearl-white, supporting this observation.",
