      "question": "Has the original rose petals been completely replaced by a perfume bottle design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a perfume bottle with a cap designed to resemble a rose, but there are no actual rose petals present. The cap is metallic and glossy, indicating it's part of the bottle's design rather than natural petals. Therefore, based on visual cues and common sense about product designs, the rose petals have indeed been replaced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a tall, slender glass bottle present with visible etched petal designs on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottle in the image is not tall or slender; it has a more rectangular and compact shape. There are no visible etched petal designs on its surface. Instead, the bottle features a smooth, reflective surface with a gradient color. Thus, the description does not match the visual evidence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the bottle cap been replaced with a stylized rose-shaped element that has a glossy gold finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap of the bottle clearly resembles a rose with multiple layers of petals. It has a shiny, reflective surface that suggests a glossy gold finish. This matches the description provided, as the cap is both stylized and finished in a way that mimics gold.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The interior of the bottle displays a rich, deep red color that appears to transition subtly from darker at the bottom to lighter towards the top. This gradient effect is consistent with the description given, suggesting a careful observation of the bottle's contents and lighting effects.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the bottle, there is a vertical strip along its side that contains text. The text appears to be minimalistic and gold-colored, fitting the description provided. This detail aligns with the characteristics mentioned in the question.",
