    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the car and coastal road are visibly enclosed within a transparent structure that has sharp edges and reflections typical of glass. The reflections on the edges suggest it is a display case designed to showcase the diorama. This conclusion is drawn from observing the clean lines and glossy surface surrounding the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The car in Image B displays a vibrant red color with noticeable gradient hues across its surface. These gradients give the car a three-dimensional appearance and highlight its contours.

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The road and cliffs in Image B do not exhibit visible stratification or depth that would suggest they are constructed from layered resin.

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
