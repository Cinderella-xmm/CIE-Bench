      "question": "Does the image have a vibrant, clean-lined aesthetic typical of Pixar animations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image exhibits a vibrant and clean-lined aesthetic, which is characteristic of Pixar animations. The colors are bright and saturated, and the lines defining the mouse and other elements are smooth and precise. This style is typical of high-quality 3D animation where attention to detail in design and color enhances visual appeal. The overall look is polished and professional, aligning with Pixar's known style.",

      "question": "Are the textures in the image smooth and simplified in a manner consistent with cartoon-style rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textures in the image are indeed smooth and simplified, consistent with cartoon-style rendering. The fur of the mouse lacks fine detail and instead has a uniform appearance that simplifies the texture for a more stylized look. Similarly, the crumbs and floor have a simplified texture that contributes to the overall cartoonish feel. This approach is common in animated cartoons to maintain a cohesive and visually appealing style.",

      "question": "Does the image feature soft shadowing around the mouse and surrounding objects, contributing to a Pixar-like depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image features soft shadowing around the mouse and surrounding objects, which adds depth and dimensionality. These shadows are not harsh or overly defined but rather subtly integrated into the scene, creating a sense of realism while maintaining the cartoon aesthetic. This technique is often used in Pixar animations to enhance the three-dimensional quality of characters and objects without disrupting the overall visual harmony.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the lighting in the image been adjusted to create a soft, diffused effect typical of Pixar animations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in the image appears to be adjusted to create a soft, diffused effect. There are no harsh shadows or overly bright highlights, which suggests the use of ambient lighting to evenly illuminate the scene. This type of lighting is commonly employed in Pixar animations to achieve a warm and inviting atmosphere, ensuring that all elements are clearly visible and aesthetically pleasing.",

      "question": "Do all elements in the image, including the floor, crumbs, and background, appear to be seamlessly integrated in a Pixar-style animation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All elements in the image, including the floor, crumbs, and background, appear to be seamlessly integrated in a Pixar-style animation. The consistency in art style across these elements ensures that they blend well together, contributing to a cohesive visual narrative. The attention to detail in each component, from the texture of the floor to the placement of crumbs, reflects the meticulousness typical of Pixar productions.",
