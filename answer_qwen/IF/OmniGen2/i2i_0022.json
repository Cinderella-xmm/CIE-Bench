      "question": "Does the cat maintain its curled-up posture in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted in a curled-up posture with its body forming a compact shape. The visual cues such as the positioning of the legs and tail indicate that it is indeed curled up. This analysis is based on the observation of the cat's body language which is consistent with a resting or sleeping position commonly seen in cats.",

      "question": "Is the cat's fur represented by simple gradient color blocks in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's fur is represented by simple gradient color blocks without detailed texture. The lack of intricate fur patterns and the smooth transition of colors suggest a simplified representation typical of illustrations rather than realistic depictions.",

      "question": "Has the car been simplified to a curved surface with only reflection lines present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a car; it only features a cat within a sticker-like frame. Therefore, there is no car to analyze for simplification into a curved surface with reflection lines. Comparing this with Image A, where a car is present, it is clear that the car has been entirely removed in the edited version.",

    {

      "question": "Does the sticker have an irregular shape with a thick white outline and a transparent background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sticker in Image B has an irregular shape that closely follows the outline of the cat, with a thick white border surrounding it. The background appears transparent, as indicated by the clean separation between the sticker and the white background, suggesting that the sticker can be placed over various backgrounds without disrupting the design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire image in Image B is styled in a minimalist illustration manner, featuring a simplified and cute depiction of the cat, which is characteristic of chibi art. The use of basic shapes, soft gradients, and a clean design aligns well with the style typically used for stickers aimed at being visually appealing and easily recognizable.",
