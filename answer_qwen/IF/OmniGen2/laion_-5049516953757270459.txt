    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the heart-shaped board contains LEGO bricks that form a mosaic. The objects on the board are represented by LEGO pieces of various colors and shapes, but they do not entirely consist of LEGO bricks forming a continuous mosaic. Instead, each food item is individually represented by LEGO bricks, maintaining their distinct forms.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks used to represent the food items are indeed colored appropriately to match the original produce. For example, blue LEGO bricks are used for blueberries, red for tomatoes, and green for broccoli. This color matching is evident through visual inspection and aligns with common knowledge of these food items' colors.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "Image B shows different LEGO brick sizes and shapes being used to simulate textures. Smooth bricks are used for the avocado, small round bricks for berries, and larger chunky bricks for broccoli. This choice reflects an understanding of how LEGO can be used creatively to mimic real-world textures based on size and shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:"
    "explanation": "Each food item in the LEGO mosaic has clearly defined and distinct borders separating them from adjacent items. This is observable as the LEGO bricks representing each food item are placed separately, maintaining clear boundaries between them, which is typical in LEGO constructions to ensure clarity and distinction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:"
    "explanation": "The overall shape of the LEGO mosaic in Image B remains a perfect heart, matching the original boardâ€™s silhouette. The heart shape is preserved despite the change in material from actual food to LEGO representation, indicating careful design to maintain the original outline.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:"
    "explanation": "The LEGO mosaic in Image B is placed on a solid, neutral gray base with no visible texture or pattern. This is evident from the uniform background surrounding the heart-shaped board, which provides a clean and simple backdrop that contrasts with the colorful LEGO pieces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7:"
    "explanation": "The LEGO mosaic in Image B exhibits a clear pixelated, blocky appearance consistent with a LEGO construction. Each piece is distinctly blocky and lacks smoothness, reflecting the inherent characteristics of LEGO bricks. This appearance is expected when using LEGO to create representations of objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
