      "question": "Is the image presented as a three-dimensional shadow box diorama with visible depth created by layered components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image appears to be a three-dimensional shadow box diorama. The visible depth is created by layered components, as evidenced by the distinct separation between the Eiffel Tower, the foreground elements like the pool and people, and the background skyline. This layering effect suggests that these elements are not flat but have been arranged in a way to create a sense of depth, typical of shadow box dioramas.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the skyline and foreground elements visibly separated into multiple layered paper cut-out sections to simulate depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyline and foreground elements appear to be separated into multiple layers. The Eiffel Tower stands out prominently against the backdrop of the city skyline, which seems to be placed at a different depth level. The grassy areas and pathways also seem to be cut out and layered separately, contributing to the overall 3D effect. This arrangement simulates depth effectively, resembling paper cut-out sections.",

      "question": "Has the grassy lawn area been replaced with a reflective, mirror-like surface that shows reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grassy lawn area in Image B has been replaced with a reflective, mirror-like surface. This can be observed from the clear reflections of the surrounding structures and figures on the surface, which is inconsistent with the appearance of a natural grassy lawn. The reflective quality adds an artistic element to the scene, enhancing its visual appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there numerous small, detailed, three-dimensional-looking pedestrian figures scattered throughout the scene, particularly on pathways and near the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes numerous small, detailed pedestrian figures scattered throughout the scene. These figures are positioned along pathways and near the base of the Eiffel Tower, adding life and scale to the diorama. Their three-dimensional appearance contributes to the realism of the scene, making it more engaging and dynamic.",

      "question": "Is the entire scene framed by a dark border with visible metallic edges, consistent with a shadow box enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire scene in Image B is framed by a dark border with metallic edges, consistent with a shadow box enclosure. The frame provides a defined boundary for the diorama, enhancing its presentation as a contained, three-dimensional artwork. The metallic edges add a touch of elegance and professionalism to the display.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are city names and geographic coordinates visibly engraved along the outer edge of the frame in fine detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "City names and geographic coordinates are visibly engraved along the outer edge of the frame in fine detail. These engravings provide additional context and information about the depicted scene, enriching the viewer's understanding and appreciation of the diorama. The presence of such details indicates a high level of craftsmanship and attention to detail.",
