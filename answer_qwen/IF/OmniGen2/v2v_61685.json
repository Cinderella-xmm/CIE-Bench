      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit characteristics of a Swiss Design poster, such as clean lines, minimalism, and a focus on typography?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays clean lines and a minimalist aesthetic. The figures are simplified into flat shapes with minimal detail, and the background is reduced to basic geometric forms. The typography 'SKATE FOR ALL' is bold and prominently placed, which aligns with Swiss Design principles of clarity and focus on text. The overall composition is uncluttered and functional.",

      "question": "Is the layout of the edited image strongly asymmetrical?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout in the edited image appears balanced rather than strongly asymmetrical. The figures are centrally aligned, and the tent forms a symmetrical backdrop. The placement of elements suggests an intentional balance, which contrasts with strong asymmetry where one side would dominate over the other.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the human figures and the background tent been simplified into flat graphic shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, both the human figures and the background tent have been reduced to simple, flat graphic shapes. The figures lack detailed features and textures, and the tent is depicted as a plain white triangle. This simplification is characteristic of graphic design aimed at clarity and visual impact.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in the edited image is indeed restricted primarily to blues for the sky and ground, whites for the tent and some details, and green for the man's shirt. These colors are used consistently throughout the image, adhering to a limited and harmonious scheme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'SKATE FOR ALL' is integrated into the upper part of the image against a blue sky background. It uses a bold, clean sans serif typeface that stands out clearly. The choice of font and its placement emphasize readability and visual impact, consistent with effective poster design.",
