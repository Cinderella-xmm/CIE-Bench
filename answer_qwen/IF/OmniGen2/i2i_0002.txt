    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "The image shows a figure on a smartphone screen with clear, defined edges and textures that appear smooth rather than hyperrealistic.

Hyperrealism typically involves highly detailed textures and lifelike imperfections, which are not evident here.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "The image is clearly captured from a frontal perspective where the phone is held in a hand, and the figure on the screen is facing forward. There is no indication of a top-down bird's-eye view as the angles and proportions suggest a direct line of sight.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "The background of the image is a uniform gray color without any additional objects or clutter. This clean background helps to focus attention on the main subject, which is the phone and the figure displayed on its screen.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:"
    "explanation": "The image uses forced perspective by showing a small figure on a phone screen held in a hand. The size difference between the hand, the phone, and the girl creates an illusion of depth and scale, effectively highlighting their proportional differences through this technique.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:"
    "explanation": "The phone screen does not depict a dark floor but instead shows a figure standing against a black backdrop. While the black backdrop might give some impression of a stage, it is not specifically designed to resemble a floor or stage setting.",
