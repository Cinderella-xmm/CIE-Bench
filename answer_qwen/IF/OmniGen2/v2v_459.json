      "question": "Are the ties depicted as 3D chibi-style objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ties in Image B appear to have a stylized, cartoonish look with exaggerated proportions and simplified textures. This style is reminiscent of chibi art, which typically features characters or objects with cute, oversized features and a playful aesthetic. The ties do not have realistic textures or shading but instead have a smooth, almost plastic-like appearance that aligns with chibi-style design.",

      "question": "Are the striped and polka dot patterns still vibrant and clearly visible on the 3D chibi-style ties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the striped and polka dot patterns on the ties remain distinct and colorful. The stripes are bright and evenly spaced, while the polka dots are uniformly sized and distributed. Despite the chibi-style rendering, the patterns retain their vibrancy and clarity, making them easily recognizable.",

      "question": "Are the ties placed inside a realistic drawer setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the ties resting on what appears to be a wooden surface with golden knobs, suggesting a drawer setting. However, the overall presentation has a stylized, non-realistic quality typical of digital illustrations. The wood texture and knobs are simplified and lack the fine details one would expect in a real drawer, indicating it's more of an artistic representation rather than a realistic setting.",

      "question": "Are the ties arranged in a way that suggests they are part of an ornamental display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of the ties in Image B, along with the stylized drawer setting, gives the impression of an ornamental display. The ties are neatly positioned side by side, and the clean, symmetrical layout enhances their visual appeal. This setup is common in decorative displays where items are presented for aesthetic purposes.",

      "question": "Have the original vibrant colors and patterns of the ties been maintained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the ties in both images share similar vibrant colors and patterns. In Image B, despite the chibi-style transformation, the colors remain bright and the patterns are consistent with those in Image A. The editing process has preserved the essential visual characteristics of the ties.",
