      "question": "Does the vehicle display clear graphical elements that evoke the theme of jerk chicken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vehicle has text such as 'JRICKEN' and 'Chicken Curry,' which directly references jerk chicken. The presence of these words clearly indicates a connection to jerk chicken cuisine. Additionally, the graphic design includes stylized fonts and branding elements like 'CHICKER OJOCENLO' and 'CJCK CHICKEN,' which further reinforce the theme. By combining these visual cues with common knowledge about food truck branding, it is evident that the vehicle is designed to evoke the theme of jerk chicken.",

      "question": "Are there graphic elements such as chickens, spices, or flames depicted on the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, there are no visible depictions of chickens, spices, or flames on the vehicle. The graphics primarily consist of text and abstract designs related to the brand identity. While these elements can be associated with jerk chicken through context, they are not explicitly shown in the image. Therefore, based on the visual information alone, the answer is negative.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the vehicle painted in colors such as reds, oranges, or yellows that match the character of jerk chicken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background color of Image B is a solid orange, which is commonly associated with warmth and spiciness, characteristics often linked to jerk chicken. However, the vehicle itself retains its original beige color from Image A, without any significant changes in hue to reflect the theme. Thus, while the background suggests thematic colors, the vehicle does not incorporate them into its paint scheme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire vehicle, including windows and doors, covered in thematic design elements for jerk chicken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vehicle's windows and doors do not appear to be covered in thematic design elements specific to jerk chicken. The main focus of the design seems to be on the text and logos placed around the vehicle rather than an all-over thematic coverage. Comparing this with Image A, where the vehicle was plain, it is clear that some design elements have been added, but they do not fully cover the entire surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all design elements, including colors and graphics, work together cohesively to convey a jerk chicken brand identity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design elements in Image B, such as the text 'JRICKEN' and 'Chicken Curry,' along with the stylized fonts and logos, contribute to a cohesive brand identity related to jerk chicken. Although the vehicle's color remains unchanged and there are no explicit images of chickens or spices, the textual and graphic elements effectively communicate the intended theme. The orange background also complements the theme, even though it is not part of the vehicle itself.",
