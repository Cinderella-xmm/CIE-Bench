      "question": "Is the Blue Jay rendered as a miniature sculpture made of a solid material such as ceramic or metal, rather than a live bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Blue Jay appears to be a miniature sculpture rather than a live bird. This conclusion is drawn from its perfectly symmetrical and polished appearance, which lacks the natural imperfections of a living creature. The uniformity in color and texture suggests it is made of a solid material like ceramic or metal. Additionally, its placement within a glass dome further supports this as live birds are not typically displayed in such enclosures.",

      "question": "Is the Blue Jay sculpture enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Blue Jay sculpture in Image B is indeed enclosed within a transparent glass dome. This is evident from the clear, rounded structure surrounding the bird, which reflects light and has a knob on top, typical of display domes used for showcasing objects. The transparency allows a full view of the sculpture while protecting it, indicating an intentional design choice for presentation.",

      "question": "Is there a wooden perch beneath the sculpture with ivy vines visibly winding upward along it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no wooden perch beneath the sculpture with ivy vines visibly winding upward along it in Image B. Instead, the bird is perched on what appears to be a small tree stump. The absence of a wooden perch and ivy vines can be confirmed by observing the base area around the sculpture, which consists of moss-like material and stylized leaves.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows small, stylized, crafted leaves placed around the base near the sculpture. These leaves are uniformly shaped and arranged in a decorative manner, contributing to the overall aesthetic of the scene. Their presence enhances the garden-themed environment depicted in the image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A miniature, stylized tree stump is present in the scene near the sculpture in Image B. It serves as the perch for the Blue Jay sculpture and is integrated into the terrarium setup. Its size and design are consistent with being a miniature element within the larger composition.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the terrarium in Image B is covered in a textured, earthy, moss-like material that contrasts with the blue and white colors of the sculpture. This material provides a naturalistic backdrop that complements the other elements in the scene, enhancing the overall garden-themed aesthetic.",
