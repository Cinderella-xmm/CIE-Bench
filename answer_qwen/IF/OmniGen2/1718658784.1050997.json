      "question": "Does the cake feature bold, graphic icing patterns such as geometric shapes, stripes, or repetitive motifs instead of realistic frosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is decorated with bold, graphic patterns consisting of horizontal stripes in red and white. This type of decoration is not realistic frosting but rather a stylized design that uses repetitive motifs. The analysis is based on observing the clear, distinct lines and uniformity of the stripes, which are typical of graphic designs rather than natural frosting textures.",

      "question": "Are the balloons composed of vivid monochrome dots rather than solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The balloons in Image B feature vivid monochrome dots against their backgrounds. Specifically, some balloons have orange dots on a white background, while others are solid colors like blue. This observation is made by noting the consistent pattern of dots on certain balloons, which contrasts with the solid colors of other balloons. The presence of these dots indicates a specific design choice rather than random placement.",

      "question": "Is the table rendered as a flat, solid color block without texture or gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The table in Image B is rendered as a flat, solid color block without any texture or gradient. It appears as a uniform red surface beneath the objects placed on it. This conclusion is drawn from the lack of shading, highlights, or any variation in color across the table's surface, which aligns with the characteristics of a flat color block.",

      "question": "Is the vase depicted as a solid color block without visible texture or design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vase in Image B is depicted as a solid yellow color block without visible texture or design. There are no patterns, gradients, or detailed features on the vase, indicating a simple, flat rendering. This assessment is based on the uniformity of the color and the absence of any intricate details that would suggest texture or design.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the candle flame have exaggerated sharp lines and bright, saturated colors instead of a natural, soft glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The candle flame in Image B has exaggerated sharp lines and bright, saturated colors instead of a natural, soft glow. The flame is depicted with a pointed shape and a bright yellow hue, which is characteristic of a stylized representation rather than a realistic depiction of fire. This conclusion is reached by comparing the flame's appearance to common visual representations of flames in art versus real-life observations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the entire image exhibit characteristics of pop art, including flat colors, bold outlines, and stylized forms across all elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire image in Image B exhibits characteristics of pop art, including flat colors, bold outlines, and stylized forms across all elements. This is evident from the uniform color blocks, sharp lines, and simplified shapes used throughout the scene. These features are typical of pop art style, which often emphasizes boldness and simplicity over realism. Comparing this to Image A, where there is more detail and realistic textures, further supports this conclusion.",
