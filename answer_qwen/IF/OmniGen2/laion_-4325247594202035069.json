      "question": "Are the four figures transformed into fish-shaped forms with visible fins and tails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are clearly depicted as having fish-like characteristics such as fins and tails. The limbs of the original warrior figures have been replaced with these aquatic features, which is evident from the visual cues like the streamlined bodies and the presence of fins. This transformation aligns with common artistic interpretations where characters are reimagined in different forms.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the figures appear to be made of soft fabric instead of rigid plastic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in Image B exhibit a texture that suggests they are made of a soft material, likely fabric. This is indicated by the way light interacts with their surfaces, creating a less reflective and more matte appearance compared to what would be expected from rigid plastic. Additionally, the edges and folds suggest flexibility typical of plush toys.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the figures covered in vibrant patterns using blue, green, red, and yellow colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figures adorned with bright and vivid colors. The use of blue, green, red, and yellow is prominent, forming stripes and other patterns on the figures. These colors are commonly used in children's toys and plushies to make them visually appealing and engaging.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fins and tails of the fish figures exaggerated in size and shape compared to the original warrior limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the figures in Image B to the warriors in Image A, the fins and tails of the fish figures are indeed larger and more pronounced than the limbs of the original warriors. This exaggeration is a common technique in design to emphasize the new form and create a playful, cartoonish effect.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the plush figures arranged on a sandy-textured fabric surface that resembles an underwater scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B has a sandy texture, which can be interpreted as resembling an underwater scene. This choice of background complements the fish-themed figures, enhancing the thematic consistency of the image. The texture provides a sense of environment that supports the aquatic theme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the transformation into fish shapes, the figures in Image B maintain dynamic poses similar to those of the warriors in Image A. The positioning of their bodies and limbs suggests movement and action, indicating that the designer aimed to preserve the energetic stance of the original figures even after the transformation.",
