      "question": "Has the fabric of the Victorian attire been dissolved into cosmic dust?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monkey is still wearing a detailed and intact Victorian-style suit with visible textures and buttons. There are no visual cues suggesting that the fabric has disintegrated or transformed into cosmic dust. The suit appears solid and well-defined against the background.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the brass scientific instrument exhibit intricate, clockwork tendrils growing from it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass scientific instrument indeed has elaborate, swirling tendrils extending from it. These tendrils have a mechanical appearance, resembling clockwork components, which suggests an imaginative fusion of machinery and organic forms. This observation is based on the visible details and artistic style of the tendrils.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the clockwork tendrils softly grasping the monkey's subtly distorted hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tendrils in Image B appear to be interacting with the monkey's hand, wrapping around it in a manner that could be interpreted as 'softly grasping.' The hand itself does not seem overtly distorted but rather naturally positioned as if holding the tendrils. This conclusion is drawn from the positioning and interaction between the tendrils and the hand.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image evoke a profound, dreamlike state characteristic of Surrealism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B combines elements like a dressed monkey, a fantastical instrument with clockwork tendrils, and a cosmic background, creating an otherworldly and imaginative scene. Such a combination of disparate and dreamlike elements is typical of Surrealist art, aiming to evoke a sense of the subconscious and the surreal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the overall composition and positioning of the monkey and the instrument been maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the core composition remains consistentâ€”the monkey is seated similarly, and the instrument is placed in front of it. However, Image B introduces new elements like the clockwork tendrils, which add complexity but do not significantly alter the fundamental positioning of the main subjects.",
