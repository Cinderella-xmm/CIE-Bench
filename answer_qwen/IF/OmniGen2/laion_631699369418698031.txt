    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the totem pole is depicted within a small, enclosed space that includes miniature plants and a glass dome. The size of the totem pole relative to the surrounding elements suggests it has been scaled down to fit this environment. This setup resembles a diorama or terrarium, which are commonly used to create miniature 3D scenes. The confined space and the presence of other small-scale elements support the conclusion that this is indeed a miniature scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
