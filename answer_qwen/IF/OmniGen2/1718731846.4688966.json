      "question": "Does the figurine appear to be made of polished wood, with visible wood grain and a smooth, reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B does not exhibit characteristics typical of polished wood. There is no visible wood grain or texture that would suggest it's made of wood. Instead, the surface appears smooth and uniform, resembling a painted or coated material rather than natural wood. The reflective quality also seems more consistent with plastic or ceramic materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black and white areas of the dog's fur represented using contrasting natural wood tones (dark vs. light)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black and white areas on the dog's fur in Image B are clearly defined but do not resemble natural wood tones. The contrast is achieved through paint or similar coloring methods rather than variations in wood coloration. Natural wood tones typically have more subtle gradations and textures, which are absent here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the figurineâ€™s contours appear smooth and rounded, avoiding sharp or angular edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The contours of the figurine in Image B are indeed smooth and rounded. There are no sharp or angular edges visible; the design emphasizes softness and a friendly appearance, which is common in decorative figurines intended for aesthetic appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are facial features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth enhanced with visible fine carved lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features of the dog in Image B are well-defined but do not appear to be enhanced with fine carved lines. Instead, they seem to be painted or molded into the material, giving a smooth and cohesive look without the texture that carving would introduce.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figurine placed on a minimalist wooden platform that matches the carving style and material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B is placed on a circular platform that appears to be made of wood, matching the minimalist aesthetic of the scene. The platform complements the figurine by providing a simple, unobtrusive base that doesn't detract from the main subject.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image emphasize craftsmanship through natural wood textures, subtle lighting, and a muted color palette compared to the original bright appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not emphasize craftsmanship through natural wood textures since the figurine itself lacks wood-like qualities. However, the image does use subtle lighting and a muted color palette, creating a softer and more subdued atmosphere compared to the brighter and more vivid appearance of Image A.",
