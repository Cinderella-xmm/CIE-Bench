    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B clearly show a transparent glass dome enclosing the entire scene. The dome's curvature and reflection are evident, and it acts as a barrier between the interior elements and the background. This is consistent with common knowledge of glass domes used to display or protect objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the parrot depicted in a chibi style with a large head and simplified body proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parrot in Image B does not exhibit chibi-style characteristics. It maintains realistic proportions and detailed features typical of a macaw. Chibi style usually involves exaggeratedly large heads and simplified bodies, which are not present here.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the leaves surrounding the parrot significantly larger than normal scale and vibrant in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaves surrounding the parrot in Image B appear significantly larger than normal scale and are vibrant in color. This can be inferred from their size relative to the parrot and their bright, saturated hues, which are often used in artistic renderings to emphasize natural beauty.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small, shiny, crystal-like beads visible on the surface of the leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are small, shiny, crystal-like beads visible on the surface of the leaves. These beads reflect light and add a decorative element to the scene, enhancing its visual appeal.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a tiny human figure on a different branch, holding a sketchbook or drawing tool and facing the parrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no tiny human figure on a different branch holding a sketchbook or drawing tool in Image B. The scene only includes the parrot, smaller bird, leaves, and the glass dome. No human figures are present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the base of the glass dome feature a wooden texture with carved or etched tribal patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the glass dome in Image B features a wooden texture with carved or etched tribal patterns. This can be observed through the visible grain and design details on the base, which align with common artistic representations of woodwork.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the diorama include visual elements such as dense foliage, mist, or warm ambient lighting that suggest a rainforest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B contains dense foliage and vibrant colors that suggest a natural environment, there are no explicit visual elements such as mist or warm ambient lighting that specifically indicate a rainforest setting. The focus is more on the enclosed diorama rather than an immersive rainforest atmosphere.",
