    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "The coat in Image B appears to have a velvety texture suggested by the way light interacts with its surface, creating soft highlights and shadows that imply a plush material. Additionally, the color tone is a darker crimson, which can be inferred from the rich, deep hue that contrasts with the lighter background. Comparing this with Image A, where the coat seems less saturated and possibly smoother, reinforces the conclusion about the texture and color change.",
