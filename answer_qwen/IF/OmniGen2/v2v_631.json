      "question": "Does the image feature warm tones and soft lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image predominantly uses cool colors like purple for the hair and black for the clothing. The background is a neutral beige, which does not contribute to warm tones. The lighting appears even and lacks any soft glow or warmth that would typically be associated with warm tones and soft lighting effects.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image includes several rectangular blocks on the left side that resemble code snippets with text and syntax highlighting, which are common representations of programming code. These elements suggest the inclusion of programmer-related tools or icons.",

      "question": "Are stats like [Coding +10] and [Creativity +8] represented as skill bars in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows skill bars labeled 'Coding +10' and 'Creativity +8'. These bars have plus signs and numerical values, indicating an increase in these skills. The design and labeling clearly represent these as stats related to the character's abilities.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the image, there is a banner with the word 'Characure', and at the bottom, there is a nameplate with the word 'Cretature'. Both are framed with clean, polished borders that match the overall aesthetic of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background is a neutral beige color, which contrasts rather than complements the purple and black color scheme of the character. Complementary colors would typically enhance each other, but here the background remains neutral and does not add to the vibrancy of the character's colors.",
