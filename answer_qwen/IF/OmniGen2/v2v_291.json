      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B clearly depict a hippopotamus and a rabbit positioned next to each other. Both characters are upright, facing forward, and appear to be interacting or posing together. This arrangement is typical for character cards or illustrations where two subjects are meant to be seen as companions or partners. The analysis does not require comparison with Image A.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits characteristics of a 3D cartoon rendering. The smooth textures, soft shading, and rounded shapes of the hippo and rabbit suggest a 3D modeling approach.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are textual elements at the bottom that resemble stats or skills, such as 'Spilll -xc' and 'Patce +10'. These are likely placeholders for game-related attributes. The presence of these elements suggests that the image is part of a game card or similar design. There's no need to refer to Image A for this observation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a clear title banner at the top reading 'CHAREE CARD', which serves as a header for the card. At the bottom, there is a nameplate-like section containing text such as 'TAAPL NO', which acts as a footer or label for additional information. This layout is common in collectible cards or game interfaces. No reference to Image A is necessary.",
