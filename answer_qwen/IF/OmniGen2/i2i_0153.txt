    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B indicate a cartoon rendering style. The truck and background elements have smooth, clean lines with solid colors and lack the fine details and textures typically found in realistic images. This is consistent with common characteristics of cartoon illustrations, which often use simplified shapes and bold outlines to convey objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck maintains its original structure as seen through the recognizable features such as the cab design, wheel placement, and overall shape. These elements are consistent with typical semi-truck designs, suggesting that the core structure has been preserved even though the style has changed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "Comparing the truck in Image B with what would be expected from a realistic image (as inferred from Image A), the lines in Image B appear bolder and more defined. This is characteristic of cartoon styles, where outlines are emphasized for clarity and visual impact. In contrast, realistic images tend to have softer, less pronounced edges.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:"
    "explanation": "The colors in Image B are noticeably more vivid and saturated compared to what would be expected in a realistic image. The red of the truck and the green of the trees are bright and uniform, lacking the subtle variations and gradients that are typical in real-world photography. This heightened color saturation is a hallmark of cartoon-style renderings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:"
    "explanation": "The background in Image B appears simplified, featuring fewer details and a more stylized representation of trees and sky. This contrasts with what would be expected in a realistic image, where backgrounds usually contain more intricate details and natural variations. Simplifying the background is a common technique in cartoons to focus attention on the main subject.",
    "answer": "Yes"
