      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a rectangular box with an illustration of a Viking ship on its front cover.

      "question": "Are Norse motifs such as runic patterns, interlacing designs, or dragon heads visibly integrated into the artwork of the ship on the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the artwork of the Viking ship on the box, there are visible elements that resemble Norse motifs. The ship's prow features a dragon head, which is a common element in Viking ship designs. Additionally, the sail includes a circular knotwork pattern, which is characteristic of Norse art. These details are consistent with traditional Norse decorative styles.",

      "question": "Is the title \"Voyage of the Vikings\" displayed in bold, readable typography on the box cover?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title on the box reads 'VILAKANES THES', which does not match 'Voyage of the Vikings'. While the typography is bold and readable, the content of the text does not correspond to the given phrase. Therefore, based on the visual information provided, the specific title mentioned in the question is not displayed.",

      "question": "Is the circular knotwork pattern from the sail used as part of a game board layout, such as a grid or path system, within the box artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular knotwork pattern from the sail is present on the box cover but is not integrated into a grid or path system within the box artwork. It appears as a standalone decorative element on the sail rather than part of a functional game board layout. There is no indication of a game board layout using this pattern.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are small, stylized figures depicted along the side of the Viking ship on the box cover. These figures appear to be rowers, consistent with the historical depiction of Viking ships. They are placed along the ship's side, reinforcing the theme and adding detail to the artwork.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The side panels of the game box do not feature a visible wooden texture or grain pattern. Instead, they display additional artwork and text related to the game's theme. The material of the box appears to be cardboard, which is standard for board game packaging, and does not mimic a wooden texture.",
