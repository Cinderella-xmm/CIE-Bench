    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the hot dog replaced with a model made of red, yellow, and tan LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog is clearly constructed from LEGO bricks. The colors used are red for the sausage and yellow for the bun, with tan bricks forming the base of the bun. This observation is based on the distinct blocky appearance and color scheme typical of LEGO constructions.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the original bottle been replaced with a mosaic-style ceramic object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottle in Image B appears to be made of colorful LEGO bricks arranged in a mosaic style rather than being a ceramic object. The structure mimics the shape of a bottle but uses LEGO's characteristic building blocks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mosaic ceramic piece feature geometric patterns in red, yellow, and tan colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mosaic-style LEGO bottle in Image B does not feature geometric patterns in red, yellow, and tan colors. Instead, it uses a variety of colors including blue, green, and white, which do not match the specified color scheme.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both the LEGO hot dog and the mosaic ceramic piece placed on a smooth wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the LEGO hot dog and the LEGO bottle in Image B are placed on a smooth wooden base. This can be inferred from the uniform texture and color of the surface they rest on, which resembles wood.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Does the LEGO hot dog maintain an elongated, cylindrical shape similar to a real hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO hot dog in Image B maintains an elongated, cylindrical shape similar to a real hot dog. Despite being made of LEGO bricks, the overall form follows the typical proportions and length of a hot dog.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the mosaic ceramic piece have a rounded, artistic form rather than a realistic bottle shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO bottle in Image B does not have a rounded, artistic form; instead, it retains a more realistic bottle shape using LEGO bricks. The structure is designed to mimic the shape of a traditional bottle.",
