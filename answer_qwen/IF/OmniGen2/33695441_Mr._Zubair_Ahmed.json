    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the spiral staircase as a serpent creature rather than a standard architectural structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a spiral staircase with wooden railings and stone steps. There are no visual cues that suggest the staircase has been transformed into a serpent creature. The structure maintains its architectural form, with no indication of features like scales, a spine, or other biological elements typical of a serpent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the steps of the staircase appear as segmented scales, forming a pattern consistent with reptilian skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steps in the edited image appear as standard stone steps of a staircase. They do not exhibit any segmented patterns resembling reptilian scales. The texture and appearance remain consistent with typical stonework used in architecture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the railing been transformed into a spine-like structure with vertebrae or bone-like segments that follow the spiral path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The railing in the edited image retains its original design as a continuous wooden structure with balusters. There is no transformation into a spine-like structure with vertebrae or bone-like segments. The railing's form follows the spiral path of the staircase but does not mimic biological structures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible wooden patterns or textures resembling a skeletal framework integrated into the serpent's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden patterns on the railing in the edited image are consistent with natural wood grain textures. There are no additional patterns or textures integrated to resemble a skeletal framework. The wood appears as it would in an ordinary staircase design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there stone-like ridges or raised, rocky textures running along the body of the serpent creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the staircase in the edited image does not display any stone-like ridges or rocky textures. The steps and railings maintain smooth surfaces typical of architectural materials such as stone and wood.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the spirals of the staircase rendered as graceful, continuous coils resembling those of a serpent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spirals of the staircase in the edited image are indeed rendered as graceful, continuous coils. However, these coils are characteristic of spiral staircases rather than serpentine forms. The continuity and flow are architectural in nature, not biological.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the serpent creature exhibit visual traits suggesting antiquity and natural grandeur (such as weathered textures, earthy colors, or organic forms)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the staircase in the edited image may exhibit some traits suggesting antiquity through its material and design, there are no specific visual cues indicating natural grandeur or organic forms associated with a serpent creature. The overall appearance remains architectural.",
