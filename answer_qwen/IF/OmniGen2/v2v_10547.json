      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct figure resembling a squirrel positioned prominently in the foreground. The visual cues include its recognizable features such as a bushy tail, upright posture, and typical coloration of brown fur with white underparts. These characteristics are consistent with common knowledge about squirrels. Therefore, based on these observations, it can be concluded that there is indeed a squirrel present.",

      "question": "Does the squirrel blend naturally with the painting's brushstrokes and color palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The squirrel in Image B appears to have been painted using similar brushstrokes and colors that match the rest of the painting. Its fur texture and shading follow the swirling patterns and vibrant hues characteristic of the artwork. This suggests an effort to integrate the squirrel seamlessly into the scene. Comparing this with Image A, where no such figure exists, reinforces that the squirrel has been added with attention to blending with the existing style.",

      "question": "Is the squirrel positioned in the foreground, closer to the viewer than other elements in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The squirrel is clearly placed in the foreground of Image B, as it is larger and more detailed compared to the distant village and sky. Its position relative to the tree and other elements indicates it is intended to be perceived as closer to the viewer. This placement follows the principles of perspective commonly used in paintings to create depth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the addition of the squirrel maintain the overall harmony and composition of the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The squirrel's integration into Image B seems to respect the original composition while adding a new focal point. It does not disrupt the balance between the swirling sky, the village, and the prominent tree. However, the addition of any new element could potentially alter the viewer's focus, which might slightly affect the harmony depending on personal interpretation. Comparing with Image A, the original composition is largely preserved.",

      "question": "Is the squirrel sized appropriately in relation to other elements in the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The size of the squirrel in Image B appears proportionate when considering its placement in the foreground. It is neither disproportionately large nor small compared to the tree and the distant village, maintaining a sense of scale that aligns with realistic expectations. This sizing helps it fit naturally within the scene without appearing out of place.",
