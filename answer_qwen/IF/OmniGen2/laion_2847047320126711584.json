      "question": "Is the edited image structured as a two-panel comic strip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image is clearly structured into four distinct panels, each depicting a scene with a donut character in various poses and actions. The layout of the image follows a comic strip format, but it consists of four panels rather than two. This conclusion is drawn from observing the grid-like arrangement of the panels and the sequential storytelling typical of comic strips.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image feature bold outlines, vibrant colors, and exaggerated expressions typical of pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image features bold black outlines around the characters and objects, vibrant primary colors such as yellow for the background and blue for the donut's attire, and exaggerated facial expressions on the donut character. These elements are characteristic of pop-art style, which often emphasizes bright colors, clear lines, and expressive features to create a visually striking effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all donuts depicted with doughy limbs, expressive icing eyes, and sugar-crusted armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the image, the donuts are anthropomorphized with limbs that resemble doughy arms and legs, eyes made from icing that convey expression, and armor that appears to be sugar-crusted. This creative depiction transforms the inanimate food items into animated characters, aligning with the whimsical nature of the comic strip.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a speech bubble in Panel 1 containing the text “Guardians of the Plate, unite!” spoken by a donut character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 1 does not contain a speech bubble with the text “Guardians of the Plate, unite!”. Instead, this phrase appears in Panel 3, where the donut character is depicted with an open mouth as if speaking. The speech bubble is correctly placed in the third panel, not the first.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does Panel 2 show donuts surrounding a large coffee mug fortress, holding marshmallow spears and chocolate shields?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 shows the donut character standing alone, holding marshmallow spears and chocolate shields, without any surrounding donuts or a coffee mug fortress. The setting is minimalistic, focusing solely on the character's pose and equipment. Therefore, the description of donuts surrounding a large coffee mug fortress is inaccurate for this panel.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the text elements (e.g., speech bubbles) rendered in playful, cartoon-style fonts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text elements, including the title and speech bubbles, are rendered in fonts that are playful and cartoonish, with rounded shapes and bold lettering. These stylistic choices enhance the lighthearted and humorous tone of the comic strip, making the text easily readable and engaging.",
