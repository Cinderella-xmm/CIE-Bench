      "question": "Does the edited image include the front, left side, and top views of both refrigerators?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows four different angles of the refrigerator. However, none of these angles provide a top view of the refrigerator. The images show the front and left side views but not the top. Therefore, based on the visual cues in Image B alone, it is clear that the top view is missing.",

However, these elements do not distract from the main focus on the refrigerators.
