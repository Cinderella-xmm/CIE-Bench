    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the stack of tires reshaped into a creature resembling an armadillo with a segmented, armored back made from the tire treads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B has a segmented, armored appearance with a back that resembles the treads of tires. The overall shape and structure mimic an armadillo's form, with the segments aligned in a way that suggests a protective shell. This conclusion is drawn from observing the visual cues such as the patterned segments and their arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible metallic joints located within the openings between the tires, suggesting mechanical articulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible metallic components within the spaces between what appear to be wheels or limbs. These joints look like they could allow for movement, which is consistent with mechanical articulation. The presence of these joints is inferred from their placement and design, resembling hinges or connectors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the central wheel hubs been replaced with glowing mechanical eyes that emit light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows central hubs on the wheels that have been modified to resemble glowing eyes. The light emitted from these hubs gives the impression of eyes, which is not typical for standard tires. This observation is based on the bright, focused light and the positioning where eyes would logically be placed on a creature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there antennae-like structures extending from the top of the creature, featuring electric blue accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the creature in Image B features protrusions that resemble antennae, with electric blue accents that stand out against the darker body. These structures are unlike anything seen on regular tires and suggest a purpose beyond mere function, possibly for sensory input or communication.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature feature steampunk-style elements such as gears, rivets, or brass-colored metalwork, giving it a mechanical guardian appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B does include metallic elements and rivets, the overall style does not strongly align with steampunk aesthetics, which typically involve brass, copper, and intricate gearwork. The design leans more towards a futuristic or robotic theme rather than steampunk.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the original tire tread patterns still visible and used as part of the creature’s armored exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tread patterns from the original tires are still visible in Image B, integrated into the creature’s design as part of its armored exterior. This is evident from the texture and pattern continuity between the tires and the creature's shell.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the creature have a posture or design indicating it is capable of movement, such as being balanced on wheels or having rolling components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B is designed with wheels at its base, suggesting it is capable of rolling or moving. The balance and posture indicate a functional stance that supports mobility, which is inferred from the wheel placement and overall structural integrity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
