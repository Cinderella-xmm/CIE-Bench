      "question": "Does the background show a battlefield scene with visible explosive effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B clearly depicts a large explosion with bright flames and smoke, which are typical visual cues of a battlefield. The presence of soldiers in military attire further supports this interpretation. Combining these visual elements with common knowledge about battlefields leads to the conclusion that the background is indeed a battlefield scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the character's pose and facial expression identical to those in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character stands upright with a neutral or slightly concerned expression, which contrasts sharply with the screaming figure in Image A. The pose and expression in Image B do not match the iconic distorted scream from Image A. Therefore, based on the visual differences observed, the answer is clear.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the character remain the primary focus and maintain its prominence within the composition despite the new background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the dramatic and visually intense background in Image B, the character remains centrally positioned and is distinct from the surrounding elements. The character's placement and contrast against the background ensure it stays as the focal point. This analysis considers the principles of visual hierarchy and composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the new battlefield background integrated seamlessly without abrupt transitions or disruptions around the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition between the character and the battlefield background appears smooth, with no noticeable edges or inconsistencies that would disrupt the integration. The lighting and color tones of the character blend well with the background, suggesting a seamless integration. This assessment relies on evaluating visual continuity and coherence.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are elements commonly found in a battlefield scene, such as soldiers, smoke, or debris, present in the new background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes soldiers in military uniforms, an explosion with flames and smoke, and a chaotic environment typical of a battlefield. These elements align with common depictions of battle scenes, confirming their presence in the background. This conclusion is drawn from recognizing standard features associated with battlefields.",
