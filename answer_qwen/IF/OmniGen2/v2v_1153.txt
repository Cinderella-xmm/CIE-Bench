    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings exhibit a metallic sheen and smooth surfaces that are not typical of traditional architecture. The pagoda and other structures have been rendered with a futuristic design, characterized by clean lines and reflective materials. This is evident from the way light interacts with the surfaces, creating highlights and reflections that suggest a metallic texture. Combining this visual information with common sense about traditional versus modern architectural styles leads to the conclusion that the buildings now have a sleek, metallic appearance.",
