    "Question": "Q1: Does the image include a front view of the office environment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction that shows the office environment from a direct frontal perspective. The illustrations are segmented into different angles—side and back views—but none provide a clear front-facing angle of the office setup. This conclusion is drawn by analyzing the orientation of the characters and objects in each segment.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a side view of the office environment present in the image?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes segments where the office environment is shown from a side perspective. For instance, one segment shows two individuals seated at desks with their profiles visible, indicating a side view. This analysis is based on observing the relative positions of the people and objects in relation to the viewer's perspective.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the image incorporate a top view of the office environment?",
    "explanation": "There is no segment in Image B that provides a bird's-eye or overhead view of the office environment. All segments show either side or back perspectives of the individuals and their surroundings. Therefore, it can be concluded that a top view is not included.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the three views (front, side, and top) depicted as distinct illustrations within one image?",
    "explanation": "Based on the analysis of Image B, only side and back views are present. There is no front or top view depicted. Thus, while multiple views are shown, they do not encompass all three specified views (front, side, and top).",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the combined illustrations show the full office environment layout comprehensively, covering essential elements like desks, chairs, and equipment?",
    "explanation": "The combined illustrations in Image B cover various aspects of the office environment, including desks, chairs, computers, and plants. However, due to the absence of a front and top view, some spatial relationships and comprehensive layout details might be missing. Nonetheless, the essential elements are represented across the different views.",
    "answer": "Yes"
