    "Question": "Q1: Is the teapot now a cylindrical container instead of its original rounded shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object is clearly a cylindrical container with a flat top and bottom. This is evident from the straight sides and circular top view. The original teapot in Image A had a rounded body with a spout and handle, which are not present here. Therefore, the analysis confirms that the shape has changed from rounded to cylindrical.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are floral patterns embossed in golden foil on the surface of the teapot container?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a cylindrical container with decorative elements. There are indeed floral patterns visible on the surface, but they appear as printed designs rather than embossed textures.
