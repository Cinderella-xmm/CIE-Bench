      "question": "Has the bird been converted into a stylized illustrated emblem rather than remaining a photorealistic depiction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird appears as a stylized illustration rather than a photorealistic depiction. This is evident from its simplified and clean lines, uniform coloration, and lack of detailed textures that would be present in a realistic image. The bird's features are more graphic and less nuanced, which aligns with common practices in illustrated emblems for packaging design.",
