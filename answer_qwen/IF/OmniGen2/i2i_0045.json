      "question": "Does the edited image contain only the girl, the stone platform, and the frisbee without any other distractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not contain a girl, a stone platform, or a frisbee. Instead, it shows an expansive grassy field under a clear blue sky. There are no visual cues that suggest the presence of these objects. The analysis is based on the visible elements in the image and common sense about what constitutes a girl, a stone platform, and a frisbee.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the background been replaced with a wide expanse of grass and a blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image clearly displays a wide expanse of grass covering most of the frame with a bright blue sky above. This matches the description of a background replacement with grass and sky. The analysis is straightforward as the visual content directly corresponds to the described elements.",

      "question": "Does the composition of the edited image adhere to the golden ratio principles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the composition adheres to the golden ratio principles, one would typically look for a balanced division of space where key elements align with the golden spiral or grid. In this image, there are no distinct focal points or elements that can be aligned with such a principle. The image is mostly uniform without any specific composition that suggests adherence to the golden ratio.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image consists solely of a grassy field and a blue sky. There are no additional objects or elements present beyond these two components. The analysis is based on the absence of any other discernible features or objects within the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The quality of the image is high, with vibrant colors and clear details, making it suitable for various uses including photography training data. However, since the instructions mentioned specific elements (girl, stone platform, frisbee) that are not present in the image, it does not adhere strictly to the given instructions. Therefore, while the image quality is good, its suitability for the specified purpose is compromised.",
