      "question": "Is the basketball player depicted in a stylized cartoon form with exaggerated muscles and dynamic pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The basketball player in Image B is depicted with a cartoonish style, featuring exaggerated muscle definition and a dynamic pose that suggests movement. The lines are bold and the proportions are not realistic, which aligns with common characteristics of stylized cartoons. This conclusion is drawn from observing the visual cues such as the thick outlines, simplified shapes, and the overall aesthetic that is typical of cartoon illustrations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the basketball player's outfit and/or body adjusted to include bold neon tones matching the graffiti background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basketball player's outfit includes bright colors like yellow and blue, which stand out against the colorful graffiti background. However, these colors do not appear to be neon tones; they are more consistent with standard sports uniform colors. The body itself does not have any neon adjustments. Therefore, while the colors are bold, they do not specifically match the neon description.",

      "question": "Is there a blank graffiti-style text area present on the side of the image suitable for adding custom messages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a rectangular area on the right side with horizontal lines resembling a text box. This area has a graffiti-style border and the word 'SRREEK' written in a graffiti font above it, suggesting it is meant for custom messages. The presence of this element is clear and fits the description of a blank graffiti-style text area.",

      "question": "Does the edited image feature visual elements such as spray-paint textures, graffiti fonts, or vibrant contrast that enhance the street art vibe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates various elements that contribute to a street art vibe. These include the use of vibrant colors, graffiti fonts (e.g., 'SRREEK'), and a background filled with spray-paint textures. The contrast between the bright colors and dark outlines enhances the visual impact, which is characteristic of street art. These observations confirm the presence of visual elements that enhance the street art vibe.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the basketball player clearly identifiable in a basketball setting with a hoop and court, even after the stylistic transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B presents the basketball player in a stylized cartoon form, the setting still clearly indicates a basketball context. The player is wearing a basketball uniform and is posed in a manner typical of basketball action. However, there is no visible hoop or court in the image, which might make it less immediately identifiable as a basketball setting compared to a more traditional depiction. Despite this, the overall context and attire suggest a basketball theme.",
