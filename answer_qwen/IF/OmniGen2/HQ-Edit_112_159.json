      "question": "Is the car and coastal road enclosed within a transparent glass display case with visible edges and reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car and coastal road are visibly enclosed within a transparent structure that has sharp edges and reflections typical of glass. The reflections on the edges suggest it is a display case designed to showcase the diorama. This conclusion is drawn from observing the clean lines and glossy surface surrounding the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car exhibit metallic red coloring with visible gradient hues across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The car in Image B displays a vibrant red color with noticeable gradient hues across its surface. These gradients give the car a three-dimensional appearance and highlight its contours. This analysis is based on the visual observation of the car's reflective and shiny surface, which suggests the use of metallic paint or material.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible dynamic curves and sharp detail lines present on the car’s bodywork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The car in Image B features dynamic curves and sharp detail lines on its bodywork. These design elements are characteristic of high-performance sports cars, where aerodynamics play a crucial role. The visible lines and curves enhance the car's sleek and modern aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the road and cliffs appear to be constructed from layered resin, showing visible stratification and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The road and cliffs in Image B do not exhibit visible stratification or depth that would suggest they are constructed from layered resin. Instead, they appear as smooth surfaces integrated into the diorama. This conclusion is based on the uniform texture and lack of distinct layers observed in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Are micro gravel textures visibly embedded in the road and cliff surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no micro gravel textures visibly embedded in the road and cliff surfaces in Image B. The surfaces appear smooth and polished, consistent with the overall aesthetic of a carefully crafted diorama. This assessment is made by closely examining the texture details of the surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a sunset sky panel placed at the top of the display case, forming part of the diorama’s upper boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no sunset sky panel placed at the top of the display case in Image B. The upper boundary of the display case is clear and does not feature any additional panels or images. This conclusion is reached by analyzing the top edge of the display case for any such elements.",
