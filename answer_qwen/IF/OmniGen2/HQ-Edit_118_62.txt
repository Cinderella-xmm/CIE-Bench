    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The pigeon in Image B appears to have soft, rounded features and a fabric-like texture, which are characteristic of plush toys. The edges are not sharp, and the overall appearance suggests it is made of a soft material rather than being a realistic depiction of a bird. This conclusion is drawn from observing the smoothness and lack of detailed feathering that would be present in a real or highly realistic representation of a pigeon.",
