      "question": "Is the cow depicted in a stylized 3D chibi art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cow in Image B exhibits exaggerated and simplified features, such as a larger head relative to its body and rounded shapes, which are characteristic of chibi art styles. The 3D rendering further supports this conclusion as it gives the cow a cartoonish appearance. Combining these visual cues with knowledge of chibi art styles leads to the conclusion that the cow is indeed depicted in a stylized 3D chibi art style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow maintains distinct black-and-white coat patterns that resemble those typically found on Holstein cows. These patterns are consistent with real-world observations of such cattle, indicating that the cow retains its original black-and-white coat patterns despite the stylized art style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the cow leaning against the vintage television with both front hooves placed atop the screen. This positioning is evident from the angle and placement of the cow's legs and hooves in relation to the television. The interaction between the cow and the television is intentional and visually clear.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cow in Image B does not exhibit a mischievous grin. Its facial expression appears neutral or slightly curious, without any visible signs of a grin or playful demeanor. Based on the visual cues and common understanding of animal expressions, the cow does not sport a mischievous grin.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a scene set in a grassy field with a bright sky and a few clouds. The grass and sky appear to be rendered in a 3D modeling style, which aligns with the overall artistic approach used for the cow and television. The presence of these elements confirms that the scene is set as described.",
