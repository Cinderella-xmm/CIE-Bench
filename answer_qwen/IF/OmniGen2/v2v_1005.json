      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the heads relative to the bodies appear exaggerated compared to typical human proportions. The heads seem larger in relation to the rest of the body, which is a common characteristic in cartoon or stylized illustrations. This observation is based on comparing the head size with the torso and limbs, which appear smaller in proportion.",

      "question": "Are the facial features and accessories of the three individuals precisely detailed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features and accessories are simplified and lack fine detail. The faces have smooth textures with minimal shading, and the accessories like hats and glasses are depicted in a basic manner without intricate details. This style is typical for cartoonish or animated images where precision is sacrificed for a more stylized look.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bodies of the three individuals have a cartoonish appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bodies of the individuals in Image B exhibit characteristics typical of cartoon illustrations. They have simplified shapes, uniform colors, and lack realistic textures or complex shading. These elements contribute to an overall cartoonish appearance that is distinct from photorealistic depictions.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the log cabin in the background smaller in scale compared to the individuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the log cabin appears to be smaller in scale relative to the individuals. This can be inferred by comparing the size of the cabin's windows and doors to the height of the individuals. The cabin seems to be designed to fit within the same frame as the individuals, suggesting a smaller scale than what would typically be expected in a real-world setting.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the three individuals positioned in front of the small-scale log cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three individuals are clearly positioned in front of the log cabin. The cabin is visible behind them, and its smaller scale relative to the individuals suggests it is further back in the scene. This positioning is consistent with the visual cues provided by the image.",
