      "question": "Has the person been transformed into a flat illustration-style tennis-themed chibi sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The person in Image B is depicted in a flat, simplified style with exaggerated features typical of chibi art. The character has large eyes, a small body, and minimalistic details, which are characteristic of chibi illustrations. The tennis theme is evident from the tennis racket and ball included as part of the sticker set.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the person depicted in the same original pose as in image A?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is shown making a victory V-sign with one hand while holding a tennis ball in the other. Comparing this to Image A, where the person is holding a tennis racket and not making a V-sign, it's clear that the pose has been altered for the sticker design.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi sticker retain a red dress and a white hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi sticker in Image B shows the person wearing a red dress and a white hat, which aligns with the attire seen in Image A. This retention of key elements helps maintain the identity of the character despite the stylistic transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tennis racket simplified into a black-lined filled shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tennis racket in Image B is indeed simplified into a basic shape with black lines outlining it. It lacks detailed strings and shading, fitting the flat illustration style of the sticker.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all three matching sticker elements—a tennis ball, a victory V-sign hand, and red clay court lines—generated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes three stickers: the chibi character, a tennis ball, and a grid representing the red clay court lines. However, there is no separate sticker showing a victory V-sign hand, even though the character is making that gesture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do all stickers have white borders and transparent backgrounds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each sticker in Image B has a white border around it, which is common for stickers to define their edges. The background appears transparent as there are no visible background colors or patterns behind the stickers.",
      "weight": 1,
