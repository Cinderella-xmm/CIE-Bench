    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "The water below the cliff in Image B appears to be translucent and flows in a manner that connects seamlessly with the form of the titan. It gives the impression of spectral limbs extending from the titan's body, which is not a natural occurrence but rather a fantastical element added for dramatic effect. This observation is based on the unusual interaction between the water and the rock formation.",

    "Question": "Q4:"
    "explanation": "The small trees in Image B are arranged in a pattern that follows the contour of what appears to be the titan’s head or neck, creating the illusion of a textured mane. This arrangement is not random but carefully placed to enhance the mythical appearance of the titan. In contrast, natural tree placement would not typically follow such a specific and decorative pattern.",

    "Question": "Q6:"
    "explanation": "The clouds in Image B have not been replaced by glowing, twisting spirit-like forms spiraling around the titan’s body.

Therefore, there is no evidence of such spirit-like forms in the image.",
