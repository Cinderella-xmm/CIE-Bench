        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The edited image clearly shows multiple distinct sections, each resembling a postcard-style panel.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the red dress and black leather jacket are indeed outlined with bold, thick lines, which is characteristic of comic or graphic art styles.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",

      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The edited image incorporates comic-style visual elements such as panel borders that define each scene. However, there are no speech bubbles or motion lines present.
