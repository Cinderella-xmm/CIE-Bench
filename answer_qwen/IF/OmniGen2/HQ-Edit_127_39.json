      "question": "Does the edited image depict the Eiffel Tower as a sentient, humanoid-like cybernetic sorceress with a distinct form suggesting consciousness and magic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a humanoid figure with a cybernetic design, featuring glowing elements and intricate patterns that suggest advanced technology or magic. The form is upright and has features like eyes and a crown that imply consciousness and a sentient nature. The overall appearance aligns with the description of a cybernetic sorceress.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the original spire of the Eiffel Tower been replaced with a glowing energy crown at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the structure is adorned with a glowing energy crown, which is distinctly different from the spire seen in Image A. This change suggests a transformation from the original Eiffel Tower's spire to a more fantastical element.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are intricate digital glyphs visibly engraved or illuminated on the structural girders of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a humanoid figure with numerous illuminated lines and symbols across its body, resembling digital glyphs. These details are not present in Image A, where the Eiffel Tower's girders are simply iron lattice without such embellishments.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no visible holographic elements such as floating light projections or shimmering visual effects surrounding the structure in Image B. The figure is static with embedded lights but lacks dynamic holographic animations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any pixelated energy barrier around the base of the tower. The base appears solid with a circular platform and blue lighting, but there is no indication of an energy barrier.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the structure retain the iron lattice design, now styled as a flowing cloak-like covering over the sorceress form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The structure in Image B retains a semblance of the iron lattice design, but it is reimagined as part of a flowing cloak-like covering over the humanoid form. This creative interpretation merges the original architectural style with the new cybernetic aesthetic.",
