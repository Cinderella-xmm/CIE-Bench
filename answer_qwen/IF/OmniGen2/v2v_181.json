      "question": "Is the sheep and clock scene enclosed within a transparent snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep and clock are clearly visible inside a spherical, transparent structure that resembles a snow globe. The edges of this structure are smooth and rounded, typical of a snow globe's design. Additionally, there is a base supporting the sphere, which is characteristic of snow globes. This analysis is based on visual cues such as the shape, transparency, and context of the objects within the sphere.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe rest on a wooden tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the snow globe in Image B appears to be placed on a surface with a wood-like texture and color, suggesting it is a wooden tabletop. The warm tones and grain patterns visible under the snow globe support this conclusion. This assessment is made by observing the surface characteristics and comparing them with common features of wooden tables.",

      "question": "Is the scene illuminated by gentle, ambient lighting, casting warm glows on the table and nearby areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a soft, diffused light source that creates a warm ambiance around the snow globe and the surrounding area. The light appears to be coming from above and slightly behind the snow globe, casting subtle shadows and highlights that give the scene a cozy and inviting feel. This observation is based on the lighting effects and their impact on the overall mood of the image.",

      "question": "Are the sheep and clock depicted as adorable chibi-style 3D models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sheep and clock in Image B have a stylized appearance with exaggerated proportions and simplified features, which are hallmarks of chibi-style art. The sheep has a rounder body and face, while the clock maintains a cute and simplistic design. These observations align with the characteristics of chibi-style 3D models, which often emphasize cuteness and simplicity.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sheep casually leaning against the clock inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep is positioned close to the clock but does not appear to be leaning against it. The sheep stands upright with its body facing forward, maintaining a slight distance from the clock. There is no indication of physical contact or a leaning posture between the two objects. This conclusion is drawn from analyzing the spatial relationship and postures of the sheep and clock.",

      "question": "Are there gently drifting snowflakes surrounding the sheep inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the snow globe in Image B, there are small white particles scattered throughout the air, resembling gently drifting snowflakes. These particles add to the wintry atmosphere typically associated with snow globes. The presence of these particles is consistent with the expected contents of a snow globe, enhancing the scene's charm and thematic consistency.",
