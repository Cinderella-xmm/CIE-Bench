    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B clearly show a transparent glass dome enclosing the entire scene. The dome's curvature and reflection are evident, and it acts as a barrier between the interior elements and the background. This is consistent with common knowledge of glass domes used to display or protect objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The parrot in Image B does not exhibit chibi-style characteristics. It maintains realistic proportions and detailed features typical of a macaw. Chibi style usually involves exaggeratedly large heads and simplified bodies, which are not present here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The leaves surrounding the parrot in Image B appear significantly larger than normal scale and are vibrant in color.

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:",
    "explanation": "The base of the glass dome in Image B features a wooden texture with carved or etched tribal patterns. This can be observed through the visible grain and design details on the base, which align with common artistic representations of woodwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7:",
    "explanation": "While Image B contains dense foliage and vibrant colors that suggest a natural environment, there are no explicit visual elements such as mist or warm ambient lighting that specifically indicate a rainforest setting.
