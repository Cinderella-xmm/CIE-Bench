      "question": "Is the mango depicted with visible pixelation characteristic of 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mango in Image B is depicted with a blocky, pixelated appearance that is characteristic of 8-bit graphics. The edges are not smooth but rather composed of large, visible pixels, which is typical for low-resolution images from early video games and digital art. This style uses pixelation to represent shapes and details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the table and napkin rendered with a simplified, low-resolution appearance consistent with 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table and napkin are rendered with a very simplified and low-resolution appearance. The lines and shapes are composed of large pixels, lacking fine detail, which aligns with the aesthetic of 8-bit graphics where complex textures are reduced to basic forms due to resolution constraints.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image utilize a limited color palette typical of 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a limited color palette, using only a few distinct colors for the mango, table, and napkin. This is consistent with 8-bit graphics, which were constrained by technology to use fewer colors, resulting in a simplified visual presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are shadows and highlights on the mango and table simplified to match the flat shading typical of 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows and highlights on the mango and table in Image B are indeed simplified, with flat shading that lacks the gradient transitions seen in higher-resolution images. This flatness is typical of 8-bit graphics, where shading is often represented by solid blocks of color rather than smooth gradients.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the image simplified, focusing on basic shapes and forms rather than detailed textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition of Image B focuses on basic shapes and forms rather than detailed textures. The mango, table, and napkin are represented with simple geometric shapes and minimal detail, which is characteristic of 8-bit graphics aiming for clarity and recognizability within technical limitations.",
