    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "The bookshelf and books in Image B appear to be constructed from LEGO bricks. This is evident from the uniform, blocky structure of the shelves and the books, which are typical characteristics of LEGO constructions. The edges and surfaces have a consistent, plastic-like texture that is not characteristic of wood. Additionally, the way the pieces interlock and stack is indicative of LEGO building techniques.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "In Image B, each book appears as an individual LEGO block with earthy tones such as brown, tan, and terracotta. These colors are commonly used in LEGO sets to represent wooden or natural materials. The uniformity in size and shape of the 'books' further supports this observation, as they align with the standard dimensions of LEGO blocks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "Image B shows darker LEGO bricks used to replicate intricate carvings on the shelf and book spines. These darker bricks create contrast against the lighter background, mimicking the appearance of detailed engravings. This technique is a common method in LEGO builds to add detail and depth to structures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:"
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the LEGO tower indeed narrows progressively toward the top, forming a tapered shape. This design choice is visible through the decreasing width of the shelves as they ascend, which is a deliberate architectural feature often seen in LEGO constructions for both aesthetic and structural purposes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:"
    "explanation": "The surface of the LEGO structure in Image B is smooth and plastic-like, lacking any wood grain or natural texture. This is consistent with the material properties of LEGO bricks, which are made of plastic and do not exhibit the organic variations found in wood. The uniformity and sheen of the surface confirm this analysis.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:"
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is plain and muted, without any patterns or textures. This type of background is often used in photography and presentations to minimize distractions and highlight the main subjectâ€”in this case, the LEGO structure. The simplicity ensures that all attention remains on the LEGO construction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
