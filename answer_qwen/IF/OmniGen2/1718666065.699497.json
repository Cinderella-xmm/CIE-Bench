      "question": "Is the unicorn's body rendered with a smooth, glazed, creamy white ceramic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn's body appears to have a smooth and glossy surface with a creamy white color. This is indicative of a ceramic material that has been glazed, as ceramics often exhibit such characteristics when finished with a glaze. The uniformity and sheen suggest a polished, glazed finish rather than a rough or matte texture.",

      "question": "Are the mane and tail replaced with delicate, curl-shaped porcelain elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mane and tail in Image B are depicted with a series of curls that resemble porcelain elements. Porcelain is known for its delicate and refined appearance, which matches the visual cues of the curls being smooth, well-defined, and having a slight sheen, suggesting they are made from a similar material.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the unicornâ€™s horn a polished metallic spiral?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horn of the unicorn in Image B is clearly rendered as a spiral shape with a polished metallic appearance. The reflective quality and the way light interacts with the surface suggest it is metallic, and the spiral design is typical of how horns are often stylized in artistic representations.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a minimalist gallery setting with neutral tones and no forest elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background that is simple and uncluttered, consisting of neutral tones that resemble a gallery setting. There are no forest elements present, which aligns with the description of a minimalist gallery environment. This contrasts with Image A, where the background includes dark, forest-like elements.",

      "question": "Does the unicorn stand on a gently textured stone base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The unicorn in Image B stands on what appears to be a stone base with a gentle texture. The base has a natural look with subtle variations in tone and surface detail, consistent with stone material. This is different from Image A, where the unicorn is standing on an uneven, rocky terrain without a distinct base.",
