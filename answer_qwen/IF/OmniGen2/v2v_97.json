        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag is depicted as a lovable, moe-style anime character with cat-like attributes such as ears, whiskers, and a tail. This conclusion is drawn from observing the visual cues where the bag has been anthropomorphized with these features, which are commonly associated with cute and endearing characters in anime culture. The addition of these attributes transforms an inanimate object into a living character.",
