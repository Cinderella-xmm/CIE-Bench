      "question": "Is the eagle enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B clearly show an eagle surrounded by a smooth, transparent structure that resembles a glass dome. The dome's transparency allows the eagle and its surroundings to be seen clearly while enclosing them. This is further supported by the reflection and refraction of light on the surface of the dome, which are characteristic of glass materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the eagle appear as a 3D stylized sculpture with sculptural features (e.g., defined form, modeling lines, or material texture)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eagle has a defined form with visible modeling lines and a textured appearance that suggests it is a 3D sculpture. The details in the feathers and the overall shape indicate a crafted object rather than a living bird. The lighting and shadows enhance the three-dimensional effect, typical of sculptures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there miniature swirling clouds located directly under the eagle's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows small cloud-like structures positioned beneath the eagle's wings. These structures have a swirling design, resembling miniature clouds. Their placement directly under the wings supports the conclusion that they are intended to represent clouds supporting the eagle.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature clouds under the eagleâ€™s wings decorated with visible gold leaf accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the miniature clouds under the eagle's wings do not exhibit any visible gold leaf accents. The clouds appear to be uniformly colored without additional decorative elements like gold leaf.",

      "question": "Is the base of the display made of polished dark wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the display in Image B appears to be made of a material with a polished, dark finish that resembles wood. The smooth texture and reflective quality suggest a polished surface, common in wooden bases for displays.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Noble Sky Guardian' is clearly engraved on the base of the display. The engraving is legible and follows the curvature of the base, indicating it is an intentional part of the design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no visible brass compass roses around the base or exterior of the glass dome in Image B. The area surrounding the base and the dome does not contain any objects resembling compass roses.",
