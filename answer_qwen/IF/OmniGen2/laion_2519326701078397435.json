      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the overall style of the bust been transformed into a steampunk-inspired design, incorporating mechanical or industrial elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show a bust with metallic textures and industrial components such as gears and pipes. The steampunk aesthetic is characterized by a fusion of Victorian-era design with imagined steam-powered technology. The presence of these elements, along with the polished bronze finish, aligns with the steampunk style. Therefore, it can be concluded that the bust has indeed been transformed into a steampunk-inspired design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the curls in the hair been replaced with gear-like or cogwheel-shaped structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair area features circular shapes resembling gears or cogwheels, which are not typical of natural hair curls. This suggests that the original curls have been artistically replaced with mechanical elements to fit the steampunk theme. The analysis is based on the distinct appearance of these mechanical parts compared to organic hair structures.",

      "question": "Has the drapery been replaced with metallic fabric that includes visible rivets and tubular elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bust wearing what appears to be metallic armor with visible rivets and tubular elements instead of traditional cloth drapery. These features are consistent with steampunk designs that often incorporate industrial materials and aesthetics. The transformation from soft fabric to hard, metallic components is evident through the visual inspection of the image.",

      "question": "Are vintage watch parts and gears visibly incorporated into the base of the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the base of the sculpture in Image B, there are visible elements resembling vintage watch parts and gears. These components contribute to the steampunk theme by adding intricate mechanical details. The integration of such elements into the base reinforces the overall steampunk-inspired design of the bust.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a mechanical monocle device visible over the right eye area of the bust?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible mechanical monocle device over the right eye area of the bust in Image B. The eye area does not display any additional mechanical components that would suggest the presence of a monocle. The absence of such a feature is clear from the visual inspection of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the color scheme of the bust been changed to predominantly feature polished bronze and copper tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bust in Image B exhibits a polished bronze and copper color scheme throughout its surface. This change in coloration is evident when comparing it to the white marble appearance typically associated with classical sculptures. The use of these metallic tones enhances the steampunk aesthetic and is a significant departure from the original color scheme.",
