    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the robot feature streamlined, symmetrical forms with chrome or highly reflective metallic surfaces typical of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B features smooth, sleek lines and highly reflective metallic surfaces that are characteristic of Art Deco design. The symmetry and streamlined forms suggest a deliberate aesthetic choice to evoke the elegance and modernity associated with this style. The chrome-like finish further enhances the reflective quality typical of Art Deco.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the flamingos depicted as stylized geometric patterns rather than realistic birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flamingos exhibit stylized geometric patterns on their bodies, which deviate from realistic depictions. These patterns consist of bold, contrasting stripes that transform the birds into more abstract, artistic representations rather than lifelike ones.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the palm trees in the background have angular, geometric forms instead of natural, curved shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm trees in Image B have angular, geometric forms instead of natural, curved shapes. This is evident from the rigid, straight lines forming the trunks and the simplified, almost blocky appearance of the fronds, which contrasts with the organic shapes typically seen in real palm trees.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the rocks in the background rendered with stylized, geometric shapes rather than natural rock formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rocks in the background of Image B are rendered with stylized, geometric shapes. They lack the irregularities and textures of natural rock formations, appearing instead as simplified, angular forms that contribute to the overall stylized aesthetic of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene rendered in a muted pastel color palette, avoiding strong or vibrant hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not use a muted pastel color palette. Instead, it features vibrant and strong hues, particularly in the flamingos and the background gradient, which range from bright pinks to greens, indicating a departure from muted tones.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the robot positioned centrally among the flamingos, maintaining the original compositional layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B is positioned centrally among the flamingos, maintaining a similar compositional layout as one might expect from the original image. This central placement ensures the robot remains the focal point, surrounded by the stylized birds.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
