    "Question": "Q1: Is the woman depicted in a stylized cartoon form with simplified features and exaggerated proportions?",
    "explanation": "The woman in Image B is clearly illustrated in a cartoon style, evident from her large eyes, smooth skin texture, and simplified facial features. Her proportions are also exaggerated compared to realistic human anatomy, such as the larger head-to-body ratio and the more pronounced curves of her dress. This analysis is based on visual cues that align with common characteristics of stylized cartoons.",
