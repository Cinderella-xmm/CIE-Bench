    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The figure in Image B appears to be a marble statue due to the smooth, monochromatic texture of the skin and saree. The lack of color variation and the uniformity suggest that it is not a living person but rather a sculpted representation. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues of material texture and the artistic style typical of marble statues.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The figure in Image B is depicted in a standing pose with one arm slightly bent and the other hanging down, which is characteristic of classical sculpture aiming for balance and elegance. The posture suggests stability and poise, common in traditional statuary. This analysis is based on observing the stance and comparing it with known characteristics of classical sculptures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The folds of the saree in Image B are detailed with clear lines and shading that give the impression of movement and flow. These details mimic how fabric would naturally drape and fold, suggesting an effort to create a realistic and dynamic appearance within the constraints of a marble sculpture. The intricacy is evident through the careful rendering of each fold.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the figure standing on a pedestal that has a classical design, featuring clean lines and a tiered structure typical of pedestals used for displaying statues in formal settings. The presence of this element supports the interpretation of the scene as a classical-style display.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The saree in Image B is rendered with a marble texture throughout, including its patterns and borders. The uniformity in texture across the entire garment indicates that it is part of the marble sculpture rather than a separate, colored textile. This observation is based on the consistent material appearance seen in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:",
    "explanation": "The necklace and earrings in Image B appear as engraved or incised details on the marble surface. They lack the depth and shine that would be present if they were actual jewelry. Instead, they are integrated into the marble texture, consistent with how such accessories might be represented in a marble sculpture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7:",
    "explanation": "Image B places the statue within what appears to be an ornate palace hall, characterized by classical architecture elements such as columns and arches.
