      "question": "Is the entire image rendered in a hand-painted watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire image in Image B appears to have a consistent hand-painted watercolor style. The edges of objects and figures are soft, with colors blending smoothly into each other, which is characteristic of watercolor painting. There are no sharp lines or high-contrast areas that would suggest a different medium or style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the foreground woman depicted in greater detail compared to the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground woman is depicted with more defined features and vibrant colors compared to the background elements. Her facial details, clothing texture, and the glass she holds are more pronounced, indicating greater detail in her depiction. This suggests a focus on her as the main subject.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the background figures represented with light-colored linework and faint washes rather than detailed rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background figures in Image B are less detailed and appear to be represented with lighter strokes and faint washes of color. They lack the depth and detail seen in the foreground woman, which aligns with common artistic techniques used to emphasize the main subject by keeping the background less prominent.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the woman appear to be elegantly raising her glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B is holding a glass raised slightly above the table level, with her arm extended in a manner that suggests an elegant gesture. This posture is commonly associated with toasting or presenting something, which can be interpreted as elegantly raising her glass.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition structured so that the foreground woman is the central point of attention?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of Image B clearly centers around the foreground woman. She is positioned prominently in the lower center of the frame, with her actions and attire drawing attention. The background elements are secondary and do not compete for focus, reinforcing her as the central point of attention.",
