      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus does not display any spines; instead, it has a smooth surface with embedded elements that resemble crystals.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cactus with various symbols or glyphs on its surface. These glyphs appear to be glowing with a soft light, suggesting they are luminous.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the cactus in Image B is no longer a simple terracotta pot. Instead, it appears to be a more elaborate structure resembling a sandstone pedestal.
