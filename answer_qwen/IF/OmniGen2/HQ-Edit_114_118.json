    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible curved glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B clearly show a curved glass dome enclosing the entire scene. The dome's boundaries are visible, and it appears to refract light, which is consistent with the properties of glass. This suggests that the scene is indeed enclosed within a glass dome.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sails depicted with visible creases, layered edges, and shadows consistent with a papercraft material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sails exhibit characteristics such as creases, layered edges, and shadows that align with how papercraft materials would appear. These details suggest a crafted appearance rather than realistic fabric sails. The analysis is based on the visual texture and shading of the sails.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a translucent, shimmering blue resin layer beneath the ship that mimics ocean waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a translucent, shimmering blue layer beneath the ship that resembles ocean waves. This layer has a resin-like quality, with smooth textures and light reflections that mimic water. The conclusion is drawn from the visual properties of the material and its placement under the ship.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the seagulls suspended by fine, barely visible wires, giving them a static yet dynamic floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seagulls in Image B appear to be suspended in mid-air, but there are no visible wires supporting them. If wires were present, they would likely be thin and barely noticeable, but their absence here suggests the birds are part of the diorama design without physical support.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the ship retain its original structural details such as masts, rigging, and hull design, now presented in miniature scale within the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ship in Image B retains detailed structural elements like masts, rigging, and hull design, all scaled down proportionally to fit within the diorama. These features are consistent with a miniature model, maintaining the original design in a smaller form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the blue resin layer exhibit shimmering surface textures and light reflections that simulate flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue resin layer in Image B displays surface textures and light reflections that simulate flowing water. The shimmering effect and the way light interacts with the surface create an illusion of movement, enhancing the realism of the ocean representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the curved glass dome visibly present with clear boundaries and possible light refraction effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The curved glass dome in Image B is visibly present, with clear boundaries that enclose the scene. Light refraction effects can be observed, particularly around the edges of the dome, indicating its presence and material properties.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
