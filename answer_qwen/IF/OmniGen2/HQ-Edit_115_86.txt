    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina is depicted with a stylized and simplified form typical of cartoon illustrations. The tutu appears more voluminous and less detailed compared to realistic depictions, which often show more texture and natural folds. This suggests an exaggerated style aimed at enhancing visual appeal in a cartoon context. Comparing this with Image A, where the tutu has a more realistic volume and detail, confirms that Image B indeed features a larger and more voluminous tutu.",
