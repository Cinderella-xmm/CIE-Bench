      "question": "Is the hiking boot replaced with a finely carved wooden sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B is clearly a hiking boot, not a wooden sculpture. The visual cues such as the laces, eyelets, and tread pattern on the sole are characteristic of a boot. There is no evidence of wood grain or carving that would suggest it is made of wood.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the object in Image B is not a wooden sculpture but a hiking boot, there are no detailed panels or lacing preserved in a wooden sculpture. The boot retains its original features, which are consistent with typical hiking boots.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a hiking boot with leather texture and rubber sole, not wood tones replicating leather. The materials appear to be genuine leather and rubber, not wood.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hiking boot in Image B is positioned on what appears to be a minimalist wooden shelf. This can be inferred from the clean lines and simple design of the surface beneath the boot.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no visible grain patterns on the surface of the object in Image B because it is a hiking boot made of leather and rubber, not wood. Wood grain patterns would only be present on wooden objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B maintains the robust form of a hiking boot, with sturdy construction and design elements typical of such footwear. It does not have the characteristics of a wooden sculpture.",
