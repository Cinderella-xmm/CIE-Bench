      "question": "Have the skis and hockey sticks been redesigned into wearable footwear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects still resemble skis and hockey sticks in shape and structure. There are no visible features such as straps, soles, or other components that would suggest they have been transformed into wearable footwear. The analysis is based on the visual cues of the objects' shapes and structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vivid patterns from the original skis and hockey sticks incorporated into the new footwear design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the objects in Image B remain skis and hockey sticks and have not been redesigned into footwear, there is no new footwear design to incorporate the patterns into. Therefore, this question is not applicable based on the current image content.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wooden textures from the hockey sticks incorporated into the new footwear design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Similar to the previous question, since there is no redesign into footwear, the wooden textures of the hockey sticks cannot be incorporated into a non-existent footwear design. This conclusion is drawn from the observation that the objects retain their original form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no evidence in Image B of any new footwear being created. The objects maintain their original forms as skis and hockey sticks, thus there is no imaginative form reflecting the original designs in a new footwear context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As there is no indication of new footwear being designed in Image B, it is not possible for unconventional materials to be used in its design. The analysis is based on the absence of any footwear in the image.",
