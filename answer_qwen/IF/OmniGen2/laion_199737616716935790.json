      "question": "Is the motorcycle composed entirely of black and blue LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motorcycle in Image B appears to be constructed from LEGO-style bricks, which are predominantly blue and black. The visual cues such as the blocky structure and uniform color distribution suggest that it is indeed composed entirely of these two colors of LEGO bricks. There are no other colors or materials visible.",

      "question": "Does the LEGO model retain the angular design features of the original motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO model in Image B retains angular design features similar to a real motorcycle. The sharp edges and geometric shapes mimic the sleek lines of the original motorcycle. This conclusion is drawn by observing the structured and angular build of the LEGO model, which aligns with common design elements of motorcycles.",

      "question": "Are the wheel rims replaced with intricate cog patterns typical of LEGO mechanical parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheel rims of the LEGO model in Image B do not appear to have intricate cog patterns typical of LEGO mechanical parts. Instead, they seem to be simple circular designs without detailed mechanical components. This analysis is based on the smooth appearance of the rims, lacking any visible cogs or gears.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no colorful printed tiles representing decals on the LEGO model in Image B. The model uses solid blue and black LEGO bricks without any additional printed details. Comparing this with Image A, where decals are present, it's clear that the LEGO model does not replicate these decals.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO model in Image B is placed on a smooth gray baseplate. However, there are no directional arrows visible on the baseplate. The baseplate serves as a flat platform for the model but lacks any additional markings or designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue and black stripes in Image B follow a dynamic flow and positioning similar to those in Image A. The stripes maintain a consistent pattern along the body of the LEGO model, mirroring the design seen in the original image. This comparison is made by observing the alignment and continuity of the stripes in both images.",
