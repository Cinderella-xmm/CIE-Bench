    "Question": "Q1: Has a person been added to the image near the zebra's tail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible human figure positioned close to the zebra. The person appears to be interacting with the zebra, standing near its head rather than its tail. This suggests that a person has indeed been added to the scene. The analysis does not rely on Image A but uses the visual cues from Image B combined with common sense about the placement of figures in relation to animals.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the zebra have its head partially turned toward the person?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's head is oriented towards the watering hole, and it appears to be drinking. There is no indication that the zebra has turned its head toward the person. The zebra's posture and focus suggest it is engaged in drinking rather than interacting with the person. This conclusion is drawn solely from the visual information in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the person's foot positioned near or on the zebra's tail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the person's feet are clearly visible and positioned near the watering hole, away from the zebra's tail. The zebra's tail is located at the opposite end of its body from where the person is standing. Therefore, based on the visual evidence in Image B, the person's foot is not near or on the zebra's tail.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the original elements of the watering hole and surrounding environment maintained?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the watering hole and the surrounding environment appear consistent with natural settings typically seen in wildlife habitats. The rocks, dry ground, and sparse vegetation are similar to those in Image A, indicating that the original elements have been maintained. Comparing both images shows that the environmental context remains largely unchanged despite the addition of the person.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the zebra's expression and posture indicate it is startled?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's posture and expression do not suggest it is startled. The zebra is focused on drinking water, and its body language appears calm and undisturbed by the presence of the person. This observation is based on the visual cues in Image B, which show the zebra in a relaxed state typical of an animal engaged in a routine activity like drinking.",
    "answer": "No"
