      "question": "Has the log cabin been replaced with a geometric crystal structure made of transparent, faceted surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is clearly not a log cabin but a highly stylized and abstract geometric form. The visual cues include sharp angles, smooth surfaces, and a lack of any wooden textures or natural elements typically associated with a log cabin. Instead, the structure exhibits characteristics of a crystal-like formation with transparent and reflective properties. This conclusion is drawn from observing the distinct differences in material appearance and structural design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the exterior surfaces of the structure consist of transparent, faceted planes that reflect or refract blue and green hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The structure in Image B displays a series of flat, angular surfaces that are visibly transparent and have a glossy finish. These surfaces exhibit a gradient of blue and green colors, suggesting light refraction and reflection typical of glass or crystal materials. The presence of these hues indicates that the surfaces are designed to interact with light in a way that produces such effects.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all wooden beams and structural supports been replaced with meticulously cut, multifaceted crystal edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any wooden beams or supports; instead, it features a completely different construction paradigm. The edges of the structure are sharp and multifaceted, resembling the edges of a crystal. This observation is based on the absence of any organic or rough textures that would be present in wood and the presence of precise, clean lines characteristic of crystalline structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the crystal structure resting on a flat, white marble platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the structure in Image B appears to be a smooth, flat surface with a white coloration that resembles marble. The platform provides a stark contrast to the colorful and complex geometry of the crystal structure above it, which suggests its purpose as a foundation for display. The texture and uniformity of the platform further support the interpretation of it being made of marble or a similar material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small crystal formations present as decorative accents along the base of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Around the base of the structure in Image B, there are smaller objects that share the same aesthetic qualities as the main structureâ€”transparent, faceted, and reflecting similar hues. Their placement around the base suggests they serve a decorative function, complementing the larger crystal structure. These smaller formations enhance the overall crystalline theme of the image.",
