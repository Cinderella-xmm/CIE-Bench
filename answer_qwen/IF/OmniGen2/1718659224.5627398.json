      "question": "Is the fortress constructed entirely from golden-brown cookie dough with darker edges resembling baked edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fortress in Image B appears to be a miniature structure with a golden-brown color and darker edges that resemble the appearance of baked cookie dough. The texture and coloration are consistent with what one would expect from a cookie, suggesting it is indeed constructed from cookie dough.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the walls and towers of the fortress have a golden-brown base color with visibly darker edges, mimicking baked cookie dough?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the walls and towers of the fortress exhibit a golden-brown base color with visibly darker edges, which is characteristic of baked cookie dough. This visual cue, combined with the overall appearance of the structure, supports the conclusion that they are designed to mimic cookie dough.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls depicted as finely piped, smooth, and glossy streams resembling royal icing rather than natural water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waterfalls in Image B are depicted as smooth, glossy streams with a uniform blue color and white highlights, resembling royal icing rather than natural water. The texture and sheen are indicative of a piped icing application, not realistic water features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are uniformly green with a smooth texture and lack detailed leaf patterns, which is typical of marzipan decorations. Their appearance suggests they are made from marzipan rather than being realistic representations of trees.",
