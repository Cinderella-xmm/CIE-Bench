      "question": "Is the crocodile depicted with flat, solid color regions and exaggerated features characteristic of pop art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crocodile in Image B is depicted with flat, solid color regions and exaggerated features. The use of bright, uniform colors without gradients or shading is characteristic of pop art. Additionally, the features such as the eyes, teeth, and body are stylized and exaggerated for a bold visual impact. This analysis is based on the visual cues present in Image B alone.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the edges of the crocodile, hat, and sunglasses defined by bold, continuous black outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the crocodile, hat, and sunglasses are indeed defined by bold, continuous black outlines. These outlines are thick and unbroken, which is a common technique in pop art to emphasize shapes and create a graphic quality. This conclusion is drawn from observing the clear demarcations between different elements in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the hat and sunglasses rendered in highly saturated, vivid neon colors (e.g., electric pink, lime green, hot orange)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hat and sunglasses in Image B are rendered in highly saturated, vivid neon colors. The hat features electric pink and other bright hues, while the sunglasses have frames that appear to be in a similar vibrant tone. These colors are typical of pop art's tendency to use eye-catching, unnatural shades to create a striking effect.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the crocodileâ€™s scales been replaced with a consistent, repeating geometric pattern (e.g., squares, rectangles, or dots)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scales of the crocodile in Image B have been replaced with a consistent, repeating geometric pattern. Instead of realistic scales, the body is covered with a mosaic-like arrangement of squares and rectangles in various colors. This transformation aligns with pop art's style of simplifying and abstracting natural textures into geometric forms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit high color contrast between the crocodile, hat, sunglasses, and background, with minimal shading and a stylized, graphic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits high color contrast between the crocodile, hat, sunglasses, and background. The yellow background contrasts sharply with the blue and pink of the crocodile and accessories. There is minimal shading, and the overall appearance is stylized and graphic, emphasizing the pop art aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the crocodile still in the same pose and position as in the original image, with the hat on its head and sunglasses over its eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the pose and position of the crocodile have changed. In Image A, the crocodile appears more naturalistic and is not wearing a hat or sunglasses. In Image B, the crocodile is in a more upright, anthropomorphic pose, wearing a hat and sunglasses, indicating a significant alteration in its depiction.",
