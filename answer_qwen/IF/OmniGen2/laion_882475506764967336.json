      "question": "Are the table and chairs visibly constructed from LEGO bricks with interlocking patterns and stud details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The table and chairs in Image B exhibit a distinct LEGO aesthetic, with visible interlocking patterns and stud details that are characteristic of LEGO bricks. The uniformity and modular nature of the construction suggest they are indeed made from LEGO bricks. This conclusion is drawn by observing the consistent size and shape of the components and their assembly style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the tabletop and chair seats feature interlocking LEGO brick patterns consistent with modular construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tabletop and chair seats in Image B display a clear pattern of LEGO studs, which are typical for LEGO brick surfaces. These patterns indicate a modular construction method where individual bricks are connected to form larger structures. The analysis is based on the visual texture and arrangement of the studs, which align with common LEGO design principles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a LEGO-style plant element placed in the center of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small plant element placed centrally on the table. It has a LEGO-style appearance with a green foliage part and a brown trunk, resembling a simplified tree or plant model commonly found in LEGO sets. This observation is based on its placement, color, and design consistency with LEGO elements.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the furniture placed on a flat, gray LEGO baseplate that replaces the original concrete patio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The furniture in Image B is situated on a flat, gray surface that resembles a LEGO baseplate. This baseplate lacks the detailed texture of a concrete patio and instead features a grid of circular studs typical of LEGO construction bases. Comparing this to the original concrete patio in Image A confirms the replacement with a LEGO-style baseplate.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are background elements like the wooden fence, potted plants, and outdoor lighting removed or simplified to create a clean, uncluttered environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Background elements such as the wooden fence, potted plants, and outdoor lighting present in Image A are notably absent in Image B. The background in Image B is simplified to focus solely on the LEGO furniture and baseplate, creating a clean and uncluttered environment. This change enhances the focus on the LEGO elements and removes distractions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all LEGO bricks used in the furniture exclusively brown and amber in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO bricks used for the furniture in Image B are primarily brown and amber in color. These colors are consistently applied across the table and chairs, reflecting a limited but deliberate color palette. There are no other colors visible in the furniture, confirming the exclusive use of brown and amber LEGO bricks.",
