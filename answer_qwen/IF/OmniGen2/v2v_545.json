      "question": "Is the sparrow depicted in a 3D-rendered form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sparrow in Image B appears to have smooth, uniform surfaces and lacks the fine details and textures typically seen in real-world photographs. The lighting is consistent and idealized, suggesting a controlled environment typical of 3D rendering. Additionally, the edges are sharp and clean, which is characteristic of digital models rather than natural photography.",

      "question": "Does the image exhibit the animation style characteristic of Pixar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the sparrow in Image B has a polished and detailed appearance that could be associated with high-quality animation, it does not specifically exhibit the distinctive stylistic elements commonly associated with Pixar animations, such as exaggerated expressions or specific color palettes. Therefore, based on visual cues alone, it cannot be conclusively identified as Pixar's style.",

      "question": "Is the sparrow perched on the wooden chair in a realistic manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sparrow in Image B is positioned on the chair in a way that mimics natural behavior, with its claws gripping the edge. However, the lack of subtle imperfections and the overly smooth texture suggest it may not fully replicate the nuances of a real bird's posture. Comparing with Image A, where the bird's feathers and claws show more detail and variation, Image B seems less realistic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the textures on the sparrow and the chair appear polished and detailed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the sparrow and the chair display a high level of polish and detail. The sparrow's feathers have clear patterns and gradients, and the chair's wood grain is visible and well-defined. This level of refinement suggests a deliberate design choice to enhance the visual appeal, which is common in 3D renders.",

      "question": "Are the colors in the image rich and lively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B are vibrant and well-saturated, giving the sparrow and the chair a lively appearance. The lighting enhances these colors, making them stand out against the neutral background. Compared to Image A, where the colors might be more subdued due to natural lighting conditions, Image B's colors are indeed richer and more vivid.",
