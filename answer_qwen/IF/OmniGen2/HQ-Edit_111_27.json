      "question": "Does the geisha's figure appear as a stained glass artwork with distinct lead-like outlines separating colored sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The geisha's figure in Image B is clearly depicted with distinct lead-like outlines that separate various colored sections, resembling the style of stained glass. This is evident from the black lines that define the edges of different colors and shapes, mimicking the look of lead cames used in traditional stained glass art. The visual cues such as these outlines and the segmented color blocks strongly suggest a stained glass effect.",

      "question": "Are the kimono patterns composed of flowing, curvilinear organic designs such as vines or flowers, rendered in vivid jewel tones (e.g., deep reds, blues, greens)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono patterns are indeed composed of flowing, curvilinear organic designs like vines or flowers. These designs are rendered in vivid jewel tones including deep reds, blues, and greens. The use of bright, saturated colors and the fluid, natural forms align with the characteristics of organic motifs often found in Art Nouveau and similar styles, which emphasize nature-inspired elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cherry blossoms in Image B are depicted with segmented petals, dark outlines, and translucent coloring, consistent with the appearance of stained glass.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand fan in Image B has been replaced with a peacock-style fan featuring eye-patterned feathers and iridescent, multi-colored surfaces.

      "question": "Is the background composed of curving, interwoven lines and shaded areas forming an abstract mosaic pattern consistent with Art Nouveau design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of curving, interwoven lines and shaded areas forming an abstract mosaic pattern that is characteristic of Art Nouveau design. The flowing lines and organic shapes create a sense of movement and harmony, which are key elements of Art Nouveau aesthetics. The abstract nature of the background further supports this analysis.",
