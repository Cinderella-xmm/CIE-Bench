    "Question": "Q6: Does the image maintain a 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio?",
    "explanation": "The image appears to be square-shaped, meaning its width and height are equal. A 3:2 aspect ratio would imply that the width is 1.5 times the height, which is not the case here. Therefore, the image does not maintain a 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio.",
    "answer": "No"
