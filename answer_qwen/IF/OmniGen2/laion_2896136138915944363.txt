    "Question": "Q4:"
    "explanation": "The text 'Shoreline Explorer Set' does appear on the packaging in Image B.

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:"

}

{
    "Question": "Q7:"
    "explanation": "The binocular-shaped cut-out in Image B does not reveal internal components of the birdwatching kit.
