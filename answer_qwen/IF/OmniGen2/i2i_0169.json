      "question": "Has a small husky been added to the image, positioned close behind the skating child?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible dog-like figure with distinct features such as pointed ears, a bushy tail, and a coat pattern typical of a husky. It is positioned directly behind the child on skis, suggesting it has been added to the scene. The analysis is based on the visual characteristics of the animal and its placement relative to the child.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the snowy mountain at the top left been replaced with a minimalist, futuristic, transparent ski dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background at the top left shows a large, smooth, curved structure that resembles a dome. Its design is simple and modern, with a translucent appearance allowing light to pass through, which is not characteristic of natural snowy mountains. This suggests the mountain has been replaced with a ski dome.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the husky positioned appropriately so it appears to be closely trailing the skating child?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The husky in Image B is placed right behind the child, maintaining a realistic distance that would suggest it is running alongside or slightly behind the child. The alignment and spacing between the husky and the child appear natural, indicating appropriate positioning.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the new ski dome feature a minimalist design with futuristic elements and appear transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The structure in Image B has a clean, uncluttered design with smooth lines and a lack of intricate details, aligning with minimalist aesthetics. Its translucent material allows visibility of the sky and surroundings, contributing to a futuristic look. These observations confirm the presence of minimalist and futuristic elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the added elements (husky and ski dome) blend seamlessly into the image without disrupting the scene's realism or original composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the husky and ski dome are visually integrated into the scene, their addition alters the original context significantly. The ski dome replaces a natural mountainous backdrop, and the presence of a running husky introduces an element not typically seen in skiing scenes. These changes disrupt the original realism and composition to some extent.",
