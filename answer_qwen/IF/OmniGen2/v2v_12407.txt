{
    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The mango in Image B is depicted with a blocky, pixelated appearance that is characteristic of 8-bit graphics. The edges are not smooth but rather composed of large, visible pixels, which is typical for low-resolution images from early video games and digital art. This style uses pixelation to represent shapes and details.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the table and napkin are rendered with a very simplified and low-resolution appearance. The lines and shapes are composed of large pixels, lacking fine detail, which aligns with the aesthetic of 8-bit graphics where complex textures are reduced to basic forms due to resolution constraints.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "Image B employs a limited color palette, using only a few distinct colors for the mango, table, and napkin. This is consistent with 8-bit graphics, which were constrained by technology to use fewer colors, resulting in a simplified visual presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The shadows and highlights on the mango and table in Image B are indeed simplified, with flat shading that lacks the gradient transitions seen in higher-resolution images. This flatness is typical of 8-bit graphics, where shading is often represented by solid blocks of color rather than smooth gradients.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The overall composition of Image B focuses on basic shapes and forms rather than detailed textures. The mango, table, and napkin are represented with simple geometric shapes and minimal detail, which is characteristic of 8-bit graphics aiming for clarity and recognizability within technical limitations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
