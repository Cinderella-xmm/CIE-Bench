      "question": "Is the black dog depicted in a chibi-style with exaggerated, cute features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black dog in Image B does not exhibit exaggerated, cute features typical of chibi-style art. Chibi characters usually have large heads, small bodies, and simplified features, which are not present here. The dog appears realistically proportioned with naturalistic details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag rendered in a minimalist flat design without gradients or 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag appear to be rendered in a minimalist flat design. There are no visible gradients or 3D effects; the objects are depicted with simple shapes and solid colors, consistent with a flat design aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black dog the most prominent element in the illustration, with its distinct characteristics preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black dog is indeed the most prominent element in the illustration. Its size relative to other elements and its central placement draw attention. The distinct characteristics of the dog, such as its fur texture and posture, are preserved despite the stylized rendering.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a bold white outline around the perimeter of the circular frame. This outline serves to separate the illustration from the background and emphasizes the circular shape of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Neither the dog nor the bench extends beyond the circular frame in Image B. All elements are contained within the boundaries of the circle, maintaining a neat and cohesive composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background of the illustration transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the illustration in Image B is not transparent. It is filled with a solid white color that contrasts with the circular frame containing the scene, indicating an opaque background.",
