      "question": "Has the train been transformed into a futuristic maglev train design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train in Image B exhibits a streamlined, aerodynamic shape typical of high-speed maglev trains. The absence of traditional wheels and the presence of a sleek body suggest it is designed for magnetic levitation technology. This conclusion is drawn from visual cues such as the smooth undercarriage and the overall modern aesthetic, which align with common knowledge about maglev trains.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the train retain the original white and red color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the train with a predominantly white body and a red stripe along its side, consistent with a white and red color scheme. Comparing this to Image A, where the same color scheme is present on a more conventional train, it can be concluded that the color scheme has been retained despite the design transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the train incorporate elements indicative of maglev technology?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train in Image B lacks visible wheels and instead has a smooth underbody, which is characteristic of maglev trains that use magnetic forces for levitation and propulsion. These visual cues, combined with the streamlined design, suggest the incorporation of maglev technology elements.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the train still appear recognizable as a train despite the futuristic changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the futuristic design, the train in Image B retains features such as windows, doors, and an elongated body shape that are typical of trains. These elements, along with its position on tracks, make it recognizable as a train even with the advanced design modifications.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have all parts of the original train been transformed into the new maglev design, with no elements of the old design remaining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train appears entirely reimagined with a futuristic maglev design. There are no visible remnants of the original train's design, such as traditional wheels or a less aerodynamic shape, indicating a complete transformation into the new design.",
