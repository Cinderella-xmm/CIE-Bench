      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title 'Butterfly Biology Basics' is clearly visible at the top of the image in large, bold font. This placement is common for titles in infographics as it immediately informs the viewer about the content's subject matter.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are pink flower petals included in the image near the butterfly. Given that butterflies often feed on nectar from flowers, the inclusion of these petals likely represents the butterfly’s feeding preference and its interaction with flora.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image includes several text boxes with accompanying illustrations. While the exact content of the text is not fully legible, the presence of these text boxes alongside images of flowers and insects suggests they may explain the butterfly’s role in pollination. However, without clear text, this cannot be confirmed definitively.",
