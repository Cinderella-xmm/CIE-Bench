{
    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "The edited image shows a single scene with a horse grazing near a body of water and houses in the background. There are no visual cues indicating multiple frames or any skater's motion. The image appears to be a continuous, singular photograph without segmentation into separate frames.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "Since there is only one frame in the edited image depicting a horse grazing, it does not contain any elements related to a skater's motion such as push-off, ground contact, or forward lean. Therefore, it is not possible for three frames to show these actions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "The edited image maintains a realistic style consistent with a natural landscape photograph. It features a horse, water, and distant houses, all rendered in a manner that aligns with real-world imagery. There are no apparent stylistic distortions or alterations that would suggest otherwise.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:"
    "explanation": "There are no visible motion trajectory lines in the edited image. The image depicts a static scene with a horse grazing, and no elements suggest movement or trajectory paths.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:"
    "explanation": "As the edited image consists of a single frame without any indication of multiple frames being combined, the concept of cohesion among frames does not apply here. The image is cohesive within its own context as a single photograph.",
    "answer": "No"
