      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "One of the postcards in Image B features a blue gradient that emphasizes an embroidered dress. This is evident from the prominent display of the dress with detailed embroidery, which stands out due to its vibrant blue color and intricate design. The conclusion is drawn by focusing on the visual prominence and thematic consistency of the dress within the postcard.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "One of the postcards in Image B is rendered in silver tones, specifically emphasizing a hair accessory.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "One of the postcards in Image B incorporates stylized bamboo patterns as a dominant visual element. This is clear from the depiction of bamboo stalks and leaves arranged in a way that draws attention to their form and structure. The conclusion is reached by identifying the natural motifs and their artistic rendering.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The postcards in Image B are not presented within a silk-bound book whose cover features an embroidery-inspired design. Instead, they are laid out individually on a flat surface. There is no indication of a book or any binding present in the image. The analysis is based on the absence of any book-like structures or covers in the visual composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral and scroll motifs on the garment in Image B do not exhibit stylized paper-cut effects such as sharp edges, layered appearance, and high contrast. Instead, the embroidery appears smooth and integrated into the fabric's texture, lacking the starkness typically associated with paper cuts. The conclusion is drawn by comparing the visual characteristics of the embroidery with those expected in paper-cut art.",
