    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image presented within a visible hand-carved wooden frame that encloses the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is clearly enclosed within a wooden frame that has a smooth, polished finish. The edges of the frame are visible and surround the entire scene, suggesting it is hand-carved or crafted to contain the artwork. This conclusion is drawn from observing the uniformity and craftsmanship of the frame.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the boat, water, and hills depicted as separate, layered cutout elements rather than a continuous photographic scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boat, water, and hills appear as distinct cutout elements with clean edges and separate layers. The boat is positioned on top of the water layer, which in turn is above the hill layer. This layered construction is evident from the shadows and spacing between each element, indicating they are not part of a continuous photographic scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the boat exhibit aged wood textures such as cracks, grain patterns, and weathered surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boat does not exhibit aged wood textures such as cracks, grain patterns, or weathered surfaces. Instead, it appears smooth and uniformly colored, suggesting a new or idealized representation rather than an aged one. This observation is based on the lack of visible imperfections or textural details typically associated with aged wood.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the distant hills rendered in soft, pastel blue gradients instead of realistic green or gray tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The distant hills are rendered in soft, pastel blue gradients. This can be observed by noting the gentle transitions of color and the absence of sharp contrasts or realistic tones like green or gray. The use of pastel blues gives the scene a serene and artistic quality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible, delicate droplet-like etchings on a transparent layer above the water surface to mimic ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no visible droplet-like etchings on a transparent layer above the water surface. Instead, the ripples are depicted through subtle lines and shading directly on the water layer, creating the illusion of movement without the need for additional transparent elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the foreground (boat), midground (water), and background (hills) appear as distinct, physically separated layers contributing to depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foreground (boat), midground (water), and background (hills) are indeed distinct, physically separated layers contributing to depth. This is evident from the clear separation and layering of each element, with shadows and spacing enhancing the three-dimensional effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
