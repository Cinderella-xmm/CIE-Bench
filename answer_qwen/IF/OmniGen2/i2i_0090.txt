    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image show the stapler from both the front and rear views side by side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are two distinct sections of the stapler visible. On the left side, we see a complete stapler with its front view showing the hinge mechanism and metallic parts. On the right side, only the rear part of another stapler is shown, lacking the front components like the hinge and metal plates. This arrangement suggests that the front and rear views are indeed placed side by side.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the stapler's front and rear views arranged next to each other in a horizontal alignment?",
    "explanation": "The stapler's front view on the left and the rear view on the right are aligned horizontally across the image. There is no vertical stacking or diagonal placement; they are clearly positioned side by side along the same horizontal line.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are all parts of the stapler visible in both the front and rear views without any truncation?",
    "explanation": "In the front view (left side), all parts of the stapler, including the hinge and metallic components, are visible. However, in the rear view (right side), only the back portion of the stapler is shown, missing the front components such as the hinge and metal plates. Therefore, not all parts are visible in the rear view.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the front and rear views of the stapler in the edited image match in terms of color and design details?",
    "explanation": "The front view shows a blue stapler with metallic parts, while the rear view displays an orange stapler. The colors do not match, and the design details differ due to the absence of the front components in the rear view. Thus, they do not match in terms of color and design details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the background consistent between the front and rear views of the stapler without additional elements introduced?",
    "explanation": "Both the front and rear views share a similar green background. However, the rear view introduces an orange hue that wasn't present in the original image, indicating a change in the background for that section. Therefore, the background is not entirely consistent.",
    "answer": "No"
