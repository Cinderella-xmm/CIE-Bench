      "question": "Is the overall scene rendered in a pop art style with bright, flat colors and comic book-like aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image exhibits characteristics typical of pop art, such as bright, flat colors and a comic book-like aesthetic. The use of solid, vivid colors without gradients or shading, along with the halftone dot patterns in the sky, supports this conclusion. These elements are hallmarks of pop art style, which often draws inspiration from comic books and advertising.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the train feature bold primary colors (such as red, blue, or yellow) and halftone dot patterns on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train in the image is depicted using bold primary colors—blue for the body and yellow for the side panels. Additionally, there are halftone dot patterns visible on the surface of the train, particularly around the windows and doors. This combination of primary colors and halftone dots is consistent with pop art techniques used to create a stylized, graphic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the barn’s wooden texture been replaced with stylized geometric shapes instead of realistic wood grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The barn in the image does not display realistic wood grain textures. Instead, it appears to have a simplified, stylized design with clean lines and uniform color blocks. While it retains some geometric shapes that suggest its structure, the lack of detailed texture indicates a departure from realistic depiction towards a more abstract representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the trees and grass been converted into vibrant, abstract, graphic bursts rather than realistic vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees and grass in the image are rendered in vibrant, abstract forms rather than realistic vegetation. The foliage is depicted with bold colors and lacks detailed textures, instead appearing as graphic bursts of color. This abstraction aligns with the overall pop art style of the image, emphasizing form and color over realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all major elements in the image (train, barn, tracks, foliage) outlined with sharp, black lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All major elements in the image—the train, barn, tracks, and foliage—are outlined with sharp, black lines. These outlines define the edges of each element clearly, creating a strong contrast against the bright, flat colors. This technique is common in pop art to enhance the graphic quality and visual impact of the image.",
