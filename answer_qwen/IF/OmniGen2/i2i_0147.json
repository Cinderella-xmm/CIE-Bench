      "question": "Has melted cheese been added on top of the hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible layer of yellow substance on top of the hot dog that appears to be melted cheese. This conclusion is drawn from its smooth texture and the way it drips slightly over the edges of the sausage, which is characteristic of melted cheese. The color and consistency align with common knowledge about how cheese behaves when heated.",

      "question": "Have fried onions been added on top of the hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows curly, golden-brown strands on top of the melted cheese, which resemble fried onions based on their shape, color, and typical appearance in food presentations. These are not typically part of a standard hot dog topping, suggesting they have been added for extra flavor or texture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is a metallic object near the grill that resembles a barbecue tong. Its placement and design, including the handle and gripping ends, are consistent with what one would expect from a tool used for handling food on a grill.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the additions of toppings, the hot dog bun and sausage remain clearly visible in Image B. The bun's structure and the sausage's shape can be identified beneath the melted cheese and fried onions, indicating that these core elements of the hot dog are still present and recognizable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grill grates are visible beneath the hot dog, and there are bright orange-yellow areas that resemble flames. These visual cues suggest an active cooking environment, which is consistent with the presence of a grill and flames as seen in typical outdoor cooking setups.",
