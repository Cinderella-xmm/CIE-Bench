      "question": "Is the overall shape of the object now clearly that of an owl rather than a teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B has distinct features such as large, round eyes with a glowing effect and ear tufts that are characteristic of an owl. The body shape is rounded and compact, resembling an owl's silhouette rather than the elongated form typical of a teapot. The visual cues combined with common knowledge about owls lead to the conclusion that the overall shape is now clearly that of an owl.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lid of the original teapot form the crown-like head of the owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top part of the object resembles an owl's head with intricate patterns that could be interpreted as a crown-like structure. This area aligns with where the lid would have been on the original teapot. By comparing this with the typical placement of a teapot lid and considering the ornate design, it can be deduced that the lid has indeed been transformed into the owl's head.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original engravings now transformed into metallic feather-like patterns covering the owl's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the object in Image B displays detailed metallic patterns that resemble feathers. These patterns are consistent with the engravings seen on the original teapot but have been reimagined to fit the theme of an owl's plumage. The transformation from engravings to feather-like patterns is evident through the visual comparison and understanding of how engravings can be artistically repurposed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the spout been reshaped into a sharp, mechanical beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spout in Image B appears sharp and angular, positioned where a beak would naturally be on an owl. This contrasts with the smooth, curved spout typically found on a teapot. The mechanical appearance suggests a deliberate redesign to mimic a beak, combining visual analysis with the concept of functional adaptation in design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the handle been transformed into a gracefully curved tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle in Image B does not resemble a tail; instead, it maintains its original curved shape as part of the teapot design. A gracefully curved tail would likely extend outward or downward from the body, which is not observed here. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest the handle has been transformed into a tail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two glowing eyes made of cogs visible on the owl's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes in Image B are large, circular, and have a glowing effect, composed of what appear to be cogs or gears. This unique design integrates mechanical elements with biological features, creating a steampunk aesthetic. The presence of these glowing, cog-like eyes is clear and distinct, confirming their existence on the owl's face.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the owl positioned on a richly carved wooden branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the owl perched on a wooden branch with visible grain and texture, suggesting a natural setting. The branch is richly carved, adding an artistic touch that complements the owl's design. This detail is observable and aligns with the idea of an owl being depicted in a naturalistic yet stylized manner.",
