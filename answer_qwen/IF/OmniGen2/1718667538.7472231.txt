{
    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The tiger figure in Image B is depicted with clean, sharp lines and lacks the depth and texture typically associated with realistic shading. The edges are well-defined, resembling cut-paper art where each element appears as a separate layer. This style is common in traditional paper crafts and illustrations that aim for a flat, stylized appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The stripes on the tiger's face in Image B are bold and exaggerated compared to natural tiger markings. They are wider and more uniform, which is characteristic of stylized representations rather than realistic depictions. Natural tiger stripes tend to be thinner and more irregular.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The whiskers on the tiger in Image B are indeed longer and thicker than what would be seen on a real tiger. In nature, tiger whiskers are fine and relatively short. The elongated and prominent depiction here enhances the artistic and stylized nature of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The kimono in Image B has a design that suggests it is made up of multiple overlapping layers, each with distinct edges. This layered effect is typical of cut-paper art, where each piece is carefully placed to create a cohesive whole. The clear delineation between different parts of the garment supports this observation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "Upon examining the cherry blossom patterns on the kimono in Image B, there are no shiny, metallic gold accents visible. The colors appear matte and consistent with the overall flat, paper-cut aesthetic of the image. Metallic elements would introduce a reflective quality not present here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:",
    "explanation": "There are no visible perforations, tabs, or fold lines indicating detachable sections in Image B. The image maintains a continuous and unified appearance without any interruptions that would suggest separable parts. Such features would typically be evident if they were part of the design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7:",
    "explanation": "While the image has a layered look, there are no explicit fold lines or structural elements suggesting physical interaction such as folding. The design focuses on a flat, visual representation rather than incorporating functional folds or creases.",
    "answer": "No"
