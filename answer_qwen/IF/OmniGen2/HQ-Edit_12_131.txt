{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The bold moko patterns on the warrior's face and body are visible but appear simplified compared to traditional moko designs.

}

{
    "Question": "Q8:",
    "explanation": "There are only two stat bars visible on the card, labeled 'Courage +10 Mangay' and 'Rhynch Ledershiip'.
