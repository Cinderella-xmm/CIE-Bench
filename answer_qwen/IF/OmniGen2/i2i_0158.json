      "question": "Is the front view of the car clearly visible in the final three-view combination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top section shows a side profile of a blue car. The front grille and headlights are partially visible but not fully shown as they are angled away from the viewer. This suggests that while some elements of the front view are present, it is not a direct or clear frontal perspective. Therefore, based on this analysis, the front view is not clearly visible.",

      "question": "Is the left side view of the car clearly visible in the final three-view combination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The middle section of Image B displays a red car with a clear side profile. The entire length of the car, including windows, wheels, and body lines, is visible without obstruction. This indicates that the left side view is indeed clearly visible. Comparing this to Image A, where the side view is also clear but includes environmental context, the focus here is solely on the car's design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom section of Image B presents a rear view of a blue car. All key features such as the taillights, rear bumper, and license plate area are visible and distinct. This confirms that the rear view is clearly visible. In comparison to Image A, which does not show a rear view, this specific angle provides a complete look at the back of the vehicle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the three views of the car presented in a non-overlapping manner, ensuring they are distinct and clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each section of Image B (top, middle, and bottom) contains a separate view of the car without any overlap between them. The distinct separation ensures that each view—side, front, and rear—is easily distinguishable and clearly visible. This layout allows for an unambiguous presentation of the car from different angles.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall presentation of the combined three-view image align with the standards suitable for car magazines or showroom flyers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout in Image B is clean and professional, with each car view distinctly separated and clearly presented. Such a format is commonly used in car magazines and showroom flyers to showcase various angles of a vehicle. The inclusion of text descriptions further enhances its suitability for these mediums. Thus, the presentation aligns well with industry standards.",
