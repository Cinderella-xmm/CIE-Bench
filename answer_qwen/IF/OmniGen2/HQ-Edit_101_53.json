    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pug depicted as a carved wooden sculpture rather than a living dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pug is depicted with a texture and appearance that closely resembles carved wood. The surface lacks the softness and natural variations typical of living fur, instead showing polished wood grain patterns. This suggests that the pug has been artistically rendered as a wooden sculpture rather than a real dog.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the fur been replaced with smooth, polished wood grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture on the pug in Image B is smooth and exhibits a polished wood grain pattern, which is distinctly different from the fluffy or soft appearance of fur. This indicates that the fur has indeed been replaced with a wood grain texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors of the sculpture consistent with walnut tones, maintaining the original pug's color pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B are consistent with walnut tones, featuring rich browns and subtle variations that mimic the natural coloration of wood. These colors align with the original pug's color pattern but in a wooden context, suggesting an artistic interpretation rather than a literal representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and features represented by etched or carved lines rather than soft skin folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features of the pug in Image B are represented by etched or carved lines, which give the impression of being meticulously crafted into the wood. These lines replace the soft skin folds that would be present on a living dog, further emphasizing the sculpture's wooden nature.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pug in Image B is placed on a simple black base. This base appears to be smooth and contrasts sharply with the detailed wood texture of the sculpture, providing a stable and elegant platform for the artwork.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
