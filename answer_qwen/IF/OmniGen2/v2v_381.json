      "question": "Has the original pyramid been converted into five adorable chibi-style Russian nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual content clearly shows a set of five Russian nesting dolls with chibi-style features. These dolls are characterized by their cartoonish and cute appearance, which is distinct from the architectural structure of a pyramid. The conversion from a pyramid to these dolls is evident through the change in shape, design, and context. There is no indication of a pyramid in this image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls feature pyramid-inspired designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B do not exhibit any design elements that resemble a pyramid. They have a traditional Russian doll aesthetic with colorful patterns and human-like faces. Pyramid-inspired designs would typically include triangular shapes or motifs related to pyramids, which are absent here.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls arranged in descending size order?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the arrangement of the nesting dolls in Image B, they are indeed placed in a sequence where each subsequent doll is smaller than the one before it. This is a common way to display nesting dolls, as it visually represents how they fit inside each other.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls placed on a sophisticated wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B are positioned on what appears to be a polished wooden surface with a rich brown tone and visible wood grain, suggesting sophistication. The craftsmanship of the table complements the decorative nature of the dolls.",

      "question": "Does the edited image have a horizontal 3:2 aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the aspect ratio, we need to consider the dimensions of the image. A 3:2 aspect ratio means the width is 1.5 times the height. By visually inspecting Image B, it appears square-shaped, indicating equal width and height, thus not fitting the 3:2 ratio.",
