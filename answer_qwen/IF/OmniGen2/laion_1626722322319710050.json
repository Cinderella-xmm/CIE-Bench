      "question": "Is the statue and its base fully enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue and its base are clearly visible within a transparent glass dome. The dome is sealed at the top with a spherical knob, and there are no gaps or openings that suggest the statue is not fully enclosed. This conclusion is drawn from observing the continuity of the glass structure around the entire object.",

      "question": "Has the statue been transformed into a sleek, metallic 3D figure with a reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue in Image B appears to have a reflective metallic surface, which contrasts with typical stone statues. The light reflections and highlights on the figure indicate a smooth, polished material resembling metal. This analysis is based on the visual cues of reflectivity and sheen observed on the statue's surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small-scale trees with translucent or semi-transparent leaves surrounding the metallic figure inside the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the glass dome in Image B, there are small-scale trees positioned around the statue. These trees have leaves that appear translucent or semi-transparent, as they allow some light to pass through while still being visibly detailed. This observation is made by noting the texture and light transmission properties of the leaves.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the base of the miniature scene in Image B, there are small engraved plaques with text. These plaques are located on the sides of the circular base and contain inscriptions that resemble historical or descriptive text. This conclusion is reached by identifying the presence of these plaques and their placement relative to the rest of the scene.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stand beneath the glass dome in Image B features a polished stone-like surface with intricate patterns that resemble delicate vines. These patterns are etched into the surface, adding an ornate detail to the base. This analysis is based on the visual inspection of the design and texture of the stand.",
