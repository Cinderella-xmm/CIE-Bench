    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire bottle constructed entirely from LEGO bricks, with no realistic glass or plastic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottle in Image B appears to be a realistic glass or plastic bottle with smooth surfaces and reflections typical of such materials. There are no visible blocky structures or gaps that would suggest LEGO construction. The edges and form are consistent with molded glass or plastic, not the interlocking bricks of LEGO.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the body and sides of the bottle built using translucent green LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body and sides of the bottle in Image B are smooth and translucent green, resembling a real liquid inside a transparent container. This is inconsistent with LEGO bricks, which would show distinct block boundaries and lack the fluid appearance. Therefore, it's clear that LEGO bricks are not used for the bottle's body.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the label area composed of multicolored LEGO blocks representing the original design elements (logo, text, colors)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label area in Image B features a continuous design with printed text and logos, showing no signs of being composed of individual LEGO blocks. The elements like logo and text are sharp and uniform, unlike what would be expected from multicolored LEGO blocks representing these details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cap made from smooth, circular blue LEGO bricks and does it maintain a cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap in Image B is a smooth, solid blue color with a cylindrical shape, typical of a molded plastic or metal cap on a beverage bottle. It lacks the segmented or blocky texture that would be present if constructed from LEGO bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO bottle placed on a minimalist white shelf against a neutral or white background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bottle placed on a minimalist white shelf against a neutral background. This setup is common for product photography to highlight the item without distractions. There are no indications that the shelf or background are made of LEGO.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all brand texts (e.g., \"Bacardi,\" \"Mojito,\" \"Classic Cocktails\") visibly rendered in blocky LEGO-style lettering and legible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brand texts on the label in Image B are rendered in a smooth, professional font style typical of printed labels. They do not exhibit the blocky, pixelated characteristics that would be associated with LEGO-style lettering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the LEGO bottle display clear sculptural features such as defined edges, depth, and 3D form to emphasize its construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottle in Image B displays smooth contours and a realistic 3D form typical of a manufactured bottle. While it has defined edges and depth, these features are consistent with a real object rather than emphasizing LEGO-like sculptural construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
