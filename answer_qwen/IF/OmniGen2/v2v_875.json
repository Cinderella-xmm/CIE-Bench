      "question": "Is the palm tree and cactus positioned within the frame of a Polaroid photograph being held by a human hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm tree and cactus are clearly visible within the rectangular frame of a Polaroid photograph. The edges of the Polaroid are white with rounded corners, typical of such instant photographs. A human hand is holding this Polaroid from behind, as indicated by the fingers gripping the edges. This setup suggests that the scene is being presented as a captured moment within a physical photograph.",

      "question": "Has the cactus been transformed into a 3D chibi-style character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cactus in Image B has not been transformed into a 3D chibi-style character. It retains its natural form and proportions, consistent with a realistic depiction of a cactus. There are no exaggerated features or stylized elements that would suggest a chibi transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cactus appear to be stepping out of the Polaroid frame, breaking into the real-world 3D space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cactus in Image B remains entirely within the boundaries of the Polaroid frame. There are no visual cues indicating that it is stepping out or breaking into the real-world 3D space. The entire scene, including the cactus, appears to be contained within the two-dimensional plane of the photograph.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image create a whimsical and surreal effect through the combination of the Polaroid frame, the chibi cactus, and the real-world interaction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does create a whimsical and surreal effect. The combination of the Polaroid frame, which typically represents a static captured moment, with the inclusion of a small chibi-style character adds an element of fantasy. The juxtaposition of these elements against the backdrop of a desert scene contributes to a surreal atmosphere. However, since the cactus itself has not been transformed into a chibi style, the surreal effect is primarily due to the presence of the chibi character and the overall composition rather than the cactus.",

      "question": "Is the palm tree still present and unchanged in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm tree in Image B is still present and appears unchanged compared to Image A. Its position, size, and details remain consistent with the original image. The only difference is that it is now part of the Polaroid photograph held by a hand, but its intrinsic characteristics have not been altered.",
