      "question": "Are the athlete's muscles visibly exaggerated in a comic-book style, with enhanced definition and volume?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the athlete's muscles are depicted with a high level of definition and volume that surpasses what is typically seen in real-life athletes. The musculature appears overly pronounced and idealized, which is characteristic of comic-book art styles where physical features are exaggerated for dramatic effect. This style aims to convey strength and power in a visually striking manner.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boxing gloves in Image B are indeed predominantly fiery red, and they feature gold accents such as trim or highlights.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is a blank rectangular panel positioned on the side of Image B, which appears to be intended for a motivational quote. This design choice is common in promotional or inspirational posters where space is left for text that can vary depending on the context or audience. The placement and size suggest it is meant to complement the visual elements without overpowering them.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is presented as three distinct but unified prints arranged side by side, forming a triptych. This format is often used for wall art in gyms or other spaces where a larger, more immersive visual experience is desired. Each section contributes to the overall composition while maintaining its individuality, making it suitable for display as gym wall art.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B does not include bold, large-scale typography within the main visual area, there is text present in the blank rectangular panel on the side. However, this text is not part of the central imagery and does not contribute significantly to the energetic and sporty aesthetic of the main figure and background. Therefore, based on the central focus of the image, the answer is no.",
