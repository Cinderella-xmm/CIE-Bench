      "question": "Has the floral headdress been transformed into a chibi-style headpiece with exaggerated, rounded, and simplified forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral headdress features large, vibrant flowers that are not exaggerated or simplified in a chibi style. The flowers retain their natural form and detail, which is inconsistent with chibi-style design that typically involves more cartoonish and simplified shapes. Therefore, based on the visual cues and common understanding of chibi aesthetics, the transformation described has not occurred.",

      "question": "Are the orange and yellow flowers in the headpiece rendered with vivid, saturated hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flowers in Image B display bright and intense colors, characteristic of high saturation. The orange and yellow petals stand out sharply against the background, indicating that they have indeed been rendered with vivid, saturated hues. This conclusion is drawn from observing the color intensity and clarity in the image.",

      "question": "Has the black, orange, and yellow braided hair been integrated into the chibi-style headpiece as part of its design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The braided hair in Image B appears to be styled naturally with no signs of being integrated into a chibi-style design. It maintains a realistic texture and structure, separate from the floral elements. There is no evidence of simplification or exaggeration typical of chibi art, so it can be concluded that the hair has not been integrated into a chibi-style headpiece.",

      "question": "Have the earrings been transformed into small, golden, chibi-style charms that retain the original lace-like pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The earrings in Image B remain consistent with their appearance in Image A, featuring intricate gold designs that resemble lace. They do not exhibit characteristics of chibi-style charms, such as exaggerated size or simplified forms. Thus, based on the visual analysis and comparison with the original, the earrings have not been transformed into chibi-style charms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the miniature golden chibi-style earrings visibly attached to the headpiece?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no indication in Image B that the earrings are attached to the headpiece. The earrings are clearly visible as separate accessories hanging from the ears, maintaining their original position and design. Comparing this with Image A, there is no transformation or attachment to the headpiece in a chibi style.",
