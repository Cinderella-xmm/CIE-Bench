        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses flat colors for the character and background without any visible gradients or complex patterns. The shading is minimal, adhering closely to a flat design aesthetic. This observation is based on analyzing the uniformity of color application throughout the image.",
