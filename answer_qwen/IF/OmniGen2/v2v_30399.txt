    "Question": "Q1: Have the giraffes' necks been exaggeratedly elongated in a whimsical caricature style?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffes' necks appear to be longer and more slender than what would typically be seen in a realistic depiction. This exaggeration is characteristic of a caricature style, where features are often stretched or amplified for visual effect. The necks seem disproportionately long compared to the rest of their bodies, which aligns with common practices in whimsical illustrations.",
