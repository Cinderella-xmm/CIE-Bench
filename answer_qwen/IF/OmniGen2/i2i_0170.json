      "question": "Are the overall lines and contours of the image now clear and well-defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines of the figures, mannequins, bags, and even the text 'VOGUE' are sharp and distinct. The edges appear clean without any blurring or softness, indicating that the lines and contours have been intentionally made clear and well-defined. This is typical in high-end illustrations where clarity is a priority.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the original textures been replaced with soft gradient blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a significant change in texture. The surfaces of the clothing, bags, and background exhibit smooth gradients rather than detailed textures. For instance, the jeans and jackets lack fabric detail, suggesting that the original textures have indeed been replaced with soft gradient blocks for a more stylized look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image now exhibit characteristics of a high-end commercial illustration (e.g., refined and sophisticated appearance)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image has a polished and elegant aesthetic, with vibrant colors, crisp lines, and a cohesive design. The use of gradients, bold typography ('VOGUE'), and a harmonious color palette all contribute to a refined and sophisticated appearance typical of high-end commercial illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges and boundaries between elements in the image now sharply defined and crisp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, it's evident that the edges in Image B are much sharper and crisper. In Image A, there was some natural softness in the edges due to real-world lighting and materials. However, Image B has been edited to enhance these boundaries, making them stand out clearly against each other.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do areas previously filled with detailed textures now feature smooth, soft gradients instead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the clothing and accessories had visible textures like fabric weave and leather grain. In contrast, Image B replaces these details with smooth gradients. For example, the jeans and jackets no longer show fabric texture but instead display uniform color transitions, confirming the replacement of textures with gradients.",
