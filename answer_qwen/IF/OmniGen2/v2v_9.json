        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not depict a full-body creature but rather an anthropomorphized bubble tea cup with facial features.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image includes text at the bottom that reads 'MADE NAME,' which appears to be a placeholder for a made-up name for the depicted bubble tea character. This suggests that the creator intended to give the character a unique identity.",
