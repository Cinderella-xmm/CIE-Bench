      "question": "Have the couple's backs been designed as a crystal silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show that the couple's backs are no longer solid silhouettes but have been replaced with a design resembling crystals. The shapes and edges of these designs mimic the faceted structure typical of crystals, which is distinct from the smooth back shape seen in human figures. This conclusion is drawn by observing the geometric patterns and light reflections on their backs.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the design maintain the integrity of the couple's original back shape as silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal design on the couple's backs in Image B does not follow the natural contours of human backs. Instead, it introduces new shapes and angles that do not align with the expected silhouette of a person's back. Comparing this to Image A, where the couple's backs are naturally shaped, it is clear that the integrity of the original back shape has been altered.",

      "question": "Do the couple’s back silhouettes show transparency and reflective qualities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal designs on the couple's backs in Image B exhibit characteristics such as sharp edges, facets, and internal reflections, which are commonly associated with transparent and reflective materials like crystals. These features suggest that the design intends to simulate the appearance of transparency and reflectivity, unlike the opaque nature of the couple's backs in Image A.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the surrounding environment (bench, tree, grass) unchanged except for the edited couple’s backs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing Image B with Image A, it is evident that elements such as the bench, tree, and grass remain consistent in both images. There are no noticeable changes to these environmental elements, indicating that the editing was focused solely on the couple's backs.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall design, featuring the crystal silhouettes of the couple, align with the aesthetic suitable for Valentine's Day gifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The use of crystal-like designs can be associated with themes of love and romance due to their sparkling and precious nature, often linked to jewelry and decorative items given during special occasions like Valentine's Day. The heart-shaped arrangement of the crystals further reinforces this romantic theme, making the design aesthetically fitting for Valentine's Day gifts.",
