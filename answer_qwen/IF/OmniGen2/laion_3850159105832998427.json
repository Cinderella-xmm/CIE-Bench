        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the guitar retains its original shape and material appearance, showing no signs of transformation into a dragon's torso.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The guitar neck in Image B remains unchanged in its form and function. It still appears as a standard guitar neck with frets and strings, without any indication of being reshaped into a dragon neck. The analysis is based on the visible continuity of the neck's design and its connection to the headstock, which aligns with typical guitar construction.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tuning pegs on the headstock in Image B appear to be the same as those typically found on a guitar, with no evidence of being replaced by golden, horn-like spikes.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no visible luminescent runes on the fretboard of the guitar in Image B. The fretboard maintains a standard appearance with metal frets and position markers, which are typical for guitars. The absence of any glowing or unusual markings supports this observation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The guitar strings in Image B remain as conventional metal strings, showing no transformation into fiery, flame-like tendrils. The strings maintain their linear and metallic appearance, connecting the bridge to the nut as expected in a regular guitar setup. This conclusion is derived from the clear visibility of the strings' texture and path.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cutaway horns of the guitar have indeed been transformed into majestic wings. These wings feature intricate, scale-like patterns with vibrant orange and black colors, resembling dragon wings. This transformation is evident through the detailed design and positioning of the wings extending from the guitar body, which contrasts with the standard guitar cutaways seen in Image A.",
