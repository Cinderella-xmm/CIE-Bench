      "question": "Is the entire elephant and savannah scene enclosed within a visible vintage travel case structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show an elephant and a savannah scene that are clearly contained within the boundaries of a vintage travel case. The edges of the case, including its handle and latches, are visible around the scene, indicating that the entire setup is enclosed within this structure. This conclusion is drawn from observing the physical containment and the structural elements of the case.",

      "question": "Do the elephant and landscape elements appear as detailed miniature 3D models with realistic scaling and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant and landscape elements appear to be miniature representations with a high level of detail, suggesting they are 3D models. The scaling relative to the travel case and the depth perception created by the positioning of the objects give a realistic impression despite their small size. This analysis is based on the observation of the proportions and textures which mimic real-life elements but fit within a confined space.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ground covered with a material that resembles grass but has a textured, resin-like finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ground in Image B has a texture that resembles grass but appears to have a more uniform and possibly synthetic finish, typical of resin or similar materials used in dioramas. This is inferred from the smoothness and consistency of the surface, which contrasts with natural grass's irregularities. The material choice is likely for durability and ease of maintenance in a miniature setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a small-scale acacia tree placed in the diorama to indicate scale balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a small-scale acacia tree placed within the diorama, which serves as a reference point for scale and adds to the realism of the savannah scene. The presence of this tree helps balance the composition and provides context for the environment depicted. This conclusion is based on recognizing the characteristic shape and placement of the tree within the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky depicted as painted elements on the inner surface of a backdrop lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds in Image B are painted on the inner surface of the backdrop lid of the travel case. This is evident from the flat appearance and the way they align with the lid's edge, creating a two-dimensional effect that contrasts with the three-dimensional elements below. This artistic technique is commonly used in dioramas to simulate a sky background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a brass-colored compass placed on the base of the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A brass-colored compass is visible on the base of the diorama in Image B. Its placement and color stand out against the green background, and its design is consistent with traditional compasses, adding a thematic element to the scene. This detail enhances the exploratory theme of the diorama.",
