        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite in Image B has a simple geometric shape with clean lines and a flat appearance, which are characteristics commonly associated with paper crafts. The tail is also depicted in a way that suggests it could be made from strips of paper. Additionally, the other kites in the image have designs that resemble cut-out shapes, further supporting the idea that these kites could be crafted from paper.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central kite is indeed prominent due to its size and color contrast against the blue sky. However, there are additional kites and clouds in the background, which, while not overly distracting, do add some complexity to the scene. Nonetheless, the central kite remains the focal point.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the structural details of the kite, such as its frame and tail, well-defined and clear enough to suggest it could be crafted from paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite in Image B has clearly defined edges and a visible frame structure, along with a distinct tail. These features are rendered in a way that mimics the look of a paper craft, where each part is sharply outlined and appears flat, suggesting that the kite could indeed be a paper model.",
