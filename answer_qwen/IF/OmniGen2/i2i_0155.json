      "question": "Is the text \"Breathe\" added at the top left corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word \"Breathe\" is clearly visible in the upper left area of the image. The placement and orientation suggest it is intentionally positioned there to draw attention while complementing the overall theme. This conclusion is drawn from observing the text's location relative to other elements in the image.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Calm\" placed at the bottom right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word \"Calm\" is located towards the lower right side of Image B. Its position aligns with the description of being in the bottom right corner, which helps balance the composition and reinforces the intended message alongside the plant imagery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the text \"Breathe\" and \"Calm\" use fonts, colors, and sizes suitable for a plant therapy and meditation theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fonts used for \"Breathe\" and \"Calm\" are simple and clean, which align well with themes of tranquility and mindfulness. The black color provides good contrast against the lighter background, ensuring readability without being intrusive. The size is appropriate as it does not overpower the visual focus on the plant, making it suitable for a plant therapy and meditation theme.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the added texts \"Breathe\" and \"Calm\" blend well with the plant and window setting, maintaining the calming atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texts \"Breathe\" and \"Calm\" are minimalistic in design and strategically placed to avoid disrupting the natural aesthetic of the plant and its serene environment. They enhance the calming effect by reinforcing the meditative qualities associated with plants and nature, thus blending well with the overall setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the texts \"Breathe\" and \"Calm\" positioned in a way that does not obscure the central visual elements of the plant and window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both texts are placed at the periphery of the image, with \"Breathe\" at the top left and \"Calm\" at the bottom right. This positioning ensures that they do not cover or interfere with the main visual elements—the plant and the window—allowing these elements to remain the focal points of the image.",
