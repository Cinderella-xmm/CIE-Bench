      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical or dome-shaped structure resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B clearly show that the entire scene is enclosed within a transparent spherical structure. This is evident from the curved edges of the glass and the way it refracts light, which are typical characteristics of a snow globe. The scene inside appears to be a miniature model, further supporting this conclusion.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper tier does not display a detailed Paris skyline composed of buildings with metallic textures or finishes. Instead, it shows a clear blue sky with some clouds. There are no visible buildings or structures that resemble a skyline.",

      "question": "Does the lower tier contain dense, vibrant green vegetation including trees, hedges, and garden elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains dense, vibrant green vegetation including trees, hedges, and garden elements at the lower tier. This is evident from the neatly trimmed hedges and trees lining the pathways, which are characteristic of a well-maintained garden setting.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no visible silvery or white flake-like particles floating between the upper and lower tiers in Image B. The scene inside the snow globe is clear, without any such particles present.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the scene in Image B does not feature sculpted cobblestone patterns and classic street lamps. Instead, it has a smooth, flat surface with a decorative border and small lights, which are more indicative of a snow globe's base design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are exactly two Eiffel Towers visible in the scene. This can be clearly observed as the towers are prominent features within the snow globe, standing side by side.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B exhibits characteristics of a miniature 3D model, such as exaggerated perspective, reduced scale, and model-like textures. The overall appearance suggests a carefully crafted miniature representation, fitting within the confines of a snow globe.",
