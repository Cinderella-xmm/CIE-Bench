      "question": "Has the giraffe been turned into an adorable collection of Russian nesting dolls with a chibi giraffe theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show a set of colorful, cartoonish nesting dolls. The largest doll has a giraffe head on top, which is stylized in a cute and simplified manner consistent with chibi art style. This suggests that the giraffe from Image A has indeed been transformed into a chibi-themed Russian nesting doll. The analysis combines the observation of the giraffe head's design with common knowledge about chibi art and nesting dolls.",

      "question": "Are there exactly five nesting dolls arranged in descending sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a set of five nesting dolls placed side by side. Each doll is progressively smaller than the one to its left, indicating a descending size order. This conclusion is drawn directly from counting the number of dolls and observing their relative sizes.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls arranged neatly on a classy wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface beneath the nesting dolls in Image B appears to be a polished wooden table with visible wood grain patterns, suggesting a high-quality or 'classy' appearance. The dolls are aligned in a neat row, further supporting the idea of a tidy arrangement. This analysis is based on the visual texture and pattern of the surface as well as the orderly placement of the dolls.",

      "question": "Does the edited image have a 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the aspect ratio, one would typically measure the width and height of the image. However, without specific measurements provided, it's not possible to definitively confirm the exact aspect ratio just by visual inspection. Therefore, this question cannot be conclusively answered based solely on the visual information available.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls maintain a chibi style with large heads, small bodies, and simplified features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B exhibit characteristics typical of chibi art, such as disproportionately large heads, small bodies, and simple facial features like large eyes and minimalistic expressions. These elements are visually evident and align with common knowledge about chibi-style illustrations.",
