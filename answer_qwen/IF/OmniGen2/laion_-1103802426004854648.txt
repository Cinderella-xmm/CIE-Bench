    "Question": "Q1: Is the seahorse made entirely of glass material instead of plush fabric?",
    "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show a soft texture on the body of the seahorse, which is characteristic of plush fabric rather than glass. The surface appears fuzzy and lacks the smoothness and transparency typically associated with glass materials. Additionally, the way light interacts with the surface suggests it absorbs light like fabric rather than reflecting it like glass.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the body of the seahorse have a translucent pink glass appearance with visible subtle bubble textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the seahorse does not exhibit any translucency or bubble textures that would be indicative of glass. Instead, it has a consistent pink color with a matte finish typical of plush toys. There are no signs of light passing through or refracting within the material as would occur with glass.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the belly section made of opaque yellow glass with an etched music note design?",
    "explanation": "The belly section in Image B is clearly made of a plastic-like material, not glass. It is opaque and has a smooth surface with a printed music note design inside a heart shape. Glass would likely have a different texture and reflective properties, which are not present here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ribbons on the head and fins made of lavender-colored glass instead of fabric?",
    "explanation": "The ribbons on the seahorse in Image B appear to be made of fabric due to their soft texture and the way they drape over the seahorse's body. They lack the rigidity and reflective qualities that would suggest they are made of glass. The color and sheen are consistent with fabric ribbons commonly used in plush toys.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the seahorse placed on a reflective black display stand?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse is indeed positioned on a black object that resembles a display stand. The surface of this object is glossy and reflects light, indicating it is designed to be reflective. This supports the conclusion that it is a reflective black display stand.",
    "answer": "Yes"
