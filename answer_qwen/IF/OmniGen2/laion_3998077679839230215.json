      "question": "Are there exactly six separate chibi-style illustrations, each depicting one of the specified elements (blouse, lehenga, dupatta, jewelry, bangles, background)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains six distinct circular illustrations, each with a chibi-style depiction of a woman wearing traditional attire. Each illustration focuses on different elements such as clothing and accessories. By analyzing the visual cues, it is clear that these elements include the blouse, lehenga, dupatta, jewelry, bangles, and background. The analysis does not require comparison with Image A at this stage.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do all six magnets exhibit a vibrant, glossy surface with visible reflections or shine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each of the six magnets in Image B appears to have a glossy surface indicated by the bright colors and subtle reflections around the edges and within the designs. This suggests a polished finish typical of collectible items. There is no need to compare with Image A for this observation.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all six magnets have clearly rounded edges instead of sharp corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of all six magnets in Image B are rounded, as seen from their circular shapes. Rounded edges are common in physical magnets to prevent sharpness and enhance safety and aesthetic appeal. No comparison with Image A is necessary here.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does each of the six magnets accurately depict one of the following: the embellished purple blouse, the intricate lehenga with floral patterns, the red dupatta, the traditional jewelry, the silver bangles, or the ornate background wall pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each magnet in Image B depicts specific elements: the purple blouse with embellishments, the floral-patterned lehenga, the red dupatta, traditional jewelry including earrings and necklaces, silver bangles, and an ornate background wall pattern. These details align with the specified elements without needing to refer to Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all six magnets rendered in a chibi art style, featuring exaggerated proportions such as large heads and simplified facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All six magnets in Image B are rendered in a chibi art style, characterized by large heads, simplified facial features, and exaggerated proportions. This style is evident through the consistent design across all magnets. Comparing with Image A is unnecessary for this conclusion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the six magnets displayed as individual, standalone items arranged in a way that suggests they are part of a collectible set, rather than a single composite image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The six magnets in Image B are displayed individually with space between them, suggesting they are part of a set rather than a single composite image. Their arrangement implies they could be collected separately. This observation does not require a comparison with Image A.",
