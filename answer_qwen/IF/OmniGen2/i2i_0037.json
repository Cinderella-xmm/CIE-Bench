      "question": "Does the image have a white border frame surrounding it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly shows a white border frame surrounding the photograph of the dessert. This is evident as there is a distinct white space around the edges of the photo, which is characteristic of a Polaroid-style image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of the image, there is text that reads 'Banana Cream 2024'. However, the text appears to be typed rather than handwritten. The font and uniformity suggest it was added digitally rather than written by hand.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image has a light brown tint over the entire scene, which gives it a vintage appearance similar to old film photographs. This effect is commonly used in editing to create a nostalgic or retro feel.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The combination of the white border frame and the light brown vintage filter mimics the style of a Polaroid photograph. These elements together contribute to the overall Polaroid aesthetic.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing with Image A, the dessert itself appears unchanged in terms of its visual details such as color, texture, and arrangement. The only differences are the addition of the white border frame, the caption at the bottom, and the vintage filter, which do not alter the original appearance of the dessert.",
