      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera lens has been edited to resemble a wide, expressive eye with an iris and pupil. This is evident from the circular shape of the lens now having colors and patterns that mimic an eye, including a white sclera and a colored iris. The transformation is clear through visual cues such as the added details that are not typical for a camera lens.",
