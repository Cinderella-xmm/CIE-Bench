      "question": "Does the image exhibit characteristics of Japanese woodblock art, including flat colors, strong outlines, and stylized natural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image exhibits characteristics reminiscent of Japanese woodblock art. The colors are flat and uniform, lacking the gradients typically seen in more realistic depictions. Strong outlines define the shapes and figures, which is a hallmark of woodblock prints. The natural elements, such as the trees and pond, are stylized rather than detailed, further aligning with this art style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background includes trees and a pond, but they are not intricately detailed. Instead, they are simplified and stylized, with the pond reflecting the sky and trees in a basic manner.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title 'The Duck Chessmaster's Wisdom' is indeed written in a stylized font that could be described as elegant calligraphy. However, it is located at the top of the image rather than the lower right corner. Therefore, while the description of the calligraphy is accurate, its placement does not match the given statement.",
