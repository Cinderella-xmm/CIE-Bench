      "question": "Is the background of the image now a weathered pirate map with aged parchment texture and sepia-toned colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B clearly displays a weathered pirate map with an aged parchment texture and sepia-toned colors. This is evident from the yellowish-brown hue, the grid lines resembling latitude and longitude on a map, and the overall vintage appearance. The visual cues combined with common knowledge about pirate maps confirm this analysis.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the treasure chest is indeed depicted as a central element using a detailed ink sketch style.

      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a legend with symbols for coins, gems, and pottery labeled in bold, ancient-style typography.
