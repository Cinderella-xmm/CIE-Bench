    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The motorcycle in Image B is not a collectible-style figure with simplified or stylized proportions. It maintains realistic proportions and details, consistent with a real motorcycle rather than a toy or model. The analysis is based on the visual cues of the motorcycle's size, complexity, and design, which align with a full-sized vehicle rather than a miniature collectible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The box containing the collectible figure does not appear to be rendered in isometric projection. Isometric projection would show three sides of the box at 120-degree angles, but the box is shown from a frontal perspective with only two sides visible. This conclusion is drawn from observing the orientation and angles of the box in the image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The motorcycle in Image B does not feature glowing neon accents, hover wheels, or a visible digital interface. The motorcycle appears as a standard, non-futuristic model with no such enhancements. This assessment is based on the absence of any glowing elements, wheels that suggest hovering capability, or interfaces that are typically associated with futuristic designs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The text 'FUTURE RIDER' is clearly visible on the box in Image B, and it is correctly spelled. The text is legible and positioned prominently on the side of the box, making it easy to read and confirm its spelling. This conclusion is reached by directly observing the text on the box.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "There is a transparent section on the box that reveals the collectible figure inside. This can be inferred from the clear depiction of the figure through what appears to be a window or transparent panel on the box. The transparency allows for a view of the figure within, which is a common feature in packaging for collectibles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:",
    "explanation": "There is no second depiction of the motorcycle next to the box that displays ultra-realistic textures and metallic finishes. The image shows only one motorcycle and two boxes with collectible figures. There is no additional motorcycle depicted with the described characteristics. This conclusion is based on a thorough examination of all objects present in the image.",
    "answer": "No"
