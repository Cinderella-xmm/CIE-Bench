      "question": "Does the edited image include a top-down view of the sink structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image consists of four distinct illustrations of sinks, each showing different perspectives. None of these illustrations provide a top-down view; instead, they show front-facing views from various angles. A top-down view would require looking directly down onto the sink, which is not present here.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image include an angled side view of the sink structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image includes multiple views of the sink structures. Among them, there are illustrations that depict the sinks at an angle, allowing visibility of both the front and side aspects of the sink structure. This indicates that an angled side view is indeed included.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the top-down view and the angled side view merged into a single image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As previously established, the edited image does not contain a top-down view. Additionally, the angled side views are separate illustrations and not combined with any other perspective in a single image. Therefore, there is no merging of a top-down and angled side view.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the layout of the top-down and angled side views clear and well-organized in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the edited image lacks a top-down view, this part of the question is irrelevant. However, the angled side views are clearly separated and organized within their own sections of the image, making it easy to distinguish between the different sink designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do both the top-down view and the angled side view accurately depict the sink structure seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original image shows a detailed bathroom setup with specific features like dual sinks, mirrors, and cabinetry. The edited image only provides simplified illustrations of generic sink structures without the surrounding context or additional elements. Since there is no top-down view in the edited image and the angled side views do not match the complexity of the original image, they cannot be considered accurate depictions.",
