      "question": "Is there a visible logo placed on the handle of the hammer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer handle is clearly visible and there are no logos or markings on it. The handle appears smooth and uniform in texture and color, which suggests that there is no logo present. This conclusion is drawn by closely examining the surface of the handle for any irregularities or patterns that would indicate a logo.",

      "question": "Are there elegant, readable typographic elements displayed directly on the wood shavings scattered across the workbench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows wood shavings scattered across the workbench, but there are no typographic elements or text integrated into these shavings. Wood shavings typically do not have such features due to their natural formation during woodworking processes. Therefore, based on visual cues and common sense, there are no readable typographic elements on the wood shavings.",

      "question": "Is there a horizontal rustic textured banner positioned at the top of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, there is indeed a horizontal banner with a rustic textured appearance. It contains text and design elements that suggest branding or labeling. This observation is made by analyzing the upper portion of the image where the banner is prominently placed against the pegboard background.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pegboard in grayscale with visible copper-colored accents on tools or hardware?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pegboard in Image B is primarily grayscale, but there are noticeable copper-colored accents on some tools and hardware pieces. These accents stand out against the neutral tones of the pegboard and tools, indicating a deliberate design choice to highlight certain elements. This analysis is based on observing the color contrasts within the image.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a sleek, minimalist business card visible behind the tools on the pegboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no business card visible behind the tools on the pegboard in Image B. The tools and hardware are neatly arranged, and the space behind them does not show any additional objects like a business card. This conclusion is reached by carefully inspecting the area behind the tools for any such items.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all original tools visible and retained in their original positions on the pegboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, all original tools appear to be retained in their original positions on the pegboard. The arrangement and spacing of the tools seem consistent between the two images, suggesting that no tools have been removed or repositioned. This comparison involves noting the relative locations of each tool in both images.",
