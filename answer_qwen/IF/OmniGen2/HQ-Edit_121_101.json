      "question": "Is the image presented as a series of separate stamp-like elements arranged in a grid or collection format, each resembling a paper-cut design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The image in question is clearly structured as a series of separate elements arranged in a grid format, resembling stamps. Each element has distinct borders and content, such as illustrations of traditional Korean architecture and hanbok designs. The style mimics paper-cut art with clean lines and flat colors, which supports the description of a stamp-like design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral embroidery details on the hanbok enhanced with visible metallic foil effects (e.g., shiny, reflective highlights)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the floral embroidery details on the hanbok depicted in Image B, there are no visible metallic foil effects or shiny, reflective highlights. The design appears to be illustrated with flat colors and lacks any indication of metallic texture or shine that would suggest the use of foil.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the bow on the hanbok been visibly enlarged compared to its original size in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow on the hanbok is significantly larger compared to its typical size on a real hanbok. This enlargement is evident when considering the proportion of the bow relative to the rest of the garment. Comparing this with Image A, where the bow appears more realistically sized, confirms that the bow in Image B has been visibly enlarged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The traditional Korean architectural background is indeed visible in each of the top four sections of Image B, depicting various styles of Korean buildings. These illustrations are integrated into the overall composition as part of the stamp series, maintaining clarity and relevance to the theme of Korean culture.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The entire stamp series in Image B is displayed on a surface that resembles embossed leather. The brown background has a textured appearance with visible stitching along the edges, suggesting a leather-like material with depth and tactile qualities.",
