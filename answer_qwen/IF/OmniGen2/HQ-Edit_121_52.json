      "question": "Is the astronaut rendered in a cartoon style with simplified features, bold lines, or exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The astronaut in Image B is depicted with a style that includes simplified features, bold lines, and exaggerated proportions. The suit's details are less intricate compared to realistic depictions, and the overall appearance has a stylized, cartoonish quality. This conclusion is drawn from observing the clean lines, uniform shading, and lack of detailed textures which are typical characteristics of cartoon art.",

      "question": "Are there visible action zig-zag lines surrounding the astronaut’s limbs or body to indicate motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no visible action zig-zag lines surrounding the astronaut’s limbs or body in Image B. Action lines are typically used in comic books or cartoons to indicate motion, but this image does not employ such techniques. Instead, the astronaut's pose suggests movement without the need for additional visual cues like lines.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The astronaut’s suit in Image B features decorative celestial motifs such as stars, planets, or galaxies in blue and silver tones. These motifs are evident on the legs of the suit, adding a thematic element related to space exploration. This observation is based on the clear depiction of these elements within the context of the astronaut's attire.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moon surface beneath the astronaut in Image B is depicted in an illustrated, non-photorealistic style with simplified or graphic elements. It lacks the detailed craters and textures seen in real lunar images, instead opting for a more stylized representation that aligns with the overall cartoon aesthetic of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a space-themed border with stars and possibly other celestial elements, along with a visible textured white background resembling card stock. The border enhances the space theme while the textured background gives the impression of the image being printed on a physical medium, contributing to its overall presentation.",
