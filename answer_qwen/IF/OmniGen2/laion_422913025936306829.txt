    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "The shirt design in Image B uses a vivid and saturated color palette, including electric blue, hot pink, and yellow. These colors are characteristic of pop art, which often employs bright, eye-catching hues to create a bold visual impact. The absence of subdued or earthy tones further supports this observation. By analyzing the visual cues alone, it is clear that the design aligns with pop art aesthetics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "In Image B, the muscular figure's anatomy is defined by large, solid-colored sections rather than fine shading or gradient effects. The chest, arms, and legs are delineated using blocks of color, which is a common technique in pop art to emphasize form and structure. This approach contrasts with more traditional artistic methods that might use subtle shading or gradients.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "The edges of the figure and surrounding elements in Image B are composed of crisp, angular lines. These lines contribute to the sharpness and clarity of the design, typical of pop art styles that favor geometric precision over organic flow. The lack of flowing curves enhances the energetic and dynamic feel of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:"
    "explanation": "Comparing the two images, Image A features patterns in gold tones that are relatively subtle. In contrast, Image B transforms these patterns into bright, glowing neon colors like electric blue and hot pink. This change significantly alters the visual impact, making the patterns more prominent and vibrant, consistent with pop art characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:"
    "explanation": "Image B includes recurring stylized patterns such as waves and dots that are repeated across the shirt in an energetic manner. These patterns add to the overall dynamism and rhythm of the design, enhancing its pop art aesthetic. The consistency and repetition of these elements create a cohesive and visually engaging composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:"
    "explanation": "Despite the stylistic transformation, the central figure in Image B remains clearly identifiable as a muscular male figure in a dynamic pose. The arms are raised, and the body is angled, maintaining the original posture. The pop art style does not obscure the figure's identity but instead accentuates its form through bold colors and lines.",
    "answer": "Yes"
