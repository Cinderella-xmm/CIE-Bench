      "question": "Does the scene appear as a digitally rendered holographic installation with visible projection-like effects such as transparency, layering, or digital glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B exhibits characteristics of a digitally rendered holographic installation. The trees have glowing, iridescent filaments that resemble fiber optics, and the overall lighting has a digital glow effect. There is also a central light column that appears to be a projection or hologram, contributing to the impression of transparency and layering. These elements suggest a high-tech, virtualized environment rather than a natural one.",

      "question": "Are the waterfalls depicted as animated light projections on transparent or reflective glass surfaces instead of natural flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no waterfalls depicted as animated light projections on transparent or reflective glass surfaces. Instead, the image features trees with glowing filaments and a central light column, but no water elements are present. Therefore, based on the visual cues in Image B alone, it can be concluded that there are no such waterfalls.",

      "question": "Do the trees feature visible iridescent, glowing filaments resembling fiber optics embedded within their trunks and branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B clearly feature visible iridescent, glowing filaments that resemble fiber optics embedded within their trunks and branches. This is evident from the vibrant, multicolored light trails running along the contours of the trees, which is not a natural occurrence but rather an artistic representation suggesting advanced technology or digital artistry.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the vines appear as virtualized, looping structures with light trails or animated effects, forming a kinetic light sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vines in Image B do not appear as virtualized, looping structures with light trails or animated effects forming a kinetic light sculpture. The focus is on the trees with glowing filaments, and there are no prominent vine structures that exhibit such characteristics. Thus, based on the visual information provided in Image B, this description does not apply.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the environment integrated with futuristic architectural elements such as glass panels, geometric structures, or artificial lighting that blend with the natural forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B integrates futuristic architectural elements such as the central light column, which resembles artificial lighting and could be part of a geometric structure. The environment blends these elements with the natural forms of the trees, creating a harmonious yet distinctly technological atmosphere. This combination suggests a deliberate integration of nature and futuristic design.",
