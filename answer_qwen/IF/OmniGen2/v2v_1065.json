      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The individual in Image B is depicted as a small, stylized 3D figure with exaggerated proportions typical of chibi art.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is shown mid-air above a skateboard, which suggests they are performing a trick. The positioning of the legs and arms indicates dynamic movement, consistent with skateboarding tricks. The presence of the skateboard further supports this conclusion.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B is placed on what appears to be a table near a window. Through the window, a blurred background resembling a skate park can be seen, suggesting an outdoor setting beyond the indoor placement of the snow globe.",
