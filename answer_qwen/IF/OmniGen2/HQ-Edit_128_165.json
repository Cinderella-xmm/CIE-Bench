      "question": "Has the ornate lantern been fully transformed into a jellyfish shape, with a bell-shaped body and flowing appendages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has a distinct bell-shaped top that resembles the head of a jellyfish, along with flowing appendages that mimic the tentacles of a jellyfish. The overall structure no longer resembles a traditional lantern but instead aligns with the visual characteristics of a jellyfish. This conclusion is drawn from observing the smooth, rounded top and the long, wavy tendrils extending downward.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the metal framing elements been replaced with iridescent, ribbon-like tendrils extending from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original metal framing in Image A has been replaced by soft, flowing tendrils in Image B. These tendrils exhibit an iridescent quality, changing colors smoothly and giving the appearance of ribbon-like structures. This transformation is evident when comparing the rigid, geometric lines of the lantern's frame to the fluid, organic forms in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the glass panels been transformed into a translucent, bell-shaped body that appears soft and fluid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bell-shaped body that is translucent and has a soft, fluid appearance, which is a significant departure from the solid, segmented glass panels seen in Image A. The transformation suggests a change from a hard, structured material to one that is more ethereal and organic, consistent with the properties of a jellyfish.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original patterns replaced with glowing, swirling, organic bioluminescent designs within the jellyfish's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The intricate patterns on the lantern in Image A have been replaced with glowing, swirling designs in Image B. These new designs are organic and bioluminescent in appearance, fitting the theme of a jellyfish. The comparison highlights a shift from static, decorative patterns to dynamic, light-emitting ones.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there glowing, star-like nodules visible along the length of the iridescent tendrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tendrils feature small, glowing points that resemble star-like nodules. These are not present in Image A, where the lantern's design is more uniform and lacks such details. The addition of these nodules enhances the impression of a living, bioluminescent creature.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the jellyfish depicted floating in an underwater environment with ambient lighting, soft diffusion, and visual elements suggesting water (e.g., particles, light rays, depth)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts an underwater setting with ambient lighting and soft diffusion effects. There are visual cues like light rays and particles that suggest the presence of water. This contrasts with Image A, which is set against a plain wall and wooden beams, indicating an indoor environment. The transformation effectively places the jellyfish in a marine context.",
