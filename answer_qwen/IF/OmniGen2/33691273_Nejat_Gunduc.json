      "question": "Is the man depicted wearing a trench coat and a fedora-style hat consistent with a noir detective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The man in Image B is wearing a hat that resembles a fedora and a jacket that could be interpreted as a trench coat, both of which are iconic elements associated with noir detectives. The style of the clothing and the overall aesthetic align with the typical depiction of a detective in noir films or comics. The visual cues such as the hat's shape and the jacket's design support this conclusion.",

      "question": "Is the man in a contemplative pose, such as looking away thoughtfully or touching his face/chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted touching his ear, which can be seen as a contemplative pose. This gesture often signifies deep thought or listening intently, common in scenes where a character is pondering or investigating something. The positioning of his hand near his face reinforces the idea of contemplation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the background feature an eerie urban environment with elements such as dark alleys, wet pavement, or dim lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature an eerie urban environment with dark alleys, wet pavement, or dim lighting. Instead, it shows a stylized background that includes buildings but lacks the specific atmospheric elements typically associated with a noir setting. The background is more illustrative and less detailed compared to what one might expect from a classic noir scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Coca-Cola Noir' is clearly visible in Image B, written in a font that has a vintage style reminiscent of old advertisements or comic book titles. This type of font choice is consistent with the noir theme and adds to the overall aesthetic of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are thought bubbles present near the man’s head in Image B. These bubbles contain text that appears to be related to the mystery of the scene, although the text itself is not clear or legible. The presence of these bubbles suggests internal monologue or thoughts, which is a common element in comic strips and noir narratives.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is rendered in monochrome and styled like a comic strip. It features clear panel borders and stylized line work, which are characteristic of comic art. The black-and-white color scheme and the way the lines define the characters and objects further emphasize this comic strip style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is a clear visual juxtaposition between the noir detective and the stylized advertisement figure in Image B. The detective's attire and pose contrast sharply with the modern, clean lines and bright appearance of the advertisement figure. This contrast enhances the surreal theme by blending different visual styles and contexts within the same frame.",
