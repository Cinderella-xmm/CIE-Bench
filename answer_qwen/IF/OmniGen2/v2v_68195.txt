    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Nebraska Huskers lettering appears in a standard font with no visible resemblance to dried corn husks or golden wheat. The text is clear and stylized but does not incorporate any organic shapes or textures that would suggest such elements. Therefore, based on visual analysis and common sense, the lettering has not been reshaped.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "Image B shows delicate embroidered motifs of miniature corn cobs and autumn leaves around the hemline of the dress, not the gathered waistline. These motifs are clearly visible and add a thematic detail related to Nebraska's agricultural heritage. Thus, while there are such motifs, they are not located where the question suggests.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "The red fabric in Image B appears vibrant and consistent with a rich crimson hue. Comparing it to Image A, the color seems deeper and more saturated, suggesting an enhancement in the editing process.

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:"

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
