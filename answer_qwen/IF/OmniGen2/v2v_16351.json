        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features wooden paneling, a sleek console table with decorative items, and a modern lamp, which are characteristic of an elegant showroom. The absence of lockers and sports-related paraphernalia further supports this conclusion. By combining these visual cues with world knowledge about mid-century modern design and showroom aesthetics, it is clear that the setting has been changed from a locker room to a showroom.",

      "question": "Has the jersey display been replaced with a luxurious piece of designer furniture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jersey in Image B is displayed on a mannequin rather than hanging on a hook as in a typical locker room. However, there is no luxurious piece of designer furniture replacing the jersey display. Instead, the jersey remains a prominent feature in the new setting. Therefore, based on the visual information and common sense about furniture and jersey displays, the answer is no.",

      "question": "Have the characters' positions and expressions remained unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character previously seen in a suit appears as a mannequin giving a thumbs-up gesture, which is a significant change in position and expression compared to Image A where he was gesturing with his hands open. This indicates that the characters' positions and expressions have not remained unchanged. Comparing both images using visual cues and understanding of human gestures confirms this.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases clean lines in the furniture and decor, organic shapes in the lamp and vase, and a mix of materials such as wood, metal, and fabric. These elements align with the characteristics of mid-century modern design.
