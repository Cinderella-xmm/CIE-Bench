      "question": "Is the stave church enclosed within a transparent glass display case with visible structural framing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stave church is clearly visible within a transparent glass display case. The edges of the glass and the structural framing are evident, as they form a rectangular enclosure around the church. This conclusion is drawn from observing the straight lines and corners that define the boundaries of the glass case, which are consistent with typical display case designs used for protecting and showcasing objects.",

      "question": "Are there multiple layers of soft, wispy clouds visible in the background panel behind the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background panel behind the display case in Image B shows a sky with soft, wispy clouds. These clouds appear layered and have a light, airy texture, which is characteristic of high-altitude cirrus clouds often seen in serene mountain landscapes. The presence of these clouds adds depth to the scene and suggests a calm, open atmosphere.",

      "question": "Are small-scale coniferous trees positioned around the base of the glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Around the base of the glass display case in Image B, there are small-scale coniferous trees positioned strategically. These trees are proportionally smaller compared to the church, indicating they are part of the miniature landscape design within the display case. Their placement mimics a natural forest setting, enhancing the realism of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the mountains in the background feature a desaturated, low-contrast color palette consistent with a muted tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mountains in the background of Image B feature a desaturated, low-contrast color palette. This muted tone is typical for distant mountain ranges, where atmospheric perspective causes colors to become less vibrant and more subdued. The lack of sharp contrasts and vivid colors supports this observation, creating a sense of depth and distance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the base of the glass display case in Image B, there is sculpted rocky terrain forming a border. These rocks vary in size and shape, contributing to a naturalistic appearance that complements the miniature landscape. They are carefully arranged to simulate a rugged, uneven ground surface, adding to the overall realism of the scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the glass display case in Image B, there appears to be a simulated snowy path leading up to the entrance of the stave church. The path has faint imprints that resemble footprints, suggesting prior movement across the snow. These details enhance the narrative of the scene, implying human activity within this miniature world.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stave church in Image B retains its original architectural details, including carved wooden elements, multiple gables, and dragon-shaped roof ornaments. These features are meticulously crafted and closely resemble traditional stave church designs. The preservation of such intricate details indicates a high level of craftsmanship in the miniature model.",
