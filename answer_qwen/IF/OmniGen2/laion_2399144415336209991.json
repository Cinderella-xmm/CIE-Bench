      "question": "Is the couple depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated facial features and proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B are clearly depicted with exaggerated and stylized features typical of cartoon illustrations. Their faces have large eyes, small noses, and wide smiles, which are common exaggerations in cartoons to convey emotion vividly. The proportions of their heads relative to their bodies also appear larger than realistic human proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the beadwork on the bride’s gown been enhanced to appear more elaborate or exaggerated than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bride's gown does not show detailed beadwork as it is a cartoon illustration. Cartoon styles often simplify textures and details for clarity and visual appeal. Comparing this to Image A, where the beadwork is visible and intricate, it can be concluded that the beadwork has been simplified rather than enhanced in Image B.",

      "question": "Has the groom’s suit lapel been enlarged to an exaggerated size compared to its original proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The groom’s suit lapel in Image B appears proportionate to the rest of his attire within the context of the cartoon style. There is no indication of an exaggerated size compared to standard proportions seen in similar cartoon depictions. Therefore, there is no evidence suggesting the lapel has been enlarged disproportionately.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two couples holding champagne glasses in a toasting pose. There are no scenes depicting the couple holding hands or dancing. Thus, only one scene is present, not three distinct ones as described in the question.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image contains a single heart-shaped border with a gold trim enclosing the depiction of the two couples toasting. This matches the description provided in the question regarding the heart-shaped border and gold trim.",
