{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a background that has been changed to a rich, dark velvet curtain. This is evident from the deep red color and the texture that resembles fabric folds, which contrasts sharply with the green gradient background in Image A. The change aligns with common practices in graphic design where backgrounds are altered to evoke different moods or themes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The 'Sumo Digital' logo in Image B is not rendered as an embossed seal on a wooden plaque beneath the 'Rising Star' logo. Instead, it appears as part of the logo set alongside other elements. Comparing this with Image A, where the 'Sumo Digital' logo is similarly placed, there's no indication of a wooden plaque or embossing effect in either image.",
