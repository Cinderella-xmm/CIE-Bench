    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the boot transformed into a sculpture-like object with a rigid, stylized structure consistent with Art Deco aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boot in Image B maintains its original shape and proportions as a functional footwear item. There are no signs of a rigid, stylized structure or architectural elements typical of Art Deco design. The boot retains its flexibility and organic form, which is inconsistent with the characteristics of a sculpture-like object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the embroidered floral patterns replaced with geometric designs such as zigzags, chevrons, or sunburst motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative patterns on the boot still resemble floral designs rather than geometric shapes like zigzags or chevrons. The patterns maintain their organic flow and do not exhibit the sharp lines or repetitive symmetry associated with geometric designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the decorative elements on the boot have a metallic sheen and appear as inlaid metal plates or strips rather than stitched leather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decorative elements on the boot in Image B show a metallic sheen, suggesting a material change from stitched leather to something resembling polished metal. This gives the impression that the patterns could be inlaid metal plates or strips rather than traditional stitching.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the heel been redesigned into a stepped, multi-tiered architectural shape with sharp angles and vertical emphasis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The heel of the boot in Image B remains a simple block heel without any stepped or tiered design. It does not exhibit sharp angles or vertical emphasis that would align with an architectural redesign. The heel appears consistent with standard boot construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the boot surface exhibit a hard, reflective, non-leather-like finish consistent with metal or polished stone, indicating a sculptural material change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the boot in Image B has a highly reflective and smooth appearance, which is not characteristic of leather. This suggests a material change to something akin to polished metal or stone, giving it a sculptural quality.",
