      "question": "Has the Sphinx’s head been replaced with a radiant sun disc featuring visible hieroglyphic patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no Sphinx present. Instead, the image features a golden figure with wings and a sun disc behind its head. The sun disc does have intricate patterns that resemble hieroglyphics. Therefore, it's clear that this question pertains to an analysis of Image A, which is not provided here. Based on Image B alone, the answer cannot be determined.",

      "question": "Are there shimmering golden wings extending from both sides of the Sphinx’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a golden figure with large, detailed wings extending from its back. These wings are indeed shimmering and golden in appearance. Since there is no Sphinx in Image B, the wings cannot be associated with the Sphinx. This indicates that the wings belong to the golden figure depicted in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the limbs of the Sphinx show flowing desert sands cascading downward from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a Sphinx at all; instead, it shows a golden winged figure standing on sand dunes. There are no limbs of a Sphinx or any indication of flowing desert sands cascading from such limbs. The sands in the image are part of the background and do not flow from any specific figure.",

      "question": "Are there ankhs glowing in azure color located on the paws of the Sphinx?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no Sphinx present, so there are no paws to examine for ankhs. The golden figure holds two blue objects resembling ankhs, but they are not located on paws. Thus, based on the content of Image B, there are no ankhs on the paws of a Sphinx.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the Sphinx still positioned in the same location relative to the background elements (such as the pyramid and sunset), with the sun disc correctly placed where the head was?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a Sphinx or a sun disc replacing a Sphinx's head. It features a golden winged figure with a sun disc behind its head, set against a desert backdrop with a setting sun. Comparing this to Image A would require Image A's content, which is not available. Based solely on Image B, the question is not applicable.",
