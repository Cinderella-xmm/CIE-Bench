    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The pelican in Image B is clearly rendered with a cartoon-style aesthetic. The features are simplified and exaggerated, such as the large eyes, bright colors, and the addition of a sailor hat. This style is typical for cartoons, which often use such elements to create a playful and appealing character.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's beak appears larger and more vibrant in color compared to what would typically be seen in a realistic depiction. The exaggerated size and shape contribute to the cartoonish nature of the image. Comparing this with Image A, where the beak is proportionate and naturalistic, it is evident that the beak in Image B has been visibly exaggerated.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The pelican’s eyes in Image B are noticeably bulging and enlarged, which is a common technique in cartoons to add expressiveness and appeal. This contrasts with Image A, where the eyes are smaller and more realistically proportioned. The enlargement here serves a comedic and engaging effect typical of cartoon art.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The feathers in Image B are colored in vivid pastel shades, predominantly soft blues.

In contrast, Image A shows naturalistic feather colors.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "While the colors of the feathers have changed in Image B, the texture still resembles the detailed feather patterns seen in Image A. The preservation of texture details even with color changes suggests an effort to maintain some realism within the cartoon style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:",
    "explanation": "Image B includes a sailor hat on the pelican’s head, which is not present in Image A. The hat adds to the whimsical and nautical theme of the cartoon rendering. Its presence is a clear indicator of an edited or stylized version of the original.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7:",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B has been changed from grass in Image A to a muted wooden plank surface. This change supports the nautical theme introduced by the sailor hat and contributes to the overall whimsical aesthetic of the cartoon.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8:",
    "explanation": "The combination of the sailor hat, the cartoon-style rendering, and the wooden background creates a nautical, whimsical feel that would be appropriate for something like a fridge magnet. The design choices align well with items meant to be decorative and fun.",
