    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The edited image features a character with bold black outlines that sharply define the figure against the background. The shading on the character is not halftone but rather solid black and white, which creates a high-contrast effect typical of graphic design styles aiming for a bold visual impact. Halftone shading would involve small dots to create gradients, which are not present here.",
