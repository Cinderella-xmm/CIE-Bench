      "question": "Has the Hagia Sophia been transformed into a creature-like figure with a distinct body, head, or limb-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure of the Hagia Sophia has been edited to resemble a creature. The large dome and surrounding architecture have been integrated into a form that includes a spherical head-like shape at the top and a torso-like section below it. This transformation is evident through the addition of wing-like appendages extending from the sides, which are not typical architectural features but rather suggest limbs. The overall composition gives the impression of a fantastical being rather than a building.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the smaller domes on the sides of the structure appear as large, metallic, wing-like appendages extending outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smaller domes on the sides of the Hagia Sophia have been replaced with large, metallic-looking wings. These wings extend outward from the central structure, giving the appearance of a creature with outstretched wings. The metallic texture and the way they are positioned suggest they are meant to be interpreted as wings rather than domes. In contrast, in Image A, these are regular domes without any such modifications.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the four minarets been replaced with long, slender, leg-like structures that support the body of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original minarets of the Hagia Sophia have not been replaced with leg-like structures. Instead, they remain as tall, slender towers on either side of the main structure, similar to their appearance in Image A. There are no visible changes suggesting they now function as legs supporting a creature's body.",

      "question": "Are there glowing, intricate patterns resembling Byzantine art covering parts of the structureâ€™s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the structure does feature glowing, intricate patterns that resemble elements of Byzantine art. These patterns are particularly noticeable on the wings and the central body of the creature-like figure. They add a mystical and ornate quality to the image, which aligns with the style of detailed mosaics and artwork often associated with Byzantine culture. In Image A, the surface lacks such artistic embellishments.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the central dome been replaced with a large, jewel-like object that displays cosmic imagery such as stars, nebulae, or galaxies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central dome of the Hagia Sophia has indeed been replaced with a large, jewel-like object. This object appears to emit light and contains intricate designs that could be interpreted as cosmic imagery, including what looks like stars and possibly nebulae. This contrasts with Image A, where the central dome is a standard architectural feature without any cosmic or jewel-like qualities.",
