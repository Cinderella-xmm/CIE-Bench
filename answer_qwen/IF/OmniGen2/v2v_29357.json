      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground is visibly covered with a white layer that resembles snow.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plants in the background of Image B appear to be coated with a white substance that looks like frost. This is indicated by the way the branches and leaves seem to have a crystalline or icy appearance, which is typical of frost accumulation on vegetation during cold weather.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B conveys a chilly atmosphere due to the presence of snow and frost, which are associated with cold temperatures. The lighting is soft and diffused, lacking strong shadows, suggesting an overcast sky which often accompanies cold weather conditions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The child in Image B is not wearing a warm jacket. Instead, they are dressed in a short-sleeved shirt, which is not suitable for cold weather. This suggests that the child might be underdressed for the snowy environment depicted in the image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The child in Image B is wearing a cap, but it is not a beanie. It is a structured baseball-style cap, which does not provide the same level of warmth as a knit beanie typically worn in cold weather.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child's hands are covered with black gloves. This is evident from the visible dark material around the wrists and hands, which contrasts with the skin tone and provides protection against the cold environment.",
