      "question": "Are the walls of the cabin visibly transformed into bark-covered limbs with naturalistic textures and irregular shapes resembling tree trunks or branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The walls in Image B are composed of logs that have a natural, rustic appearance. However, they do not resemble bark-covered limbs or irregular shapes like tree trunks or branches. The logs maintain a consistent cylindrical shape typical of log cabins. Therefore, based on visual cues and common sense about tree structures, the transformation described is not evident.",
