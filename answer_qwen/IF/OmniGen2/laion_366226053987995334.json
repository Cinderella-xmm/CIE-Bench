      "question": "Are both feather earrings depicted with expressive facial features such as eyes and mouths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feather earrings are illustrated with clear cartoonish faces. Each earring has large, round eyes and a smiling mouth, which are typical characteristics of expressive facial features in cartoons. This conclusion is drawn from observing the distinct eyes and mouths on each feather.",

      "question": "Is one feather earring shown pulling the other along a visible path or trail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows one feather earring holding onto the other's hand, but there is no visible path or trail indicating movement. The action suggests they are together, but not necessarily that one is pulling the other along a specific trail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble in Image B contains the text 'Let's soor to new height today!' in the first panel and 'Let's soor heights today!' in the second panel. Neither matches the exact phrase 'Let's soar to new heights today!'. The differences in spelling and grammar indicate that the exact text is not present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters and background elements in Image B are indeed outlined with bold, thick lines, which is characteristic of comic-style illustrations. The colors used are vibrant and varied, including yellows, greens, blues, and blacks, making them non-monochromatic. This analysis is based on the visual inspection of the outlines and color palette.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the image presented within a comic-style panel with a border and background elements such as wind or a path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is clearly divided into two panels with borders, resembling a comic strip format. The background includes elements like a path and stylized clouds, which contribute to the comic-style presentation. These observations confirm the presence of a comic-style layout with appropriate background elements.",

      "question": "Do the feather characters display exaggerated cartoonish features (such as large eyes or stylized limbs) while retaining some realistic feather details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The feather earrings in Image B have large, round eyes and stylized arms, which are exaggerated cartoonish features. However, they also retain some realistic feather details, such as the patterned texture of the feathers. This combination of cartoonish exaggeration and realistic detail is evident upon close inspection.",
