      "question": "Is the butterfly depicted as a voxel-based 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B appears to have smooth surfaces and continuous gradients, which are not typical characteristics of voxel-based models. Voxel-based models usually exhibit a blocky or pixelated appearance due to their cubic structure. The butterfly's wings and body show fine details and realistic textures that suggest it is a polygonal 3D model rather than a voxel-based one.",

      "question": "Does the butterfly's design and style resemble the icons shown in the left image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an icon resembling the letter 'T' on the wooden surface. This icon has a simple, flat design with no depth or texture. In contrast, the butterfly is highly detailed with intricate patterns, realistic colors, and three-dimensional features. These differences indicate that the butterfly's design does not resemble the flat, simplistic style of the icon.",

      "question": "Was the butterfly rendered in Octane at 8k resolution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the butterfly in Image B exhibits high-quality rendering with detailed textures and realistic lighting, there is no direct evidence within the image to confirm that it was specifically rendered using Octane software or at an 8k resolution. Such specific technical details cannot be determined solely from visual inspection without additional information.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the butterfly exhibit three-dimensional characteristics such as depth and perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B shows clear signs of three-dimensionality. Its wings are spread out with visible curvature, and the body has a rounded shape. Shadows and highlights on the wings and body suggest depth and perspective, indicating that the butterfly is rendered with three-dimensional characteristics.",

      "question": "Does the butterfly display realistic lighting and shading effects indicative of being rendered in Octane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B displays sophisticated lighting and shading effects, such as soft shadows under the wings and subtle highlights on the edges. These effects contribute to a lifelike appearance. While these qualities are consistent with what can be achieved in advanced rendering software like Octane, they do not definitively prove that Octane was used, as similar results can be obtained with other high-end renderers.",
