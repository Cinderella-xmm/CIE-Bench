      "question": "Has the teapot been transformed into a candle holder with a visible candle or wick structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears to be a candle holder rather than a teapot. The presence of a glowing light inside and the absence of features like a spout or handle typical of a teapot suggest it is designed for holding a candle. The glow indicates the presence of a lit candle or similar light source.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the object in Image B shows transparency and reflective qualities characteristic of glass. Additionally, there are detailed embossed patterns that can be seen on its surface, which are consistent with decorative glasswork often used in candle holders.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the lid been redesigned into a decorative finial-style candle snuffer with a snuffing mechanism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lid in Image B has an ornate design resembling a finial, which is common in decorative candle snuffers. Its shape and position suggest it could function as a snuffer by covering the flame when placed over the opening of the candle holder.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the object resting on a smooth, reflective surface with a marbled pattern, which is distinctly different from the lace tablecloth in Image A. This change suggests a replacement with a more modern and elegant base.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
