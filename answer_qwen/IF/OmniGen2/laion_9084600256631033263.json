      "question": "Has the body of the car been transformed into a sleek, silver glass bottle that reflects the original car's curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a decanter with a rectangular shape and smooth lines. It does not reflect any curves or features typical of a car body. The transformation from a car to a bottle would require significant changes in form and structure, which are not evident here. The analysis is based on the visual cues of the object's shape and design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the original headlights been replaced with faceted glass stoppers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the decanter features two faceted glass elements that resemble stoppers. These do not resemble car headlights in any way. The comparison involves recognizing the function and appearance of headlights versus the decorative nature of the stoppers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a chrome-finish, gear-shaped lid on top of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the decanter in Image B has a circular gold-colored element that does not resemble a gear. A chrome finish and gear shape would imply industrial or mechanical design elements, which are not present. The conclusion is drawn from observing the material and shape of the object.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Datsun 1600 emblem embossed on the front of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decanter in Image B has an embossed emblem, but it contains text and symbols unrelated to the Datsun 1600. The emblem's content is specific to the decanter's branding, which differs from the car's emblem. This conclusion is reached by comparing the visible text and symbols on the decanter with known characteristics of the Datsun 1600 emblem.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the decanter design combine vintage styling (such as classic curves or script) with modern branding elements (such as clean lines or minimalist text)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decanter in Image B exhibits a combination of vintage and modern design elements. The use of classic script for the brand name suggests vintage styling, while the clean lines and minimalist text indicate modern branding. This assessment is based on analyzing the overall aesthetic and design choices presented in the image.",
