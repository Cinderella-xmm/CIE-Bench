      "question": "Has the peacock been transformed into a mythical lunar phoenix with a celestial, otherworldly appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the peacock exhibits features that are not typical of a real peacock but rather align with fantastical or mythical creatures. The presence of glowing elements, unusual feather patterns, and an overall ethereal quality suggest a transformation into something more mythical. The combination of these visual cues, along with the dark, starry background, supports the idea of a celestial, otherworldly appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the feathers exhibit a soft, silver-colored glow throughout their surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The feathers in Image B do not display a uniform silver-colored glow. Instead, they have vibrant blue and green hues with some areas illuminated by light, giving them a luminous quality. This is different from a soft, silver glow, which would imply a metallic sheen across the entire surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there radiant moonstone-like gems positioned at the center of each eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the eyes of the peacock do not contain moonstone-like gems. The eyes appear as natural bird eyes with a yellow iris and black pupil, consistent with what one would expect on a peacock. There are no visible gemstones or similar objects within the eyes.",

      "question": "Are there crescent moon-shaped decorative elements visible along the neck of the bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed crescent moon-shaped decorative elements visible along the neck of the bird. These elements are white and stand out against the blue plumage of the peacock's neck, adding to the mythical and celestial theme of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the original crest been replaced with translucent, shard-like selenite crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the crest of the peacock replaced with structures resembling translucent, shard-like crystals. These elements are bright and have a crystalline appearance, differing significantly from the typical feathered crest seen in real peacocks. This change contributes to the mythical and otherworldly aesthetic of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the peacock does not end in a comet-like trail of sparkling stardust particles. The tail feathers are depicted with a traditional peacock pattern, though they are stylized with vibrant colors and a glowing effect. There is no indication of a trail or stardust particles extending from the tail.",

      "question": "Is the background foliage still clearly visible and unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the background foliage in Image B is less distinct and has been altered to fit the mythical theme. It appears darker and more integrated into the night sky setting, with stars and a moon visible, unlike the clear and detailed foliage in Image A. Therefore, it is not unchanged.",
