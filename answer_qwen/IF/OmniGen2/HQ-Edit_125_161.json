    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the spiral staircase been fully replaced by a serpent-shaped form that follows the same helical path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show a large serpent winding its way up along the same curved path where the staircase was previously located. The serpent's body aligns with the helical structure of the staircase, indicating it has taken over the space and shape of the original staircase. This conclusion is drawn from observing the continuity of the curve and the absence of any steps.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the serpent’s body feature detailed lattice-like scales across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent in Image B displays a highly detailed texture on its body, consisting of small, interlocking scales that resemble a lattice pattern. This observation is based on the visible intricate design covering the entire body of the serpent, which mimics the appearance of scales commonly associated with reptiles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the serpent’s body extended downward in a way that visually replicates the step-like descent of the original staircase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent's body in Image B follows the same descending curve as the original staircase, creating an illusion similar to the step-like descent. Each coil of the serpent corresponds to where a step would have been, maintaining the visual rhythm of the staircase's descent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are ornate, filigree-like patterns present on the serpent’s body, matching the style of the original railing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent's body in Image B does not display ornate filigree-like patterns. Instead, it features detailed scales. Comparing this with Image A, the original railing had intricate designs, but these are not replicated on the serpent's body. The styles do not match.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the banister been replaced with a series of delicate, translucent fins along the serpent’s side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no translucent fins visible along the sides of the serpent. The banister from Image A has been replaced by the serpent's body itself, which lacks such features. The comparison shows that the banister's role is now fulfilled by the serpent's coiled form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a serpent’s head positioned at the uppermost point of the spiral, featuring two distinct luminescent gem-like eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the spiral in Image B, there is indeed a serpent's head with two glowing eyes that appear gem-like. This detail is clearly visible and matches the description provided. The presence of these features adds to the fantastical nature of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the serpent’s body display a marble-like texture with visible veining and polished surface characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent's body in Image B does not exhibit a marble-like texture. Instead, it has a scaly texture with detailed scales. Marble typically has a smooth surface with veining, which is not observed here. Therefore, the texture does not match that of marble.",
