      "question": "Is the sandcastle now presented as a scaled-down, highly detailed miniature 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandcastle in Image B appears as a highly detailed miniature 3D model, significantly smaller than what would be expected for a real sandcastle on a beach. The intricate details and the proportion relative to the surrounding elements suggest it is a scaled-down version. This conclusion is drawn from observing the size of the sandcastle compared to the seashells and the glass dome enclosing it.",

      "question": "Is the sandcastle enclosed within a transparent spherical glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the sandcastle enclosed within a transparent spherical glass dome. The dome's transparency allows a clear view of the sandcastle inside, and its spherical shape is evident from the curvature and reflections visible on its surface. This analysis is based on the visual cues of the dome's structure and its function as a protective cover for the sandcastle.",

      "question": "Is the glass dome placed on a sculpted base made of mahogany wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B is placed on a base that has the appearance of mahogany wood, characterized by its dark brown color and polished finish. The base provides a stable platform for the dome and sandcastle, which is consistent with how such models are typically displayed. The material and finish suggest it is made of or designed to look like mahogany wood.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are fine, glittering grains visibly applied to the surface of the sandcastle to simulate a sandy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no visible fine, glittering grains applied to the surface of the sandcastle. Instead, the sandcastle has a smooth texture that simulates a sandy appearance without the presence of glittering particles. This conclusion is based on the uniformity and matte finish observed on the sandcastle's surface.",

      "question": "Are tiny, ornately detailed seashells placed around the base of the sandcastle model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, tiny, ornately detailed seashells are indeed placed around the base of the sandcastle model. These shells vary in shape and size, adding to the aesthetic appeal and reinforcing the theme of a seaside setting. Their placement and detail are noticeable and contribute to the overall composition of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the entire model and surrounding elements have a soft, matte pearl-like finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire model and surrounding elements in Image B do not have a soft, matte pearl-like finish. Instead, the surfaces appear more polished and reflective, especially noticeable on the glass dome and the wooden base. The sandcastle itself has a matte finish but lacks the pearlescent quality. This assessment is based on the observed light reflections and surface textures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a ceramic plaque with the words “Empire of the Shores” elegantly inscribed and visible in front of the sandcastle. The text is legible and the plaque is positioned prominently, suggesting it serves as a title or description for the sandcastle model. This observation is based on the clarity and placement of the plaque within the image.",
