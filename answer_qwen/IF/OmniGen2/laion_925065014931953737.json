      "question": "Does the edited image depict the character with an oversized head and small, stubby limbs characteristic of chibi style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B has a disproportionately large head compared to its body, which is a hallmark of chibi art style. The limbs are short and stubby, further emphasizing the chibi aesthetic. This analysis is based on visual cues such as the size ratio between the head and body, and the overall proportions of the limbs.",
