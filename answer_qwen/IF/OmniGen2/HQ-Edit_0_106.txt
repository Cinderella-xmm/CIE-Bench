    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is depicted as a solid black shape against a lighter background. This high-contrast rendering lacks internal details such as fur texture or facial features, focusing instead on the outline and form of the lion. The edges are sharply defined, creating a clear silhouette effect. This style is commonly used in graphic design to emphasize form over detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of smooth color transitions from light to dark, forming an abstract gradient. There are no realistic elements like grass, sky, or clouds that would suggest a savannah landscape. This type of background is often used in stylized images to create a clean and focused look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground does not show detailed grass textures. Instead, it appears as a uniform dark area at the bottom of the image, consistent with the silhouette style used for the lion and trees. This suggests that the focus is on the overall composition rather than fine details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The acacia trees in Image B are rendered as simple, angular shapes with sharp edges, resembling geometric forms. They lack the detailed foliage seen in naturalistic depictions, aligning with the stylized approach used for the lion and other elements in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The title 'King of the Wild' is prominently displayed in a bold, dramatic font across the upper section of Image B. It is large enough to be noticeable but does not overshadow the lion, maintaining balance in the composition. The choice of font and placement enhances the theme without dominating the visual space.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:",
    "explanation": "The lion in Image B is centrally positioned and occupies a significant portion of the frame, making it the focal point of the image. Despite the presence of the title and trees, the lion's size and central placement ensure it remains the primary subject, drawing the viewer's attention immediately.",
    "answer": "Yes"
