      "question": "Has the dress been transformed into a translucent red-tinted glass flacon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is clearly a bottle with a red tint and a translucent appearance. The shape and structure are consistent with that of a perfume or fragrance bottle rather than a dress. The transformation from a garment to a bottle is evident through the change in form and material properties. The visual cues such as the liquid-like transparency and the structured shape support this conclusion.",

      "question": "Are petal motifs embossed across the surface of the flacon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bottle with visible red petal-like designs on its surface. These motifs appear to be integrated into the design of the bottle, giving it an ornate and floral aesthetic. The presence of these petal motifs can be inferred by observing their distinct shapes and placement against the red background of the bottle.",

      "question": "Does the bottle have an elegant cap resembling a stylized red flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap of the bottle in Image B is distinctly shaped like a red flower, with layered petals that give it an elegant and decorative appearance. This observation is based on the visual similarity between the cap's design and common representations of flowers in art and design.",

      "question": "Is there a metallic label with a cursive brand signature on the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a label on the bottle that appears metallic due to its reflective quality and golden color. The label includes a cursive script which suggests a brand signature. This detail is discernible by examining the textural and stylistic elements of the label.",

      "question": "Does the bottle maintain a sleek, elongated shape that mirrors the silhouette of the original dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the dress in Image A has a flowing, asymmetrical silhouette with a sheer fabric and floral embellishments. In contrast, the bottle in Image B has a more uniform and structured shape. While both share some elegance, the bottle does not mirror the complex silhouette of the dress. The bottle's shape is more geometric and less fluid.",
