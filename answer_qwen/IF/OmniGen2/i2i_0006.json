      "question": "Have the five dolls been transformed into chibi-style Russian nesting dolls with the smallest one able to fit inside the next larger one?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a set of five dolls that are designed in a style consistent with Russian nesting dolls, also known as matryoshka dolls. These dolls are characterized by their ability to fit inside each other, with each subsequent doll being smaller than the previous one. The chibi style is evident in the exaggerated features such as large heads and small bodies. The smallest doll appears proportionally sized to fit within the slightly larger one beside it, following the traditional design of nesting dolls.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the five chibi-style nesting dolls arranged from the largest on the outside to the smallest on the inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the arrangement of the dolls, they are indeed placed in a sequence where the largest doll is on the far right, and the size gradually decreases towards the left, ending with the smallest doll. This arrangement is typical for nesting dolls, allowing the smaller ones to be placed inside the larger ones in descending order of size.",

      "question": "Are the chibi-style nesting dolls placed on an elegant wooden table with visible wood grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls are positioned on a surface that appears to be a wooden table. The table has a polished finish with visible wood grain patterns, which suggests elegance and craftsmanship. The ornate drawer handle further supports the idea that this is a piece of fine furniture.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image have a horizontal aspect ratio of 3:2?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the aspect ratio, we would need to measure the width and height of the image. However, based on visual inspection, the image appears taller than it is wide, suggesting a vertical orientation rather than a horizontal one. A 3:2 aspect ratio typically indicates a landscape orientation, which does not match the observed portrait orientation of the image.",

      "question": "Do the chibi-style nesting dolls exhibit chibi features, such as proportionally large heads and small bodies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls in the image display characteristics typical of chibi art, including disproportionately large heads compared to their small bodies. This style is often used to create a cute and endearing appearance, which is evident in the design of these nesting dolls.",
