        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted with a glossy black finish. The visual cues such as the smooth texture and consistent dark coloration across the body suggest that the cat retains its black fur.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat wearing white-framed glasses. The presence of these glasses is evident due to their distinct shape and placement on the cat's face, which is not a natural feature for cats.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small rectangular object resembling a notebook placed near the cat's front paws. Its size, shape, and position relative to the cat suggest it is intended to be a notebook prop, enhancing the theme of the cat as an intellectual or professional figure.",
