        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scientist in the edited image has large, round eyes that are characteristic of cartoon or anime-style illustrations.

This style is common in educational materials or children's content.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In all six poses within the edited image, the scientist is consistently depicted wearing a white lab coat over a light blue shirt.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the edited image is indeed bright green and includes hexagonal patterns and chemical formula motifs, which align with the scientific theme. Each sticker is surrounded by some blank white space, likely to separate them visually and make each pose distinct.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers in the edited image do not appear to have an aspect ratio of 9:16. Instead, they seem to be square-shaped, which is more common for stickers or icons designed for easy viewing and recognition from various angles.",
