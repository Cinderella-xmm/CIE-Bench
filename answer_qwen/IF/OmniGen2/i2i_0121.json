      "question": "Does the character display exaggerated chibi proportions with a larger head and smaller body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character exhibits a style typical of chibi art, where the head is disproportionately large compared to the body. The body appears smaller and more compact, which is characteristic of chibi designs aimed at creating a cute and endearing appearance. This conclusion is drawn from observing the visual cues such as the size ratio between the head and body.",

      "question": "Is the character standing on a shell-shaped base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character positioned on what appears to be a colorful, shell-like structure beneath their feet. The shape and texture resemble that of a seashell, suggesting it is indeed a shell-shaped base. This analysis is based on the visual characteristics of the object under the character's feet.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi version retain the character's straw hat, red jacket, and cheerful expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B maintains key elements such as the straw hat with a red ribbon, a red jacket, and a cheerful facial expression. These features are consistent with the original design but adapted into a chibi style. The retention of these elements ensures the character remains recognizable despite the stylistic changes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the characterâ€™s features (like buttons on the jacket and belt) simplified but still recognizable in the chibi design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's jacket has visible buttons and a belt, though they are simplified to fit the chibi aesthetic. The buttons are fewer and less detailed, while the belt is represented by a simple yellow strap. Despite this simplification, these features remain identifiable due to their placement and basic form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shell-shaped base in Image B is distinctly visible beneath the character's feet. Its vibrant colors and clear outline make it stand out against the background, ensuring it is easily noticeable. The clarity of the base is enhanced by its contrast with the sandy beach setting.",
