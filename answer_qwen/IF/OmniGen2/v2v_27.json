      "question": "Does the wombat in the stickers have overly large, expressive eyes and gentle facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wombat's eyes are indeed large and round, which is a common stylistic choice in cartoon illustrations to convey expressiveness and appeal. The facial features are soft and rounded, contributing to a gentle appearance. This style is often used to make characters appear friendly and approachable. By analyzing the visual cues of the eyes and overall face shape, it is clear that the design aims for an expressive and gentle look.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows six different stickers with the wombat in various poses. Each sticker depicts a unique action or expression, such as pointing, crying, smiling, sleeping, showing affection, and carrying a backpack. These poses are distinct and clearly differentiated from one another based on body language and facial expressions. Therefore, the analysis confirms that there are six distinct poses.",

      "question": "Is the wombat wearing a fun Hawaiian shirt and straw hat similar to those in the reference image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wombat is dressed in a green shirt with orange circular patterns and a straw hat, which aligns with the tropical theme commonly associated with Hawaiian attire. Comparing this with Image A, where the wombat also wears a similar shirt and hat, it can be concluded that the clothing in Image B is consistent with the reference image. The analysis combines visual information about the clothing style and thematic consistency.",

      "question": "Do the stickers include bright tropical tones with hibiscus flowers, palm fronds, or fruity drink designs in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a yellow background with decorative elements like red hibiscus flowers and green palm fronds at the corners. These elements are typical of a tropical theme. There are no fruity drink designs visible in the background. However, the presence of hibiscus flowers and palm fronds supports the use of bright tropical tones in the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the stickers designed with a dimension ratio of 9:16?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers in Image B appear square-shaped, suggesting a 1:1 aspect ratio rather than a 9:16 ratio. Commonly, a 9:16 ratio would imply a rectangular shape suitable for vertical display, such as on mobile screens. Since the stickers are visually square, they do not match the 9:16 dimension ratio.",
