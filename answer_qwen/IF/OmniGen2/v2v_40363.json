      "question": "Is the entire image composed of small, distinct mosaic tiles with visible grout lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show a clear pattern of small, square tiles that make up the entire artwork. The grout lines between these tiles are distinctly visible, creating a grid-like structure typical of mosaic art. This observation is consistent with the characteristics of mosaic designs where individual pieces (tiles) are arranged to form an image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image vivid and saturated, particularly the red heart balloon and the child's features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors appear bright and highly saturated. The red heart balloon stands out prominently against the background due to its vivid coloration. The children's features also exhibit strong, saturated hues which contribute to the overall vibrancy of the image. This analysis aligns with common practices in mosaic art where bold colors are often used to enhance visual impact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the outlines of the heart balloon and the child clearly defined and emphasized in the mosaic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outlines in Image B are sharply defined by thick black lines that separate the different elements of the image, such as the heart balloon and the children. This is a characteristic feature of mosaic art, where outlines are often accentuated to maintain clarity despite the fragmented nature of the medium.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the overall composition and all essential elements from the original image been maintained in the mosaic version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B independently, it contains two children holding heart-shaped balloons, similar to the theme in Image A. The composition includes the same key elements like the heart balloons and the interaction between the children. Comparing this with Image A, the essential components have been preserved, though the style has changed to a mosaic format.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the material of the artwork reflect the characteristics of ceramic mosaic tiles, such as a glossy or matte finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual appearance of Image B, the tiles seem to have a glossy finish, which is typical for ceramic mosaics. This can be inferred from the way light appears to reflect off the surface of the tiles, giving them a shiny look. This characteristic is commonly associated with ceramic materials used in mosaic art.",
