      "question": "Is the central figure in the edited image now a robot horse rather than a biological horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is a horse with distinct mechanical features such as exposed joints and a metallic shell. These characteristics are not typical of a biological horse but rather suggest a robotic design. The presence of these mechanical elements indicates that the figure has been transformed into a robot horse.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image maintain the same posture as the original horse, with its head lowered as if grazing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The biomechanical horse in Image B is depicted with its head lowered towards the ground, which is consistent with a grazing posture. This posture is similar to what one would expect from a biological horse grazing. Comparing this with Image A, where the original animal (a cow) was walking, it's clear that the posture has been altered to mimic a grazing horse.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image have a silver-white metallic shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse in Image B appears to have a silver-white metallic shell covering its body. This is evident from the reflective and smooth surface texture, which is characteristic of metal rather than the fur or hide of a biological horse. The color and finish align with common depictions of robotic entities.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are exposed joint mechanisms visible on the biomechanical horse in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse exhibits visible joint mechanisms at its limbs and other parts of its body. These joints are exposed and appear to be part of the robot's structure, allowing for movement. Such features are indicative of a biomechanical design and are not present in biological horses.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image have glowing red sensor eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes of the biomechanical horse in Image B are glowing red, which is an artificial feature often used to signify sensors or cameras in robotic designs. Biological horses do not have glowing eyes, so this is a clear indication of the horse being a robot with sensor eyes.",
