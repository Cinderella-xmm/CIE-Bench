      "question": "Has the head been slightly enlarged compared to the original body proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head appears disproportionately larger relative to the body. This is evident by comparing the size of the head to the shoulders and torso, which seem smaller in comparison. The visual cues suggest a stylized or exaggerated portrayal typical of caricatures, where certain features are amplified for effect. Without directly referring to Image A, this observation is based on common artistic techniques used in cartoonification.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the body been cartoonified with flattened colors and simple shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body in Image B exhibits characteristics of cartoonification. The colors appear uniform and lack detailed shading, creating a flat appearance. Additionally, the shapes are simplified, with smooth lines and minimal texture, which aligns with typical cartoon styles. These observations are made independently of Image A, focusing solely on the visual elements present in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the edited subject placed against a background resembling a bookshelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background that clearly resembles a bookshelf filled with books. The arrangement and appearance of the books, along with the wooden shelves, are consistent with what one would expect from a library or study setting. This analysis is based on the visual information provided in Image B alone.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial features such as the eyes, smile, and proportions accurately maintained after enlarging the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the head being enlarged, the facial features like the eyes and smile in Image B maintain a recognizable likeness to human features. The proportions, while slightly exaggerated due to the enlargement, still adhere closely enough to realistic human anatomy to be considered accurate within the context of a caricature. Comparing this to Image A, the same facial features appear more natural but less exaggerated, confirming the maintenance of accuracy post-editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cartoonified body appear separate from and non-intrusive to the realistic face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonified body does not interfere with the realistic depiction of the face. The face retains its detailed and lifelike qualities, while the body adopts a simpler, cartoonish style. This separation ensures that the realism of the face is preserved despite the stylization of the rest of the figure. Comparing with Image A, the original image has a uniformly realistic style, whereas Image B intentionally separates these elements for artistic effect.",
