        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a dog displayed in a setting that resembles a museum exhibit.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog is clearly visible inside a transparent enclosure with a wooden frame, which is characteristic of a glass display case used to protect and showcase items in museums or galleries.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in the image is directed towards the dog's face, highlighting it as the focal point of the exhibit. This type of lighting is commonly used in displays to draw attention to specific features of the subject being showcased.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is a label adjacent to the dog within the display case that includes text, which appears to describe the breed and possibly contains a story title. This is inferred from the layout and placement of the text, which is consistent with how information is typically presented in museum exhibits.",
