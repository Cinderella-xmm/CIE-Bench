      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "explanation": "Panel 1 of Image B includes a text box with the message “Why won’t you connect!

The slight differences in spelling suggest a humorous or intentional error for comedic effect.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 1 of Image B shows a workspace that includes computer screens displaying code, stray coffee cups, and tangled wires, indicating a chaotic environment.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 of Image B does not show a cleaner desk with glowing code cascading across the screens. Instead, it depicts the same character with a cheerful expression and a different speech bubble. The background remains consistent with the previous panel, maintaining the cluttered workspace. The comparison involves noting the continuity of the setting between the two panels.",
