      "question": "Is the character created as a Q-style 3D C4D-rendered figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B exhibits characteristics typical of 3D C4D-rendered figures, such as smooth shading, clean lines, and a polished appearance. The style is consistent with Q-style characters, which are often designed to be cute and appealing. The visual cues suggest that this is indeed a 3D rendered figure created using C4D software.",

      "question": "Does the character retain the original facial features and character pose from the input image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B retains the original facial features like the pearl earring and headscarf from the input image. However, the pose has been altered to a full-body stance facing forward, which differs from the original painting's three-quarter view. The analysis combines visual cues from both images to compare the consistency of features while noting changes in pose.",

      "question": "Has the character been stylized with a cute, long-legged chibi proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B does not exhibit chibi proportions, particularly long legs. Instead, the proportions appear more standard for a 3D-rendered human figure. The analysis relies on comparing the character's body proportions against common chibi design elements, concluding that the character lacks those specific stylistic traits.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outfit includes trendy designer wear such as a stylish coat and glasses, but there is no sketchbook or tablet present. The shoes also appear appropriate for a fashion designer. The analysis involves identifying each item in the outfit and assessing its relevance to the question, leading to the conclusion that not all specified items are included.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B follows a 9:16 aspect ratio, with the top text \"OOTD\" clearly visible. The left side shows the full-body character, and the right side displays individual clothing items and accessories separately. This layout matches the description provided in the question, confirming the composition details.",
