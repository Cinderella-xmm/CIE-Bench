    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the aircraft rendered in a stylized 3D model form rather than a photorealistic representation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The aircraft in Image B appears to be a stylized 3D model due to its smooth surfaces, uniform lighting, and lack of detailed textures that would typically be present in a photorealistic image. The edges are clean and the overall appearance is consistent with digital rendering techniques rather than a photograph of a real object.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft is clearly visible inside a transparent structure with defined edges that resemble a glass display case. The case has a solid frame and a lid, which fully encloses the aircraft, indicating it is indeed encased within such a structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display case in Image B features accents that appear to be made of leather, as suggested by their brown color and texture. These accents are located at the top and bottom edges of the case, providing a contrast to the transparent glass and giving the impression of worn leather.",

    },
    {

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The corners of the display case in Image B are fitted with metallic elements that have a brass-like color. These fittings are shiny and reflective, consistent with the appearance of brass hardware commonly used on vintage or decorative cases.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the front face of the display case in Image B, there is an emblem that appears to be engraved or embossed. It is circular with intricate details, suggesting a design that could represent an organization or brand, typical of emblems found on high-quality display cases.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small, artificial clouds placed inside the glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the glass display case in Image B, there are white, fluffy objects resembling clouds. They are strategically placed beneath the aircraft, enhancing the visual effect of the aircraft being in flight. This artistic choice adds to the thematic presentation of the model.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the aircraft oriented diagonally upward within the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The aircraft in Image B is positioned at an angle within the display case, with its nose pointing diagonally upward. This orientation gives the impression of ascent, which is a common way to display aircraft models to convey movement and dynamism.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do the propellers of the aircraft show visual effects indicating they are spinning (e.g., motion blur or rotational distortion)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The propellers of the aircraft in Image B do not show any signs of motion blur or rotational distortion. They appear static, with clear and distinct blades, indicating that the model is not designed to simulate spinning propellers in this particular representation.",
