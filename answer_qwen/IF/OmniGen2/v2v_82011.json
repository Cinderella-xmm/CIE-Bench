      "question": "Do the dolls have bold calligraphic outlines around them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls are depicted with bold outlines that resemble calligraphic strokes. This is a common stylistic choice in certain types of illustrations to emphasize the shapes and forms of the subjects.

      "question": "Are the dolls' clothing and hair depicted using flat planes of color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dolls' clothing and hair using flat planes of color without detailed shading or texture. This style is typical in simplified illustrations where the focus is on form and color rather than realistic detail. The lack of gradients or intricate patterns supports this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the store environment been replaced with a subtly patterned, simplified background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B has been replaced with a plain, subtly patterned design that lacks the detailed store environment seen in Image A. This simplification focuses attention on the dolls themselves, which is a common technique in edited images to enhance the main subjects.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the doll in the foreground maintains a ballet pose with arms extended outward, similar to a classic ballet stance. The tutu is light-colored, consistent with traditional ballet attire. This depiction aligns with the original pose but in a more stylized illustration format.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seated doll in Image B is indeed positioned on a fuchsia mat, wearing a pink top. This matches the description provided, indicating that despite the change in artistic style, the key elements of the doll's position and attire remain consistent.",
