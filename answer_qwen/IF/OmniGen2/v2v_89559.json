      "question": "Have the 'Search for a Star' and 'Rising Star' logos been transformed into stylized, gleaming golden award statuettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Search for a Star' and 'Rising Star' logos have not been transformed into golden award statuettes. They retain their original stylized text and star designs but with some color changes. The analysis is based on observing that the shapes and structures of the logos remain consistent with typical logo designs rather than resembling three-dimensional statuettes.",

      "question": "Has the background been changed to a rich, dark velvet curtain, replacing the original green background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a background that has been changed to a rich, dark velvet curtain. This is evident from the deep red color and the texture that resembles fabric folds, which contrasts sharply with the green gradient background in Image A. The change aligns with common practices in graphic design where backgrounds are altered to evoke different moods or themes.",

      "question": "Is the 'Sumo Digital' logo rendered as an embossed seal on a polished wooden plaque beneath the 'Rising Star' logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'Sumo Digital' logo in Image B is not rendered as an embossed seal on a wooden plaque beneath the 'Rising Star' logo. Instead, it appears as part of the logo set alongside other elements. Comparing this with Image A, where the 'Sumo Digital' logo is similarly placed, there's no indication of a wooden plaque or embossing effect in either image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'Character Art Directory 2018' text in Image B is not presented in engraved silver lettering. It appears in white font against the dark background, maintaining readability and contrast. In Image A, the same text is also in white, indicating no transformation into silver engraving occurred between the two images.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The structural integrity of the original image has been maintained while applying specified changes in Image B. The logos and text placements remain similar, with only the background and some color adjustments made. This suggests that the core layout and composition were preserved during the editing process.",
