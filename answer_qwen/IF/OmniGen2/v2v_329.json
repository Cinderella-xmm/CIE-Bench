      "question": "Are the bicycles depicted in a 3D chibi style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles are rendered with exaggerated proportions and simplified features typical of chibi art. The wheels appear smaller relative to the frames, and the overall design is more cartoonish compared to realistic depictions. This style is often used in 3D models for a playful or cute aesthetic.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bicycles in Image B are arranged in a similar manner as they were in Image A, with each bicycle positioned side by side in a row. The spacing between them appears consistent, suggesting that the arrangement has been maintained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B with Image A, the colors of the bicycles have changed. In Image A, the bicycles had distinct colors like red, blue, white, and black. In Image B, the colors are altered to blue, yellow, and black, indicating a change from the original.",

      "question": "Do the bicycles retain their original design details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bicycles in Image B have been stylized into a chibi form, which simplifies and exaggerates certain features. This results in a loss of finer design details present in the original bicycles shown in Image A. For example, the handlebars and frame designs are less intricate.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene composition in Image B closely mirrors that of Image A, with the same window and reflective floor. The lighting also appears consistent, maintaining the warm tone and shadows cast by the window. These elements suggest that the overall scene composition and lighting have been kept similar.",
