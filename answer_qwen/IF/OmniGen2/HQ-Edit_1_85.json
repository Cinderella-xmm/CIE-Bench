      "question": "Is the edited image presented as a series of separate postcard-sized panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blouse in the edited image features lace details that appear to be rendered with sharp, layered edges, consistent with a paper-cut style. This is evident from the clean lines and defined borders around the lace patterns, which are characteristic of cut-out designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the violin appears disproportionately large compared to the girl's body. This exaggeration is a common artistic technique used to emphasize certain elements within an illustration, making the violin stand out more prominently.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The girl’s pose in the edited image shows a refined hand placement on the violin, a posture that suggests she is deeply engaged in playing. Her facial expression also conveys focus and musical expression, enhancing the overall sense of performance.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual appearance of the edited image has a warm off-white tone and a soft matte finish, which is consistent with being printed on textured cream stock. This type of finish gives the image a gentle, vintage feel, aligning with the artistic style of the illustration.",
