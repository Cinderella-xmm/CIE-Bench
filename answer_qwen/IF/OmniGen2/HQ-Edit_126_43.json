    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the antique clock been transformed into a sentient, mechanical creature resembling a steampunk sentinel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B suggest that the clock has been modified with features typically associated with steampunk aesthetics and mechanical creatures. The addition of limb-like structures and steam vents implies a transformation into a more animate form. The overall design evokes a sense of a machine with purposeful movement, aligning with the concept of a steampunk sentinel.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there gear-based limb-like appendages extending from the clock’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clearly visible appendages extending from the sides of the clock. These appendages are composed of gears and pipes, which resemble mechanical limbs. This is consistent with the steampunk theme where machinery is often anthropomorphized with such elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has one of the clock faces been replaced with a monocled eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, both clock faces remain intact and no monocled eye is present. The clock faces still display traditional time-telling mechanisms without any modifications to include an eye.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the pendulum been transformed into a swinging tail-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pendulum area does not show any transformation into a tail-like structure. Instead, it appears to maintain its original function as part of the clock's mechanism, though it may be stylized differently.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature’s body feature brass and copper-colored metallic surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the clock with a golden hue, suggesting the use of materials like brass or copper. This coloration is typical in steampunk designs, where such metals are used for their aesthetic appeal and association with industrial-era technology.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there steam valves visibly protruding from the corners or joints of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, steam is visibly emanating from pipe-like structures on either side of the clock. These pipes resemble steam valves, which are common in steampunk designs to emphasize the mechanical and industrial aspects of the creation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible intricate engravings or decorative patterns along the body of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays detailed engravings and patterns along the body of the clock. These decorative elements enhance the steampunk aesthetic by adding complexity and a sense of craftsmanship to the mechanical design.",
