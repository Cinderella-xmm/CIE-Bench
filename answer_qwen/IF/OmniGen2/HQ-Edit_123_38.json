    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image presented as part of a multi-panel postcard set with a gymnastics theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The image appears to be a single illustration with no indication of being part of a multi-panel set. There are no visual cues such as multiple sections or connecting elements that would suggest it is one of several images in a series. The design is self-contained and focused on the gymnast.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the contortionist’s silhouette feature visible brushstroke textures across its form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the figure, there are no visible brushstroke textures across its form. The silhouette is smooth and lacks any artistic strokes that would indicate a painted texture. The image seems digitally rendered rather than hand-painted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the hands significantly enlarged compared to the rest of the body to emphasize grip strength?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The hands of the contortionist appear proportionate relative to the rest of the body. There is no exaggeration in size that would emphasize grip strength beyond natural proportions. The focus seems to be on the overall posture rather than specific features like hand size.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the legs visibly elongated beyond natural proportions to enhance dynamic movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The legs of the figure do not appear elongated beyond natural proportions. They maintain a realistic length consistent with human anatomy. The dynamic movement is conveyed through the pose rather than exaggerated limb lengths.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are gradients of blue and silver applied across the figure’s form to highlight shape and contour?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The figure's form does feature gradients of blue and silver. These colors are applied smoothly across the leotard and skin, highlighting the contours and shapes of the body. This use of color enhances the three-dimensional appearance of the figure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are swirling ribbons and star motifs present in the image to convey action and dynamism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Swirling ribbons and star motifs are indeed present in the image. These elements add a decorative and dynamic quality, suggesting motion and energy around the central figure. They contribute to the overall theme of gymnastics and performance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the image displayed on panels with matte finish and rounded corners, resembling collectible postcards?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The image is displayed within a rectangular frame with clean edges, resembling a collectible postcard. However, there are no rounded corners or indications of a matte finish. It looks more like a digital illustration framed for presentation.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    }
