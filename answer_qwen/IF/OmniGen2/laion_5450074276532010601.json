      "question": "Are the two table tennis paddles illustrated as cartoon characters with distinct facial features and accessories (one with a red helmet, the other with a blue cap)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table tennis paddles are not illustrated as cartoon characters with distinct facial features or accessories. They appear as standard red and black paddles without any human-like characteristics. The analysis is based on visual observation of the paddles in the image, which do not exhibit any anthropomorphic traits.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image vivid and saturated, using bright tones such as red, blue, gold, and green to emphasize an adventurous theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B are indeed vivid and saturated. The use of bright tones such as red for the paddle, blue for the cap on the character, gold for the treasure chest edges, and green for the background suggests an adventurous theme. This conclusion is drawn from observing the color palette and its thematic consistency with adventure motifs commonly found in children's illustrations.",

      "question": "Is the box depicted as a treasure chest with visible golden edges that appear to shimmer or glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box in Image B is depicted as a treasure chest with visible golden edges that give the appearance of shimmering or glowing. This is inferred from the bright gold color and the way it contrasts with the other elements in the image, suggesting a magical or valuable object typical of treasure chests in adventure-themed illustrations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a speech bubble above the paddles containing the text \"Ready for the ultimate match quest!\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no speech bubble above the paddles containing the text 'Ready for the ultimate match quest!' in Image B. Instead, there is a speech bubble near the treasure chest with a different message. The analysis is based on the absence of the specified text and its location relative to the paddles.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the paddles positioned as if leaping or springing from the treasure chest toward a background that features a sketched treasure map?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The paddles in Image B are not positioned as if leaping or springing from the treasure chest. They are placed upright next to the chest, and there is no indication of motion or interaction between them and the chest. The background does feature a sketched treasure map, but the paddles' positioning does not suggest movement toward it.",
