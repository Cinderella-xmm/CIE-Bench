      "question": "Is the entire figure rendered with a dark wood texture resembling an ancient African sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues suggest that the figure is indeed rendered with a dark wood texture. The skin and clothing appear to have a carved, wooden quality, consistent with what one might expect from an ancient African sculpture. This conclusion is drawn by observing the uniform texture and coloration across the figure, which mimics the appearance of polished wood.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns on the clothing in Image B are clearly visible as deeply incised lines and shapes, resembling carved reliefs rather than the typical texture of fabric. This is evident from the sharpness and depth of the lines, which are characteristic of carvings rather than woven or printed fabric patterns.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beaded crown and earrings in Image B are depicted with bright, vivid colors that contrast sharply with the dark wood texture of the rest of the figure. These elements appear to be painted onto the wooden surface, making them stand out prominently against the carved background.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B has been transformed into a series of low-relief carvings. The details of the jungle scene, such as leaves and branches, are now depicted with visible texture and depth, giving the impression of a carved relief rather than a painted or photographic backdrop.",
