      "question": "Is the background showing an African savanna scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts a wide expanse of grassland with scattered trees, which is characteristic of a savanna landscape. The golden hue of the grass and the flat horizon are typical features of African savannas. Additionally, the presence of the Milky Way suggests a location far from urban light pollution, which is common in remote areas like the African savanna.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the image set against a dark, night-time sky indicative of nighttime?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in the image is dark and filled with stars, including the Milky Way, which is only visible at night when there is minimal light pollution. This clearly indicates that the photo was taken during nighttime.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the Milky Way clearly visible in the sky above the savanna?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Milky Way is distinctly visible as a dense band of stars stretching across the night sky. Its visibility is enhanced by the absence of light pollution, allowing for clear observation of this celestial feature above the savanna.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Besides the Milky Way, numerous individual stars are scattered throughout the sky. These stars vary in brightness and size, contributing to the rich tapestry of the night sky above the savanna.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "There are no trains or railway tracks present in the image. The scene is entirely composed of a natural savanna landscape under a starry sky. Therefore, it is not possible for them to be integrated into the background.",
