    "Question": "Q1:"
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tree and surrounding elements are clearly delineated by dark lines that segment the image into distinct areas. These segments resemble stained glass panels due to their geometric contours and the way they divide the scene into flat, colored sections. This style is characteristic of stained glass art, where images are created using pieces of colored glass separated by metal frames.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:"
    "explanation": "The branches of the tree in Image B appear to be composed of angular shapes rather than smooth, organic curves. This is evident from the sharp edges and straight lines that define the branches, which align with the geometric nature of stained glass design. In contrast, natural tree branches typically have more fluid and irregular forms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:"
    "explanation": "The grass in Image B is rendered in vibrant, saturated colors such as green and yellow, which do not match a muted palette. The use of bright, solid colors is consistent with the stained glass style depicted in the image, aiming for visual impact rather than subdued tones.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:"
    "explanation": "The mountains in Image B are indeed depicted with sharp, angular forms, fitting the geometric aesthetic of the overall image. They are colored in shades of teal and darker hues, which contribute to the stylized appearance typical of stained glass artwork. The choice of bronze is not apparent here.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:"
    "explanation": "The sky in Image B features a gradient effect but also includes accentuated lines and decorative patterns around the edges, particularly in the upper corners. These elements add a vintage elegance to the composition, enhancing the artistic feel of the stained glass style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:"
    "explanation": "The elements in Image B are composed of flat, solid-colored regions that are bounded by dark, defined lines. This is a hallmark of stained glass art, where each section is filled with a single color and separated by bold outlines to create a cohesive and visually striking image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
