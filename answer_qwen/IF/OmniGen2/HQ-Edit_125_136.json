    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the title “Astronaut and Space Station Dynamics” present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title visible in Image B is 'ASTRONTN AND SPACE DYNAMICS', which appears to be a misspelling or stylized version of 'Astronaut and Space Dynamics'. The presence of this text, despite the spelling discrepancy, indicates that the intended title is indeed represented.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the astronaut, Moon, and ISS depicted using simplified, vector-style shapes rather than photorealistic rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut, Moon, and ISS are illustrated with clean lines and flat colors, typical of vector graphics. There is no attempt at photorealism; instead, the elements have a cartoonish and simplified appearance, confirming the use of vector-style shapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the spacesuit include visible textural details such as stitching or fabric patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spacesuit in Image B lacks detailed textures like stitching or fabric patterns. It is rendered in a smooth, uniform style consistent with vector illustrations, which typically do not include fine textural details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are gold accents used in the image to emphasize certain elements such as labels, borders, or arrows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features several yellow-gold elements, including numbers and arrow tips, which serve to highlight specific parts of the infographic. These accents stand out against the darker background and other colors, effectively drawing attention to key information.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there three sequential stages illustrated with arrows showing the astronaut's movement toward or interaction with the space station?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a sequence of the astronaut's movement toward or interaction with the space station. Instead, it shows a single astronaut figure standing on the Moon with the ISS in the background. There are no arrows indicating movement or interaction stages.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the labels “Step 1: Prepare”, “Step 2: Navigate”, and “Step 3: Operate” displayed in sequence along the bottom of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The labels in Image B are not exactly as described. While there are steps labeled, they are titled 'STEP 1: NAVPARE', 'NAVIGARLE', and 'OPERATATE', which appear to be misspellings or stylistic variations. They are also not located at the bottom but are part of the central content area.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the entire infographic arranged in a vertical format with elements stacked from top to bottom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a layout where elements are primarily organized horizontally across the page rather than vertically. The title, astronaut illustration, and step-by-step process are laid out side by side, not stacked from top to bottom.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
