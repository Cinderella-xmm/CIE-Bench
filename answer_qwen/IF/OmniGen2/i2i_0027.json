      "question": "Has the dog been converted into a chibi-style blind box figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog has been stylized with exaggerated features such as large eyes and a small body, which are characteristic of chibi-style figures. The overall design is cute and simplified, resembling a collectible blind box figure. This conclusion is drawn from observing the visual cues like the proportions and style of the dog.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dog’s body still in the prone, ball-focused pose after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is sitting upright on a base, holding a tennis ball in its paws. This pose is different from the prone position focused on a ball seen in Image A. By comparing the two images, it's clear that the dog’s posture has been changed to fit the new artistic style and purpose of the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the dog's head been enlarged slightly compared to its original size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's head appears disproportionately larger compared to its body, which is a common feature in chibi-style art. Comparing this with Image A, where the dog's head size seems more natural relative to its body, it can be concluded that the head has indeed been enlarged in the edit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tennis ball placed so that it touches the dog's nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball is held between the dog's front paws, not touching its nose. Observing the spatial relationship between the ball and the dog's face confirms that the ball does not make contact with the nose. Therefore, based on the visual information provided, the answer is clear.",

      "question": "Does the base feature a relief tennis ball pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B features a solid yellow color with the text 'BILABBO' and no visible relief patterns or textures resembling a tennis ball. Based on this observation, there is no evidence of a relief tennis ball pattern on the base.",
