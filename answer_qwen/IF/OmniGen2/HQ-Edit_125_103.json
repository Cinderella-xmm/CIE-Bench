      "question": "Is the teapot now a cylindrical container instead of its original rounded shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is clearly a cylindrical container with a flat top and bottom. This is evident from the straight sides and circular top view. The original teapot in Image A had a rounded body with a spout and handle, which are not present here. Therefore, the analysis confirms that the shape has changed from rounded to cylindrical.",

      "question": "Are floral patterns embossed in golden foil on the surface of the teapot container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cylindrical container with decorative elements. There are indeed floral patterns visible on the surface, but they appear as printed designs rather than embossed textures. Golden foil typically gives a raised, shiny appearance, which is not observed here. Thus, while there are floral patterns, they are not embossed in golden foil.",

      "question": "Are the teacups redesigned as nested stackable units, each with a decorative lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any teacups or lids. It only shows a single cylindrical container with no indication of nested stackable units or lids. In contrast, Image A features multiple teacups with saucers and a teapot, none of which are present in Image B. Therefore, based on the visual information in Image B alone, this statement is false.",

      "question": "Is there Japanese calligraphy displayed across the top of the packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is text written in what appears to be Japanese characters near the top of the cylindrical container. These characters have the stylistic qualities typical of Japanese calligraphy, such as flowing strokes and artistic arrangement. Hence, it can be concluded that Japanese calligraphy is indeed displayed.",

      "question": "Is a bamboo motif visible along the side of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are vertical lines resembling bamboo stalks along the side of the cylindrical container. These lines are consistent with common representations of bamboo in design, suggesting a bamboo motif. Therefore, based on the visual cues and common design knowledge, the presence of a bamboo motif can be confirmed.",

      "question": "Is the entire tea set packaging presented on a flat white surface with no other background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cylindrical container placed on a completely white background with no additional elements or textures. The surface beneath the container also appears flat and uniform in color. This presentation style is typical for product photography where the focus is solely on the item without distractions. Thus, the description matches the visual evidence.",
