    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The main visual in Image B is a side portrait of an individual with monochrome coloring, which suggests it uses only black and white. The style appears to be screen-printed due to the high contrast and bold lines typical of this printing method. This conclusion is drawn from observing the stark contrast and the texture that resembles screen printing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",

    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "By analyzing the text on the ticket in Image B, it's clear that while some details match (such as the artist name "Jax Bennett" and the venue "The Paramount Theatre"), other specifics like the tour title, date, time, and seat information do not align with what is stated in the question. For example, the date provided in the image does not specify 'Saturday, Aug 17, 2024,' nor does it provide a row number for the seat.",
