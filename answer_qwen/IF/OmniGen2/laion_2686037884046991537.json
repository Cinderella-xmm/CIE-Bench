      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image formatted as a two-panel comic with the title \"The Whoopie Pie Chronicles\" displayed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is clearly divided into two panels, each with a speech bubble and characters. However, there is no visible title 'The Whoopie Pie Chronicles' in the image. The analysis is based on the visual structure of the image which shows a comic format but lacks the specified title.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the whoopie pies have cartoon-style facial expressions (eyes, mouths) and limbs to represent them as expressive characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The whoopie pies in the image are depicted with simplistic cartoon-style features including stick-like limbs and appear to be anthropomorphized as characters. This conclusion is drawn from observing the visual elements that give them a character-like appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the chocolate tops and creamy centers still clearly visible and used as the primary shapes for the characters’ heads and bodies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The primary shapes of the characters are indeed the chocolate tops and creamy centers of the whoopie pies, which form their heads and bodies respectively. This is evident from the visual design where these parts of the whoopie pies are used to create the characters.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a playful kitchen scene with recognizable kitchen elements (e.g., stove, sink, utensils)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background does not depict a kitchen scene with recognizable elements like a stove, sink, or utensils. Instead, it appears to be a simple colored backdrop without detailed kitchen elements. This conclusion is based on the absence of such details in the visual content.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "In the first panel, are two whoopie pie characters positioned on the edge of the plate, looking over with curious expressions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the first panel, the whoopie pie characters are not positioned on the edge of a plate nor do they display curious expressions. They are standing on what appears to be a countertop. The analysis is based on the positioning and posture of the characters within the panel.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 1 contains a speech bubble with text that reads 'I Whoo today flaor piey is mint! Let find itit!', which is similar but not exactly the same as 'I heard today’s flavor is mint! Let’s find it!'. The font appears handwritten and legible. The comparison involves recognizing the slight differences in wording.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2, one of the whoopie pie characters is holding an object resembling a spatula, and its posture suggests leading forward. This is inferred from the visual depiction of the character's stance and the object it holds.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 contains a speech bubble with text that reads 'To the minet Le’s the minetty mountains s!', which is similar but not exactly 'To the minty mountains!'. The font is handwritten and consistent with the style in Panel 1. The reasoning involves noting the slight variations in the text.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All characters in the image have bold, thick outlines and are colored with vibrant, flat colors without gradients or shading. This is observed through the clear, distinct lines and uniform color application throughout the characters.",
