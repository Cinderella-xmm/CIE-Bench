      "question": "Is the image rendered in a mural-like artistic style with flat colors, symbolic patterns, and a non-photorealistic aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image exhibits characteristics of a mural-like artistic style. The colors are flat and lack the depth typically seen in photorealistic images. The patterns on the man's clothing and the background elements, such as the trees and grasses, are symbolic and stylized rather than realistic. This non-photorealistic aesthetic is consistent with murals that often use simplified forms and bold colors to convey meaning.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Acacia trees in the background are indeed stylized rather than realistic. They have simplified forms with patterned foliage that lacks the detailed texture seen in real trees. This stylization contributes to the overall artistic and symbolic nature of the image.",
