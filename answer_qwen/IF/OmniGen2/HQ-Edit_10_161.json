      "question": "Has the dress been transformed into a mosaic-style design using geometric shapes that resemble African tribal art, while retaining the original pattern layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress retains its original pattern layout with geometric shapes and vibrant colors. The design elements appear to be stylized in a mosaic-like fashion, which is reminiscent of African tribal art. This conclusion is drawn from observing the sharp edges and segmented appearance of the patterns on the dress, combined with the knowledge that mosaic designs often use geometric shapes to create images.",

      "question": "Have the beaded necklace and bracelets been replaced with stained glass tile designs featuring vibrant colors and lead-line-like borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beaded necklace and bracelets in Image B have been transformed into what appears to be stained glass tile designs. The vibrant colors are separated by dark lines resembling lead lines typically found in stained glass artwork. This observation is based on the visual cues of the segmented color blocks and the dark outlines between them, aligning with common characteristics of stained glass art.",

      "question": "Has the background been transformed into a stylized tapestry of warm earth tones, depicting varied African terrains through texture and color blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B has indeed been transformed into a stylized tapestry featuring warm earth tones. It depicts varied terrains through texture and color blending, as seen in the layered and textured appearance of the background. This analysis is supported by the visible gradients and patterns that suggest different landscapes, consistent with artistic representations of African terrains.",

      "question": "Has the hairstyle been transformed into a bas-relief sculpture style, with visible depth, shadow, and sculpted texture, while preserving its original color and structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hairstyle in Image B does not exhibit characteristics of a bas-relief sculpture style. Instead, it maintains its original structure and color but is integrated within the overall mosaic-style transformation of the image. There is no visible depth, shadow, or sculpted texture that would indicate a bas-relief style. Therefore, this conclusion is reached by noting the absence of three-dimensional qualities typically associated with bas-relief sculptures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image in Image B maintains cultural authenticity and visual harmony across all elements. The attire, jewelry, background, and hairstyle are all transformed in a way that respects and reflects African cultural aesthetics, such as the use of vibrant colors, geometric patterns, and earthy tones. The harmony is evident in the cohesive application of the mosaic style throughout the image, ensuring that each element complements the others.",
