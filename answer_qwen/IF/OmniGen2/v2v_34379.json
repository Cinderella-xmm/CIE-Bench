        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the vegetables do not appear to have shrunk, there is no increase in the space between them. The arrangement looks similar to that in Image A, indicating no change in spacing.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roasted vegetables present in Image A have been replaced with a liquid, which is a new element. This indicates that existing elements (roasted vegetables) have been removed and new ones (liquid) have been added.",
