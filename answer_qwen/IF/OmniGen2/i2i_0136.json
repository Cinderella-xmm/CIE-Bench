      "question": "Is the orange depicted as a rubber keychain rather than a natural fruit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange has an additional feature—a metallic ring attached to its stem—which is not typical of a natural fruit. This suggests that it is designed to be used as a keychain. The texture and appearance are consistent with a rubber or plastic material commonly used for keychains, rather than the natural skin of an orange.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the keychain still retain the original stem of the orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B retains a green stem at the top, which is characteristic of oranges. This stem appears to be part of the design of the keychain, maintaining a realistic representation of an orange.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the keychain maintain the glossy texture seen in the original orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B show a glossy texture on the surface of the orange. In Image B, despite being a keychain, the surface maintains a similar reflective quality, suggesting that the glossy texture was preserved in the design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the keychain visually recognizable as a citrus fruit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shape, color, and texture of the object in Image B closely resemble those of a citrus fruit, specifically an orange. These visual cues make it easily identifiable as a citrus fruit even though it is a keychain.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a metallic ring attached to the top of the orange-shaped keychain. This ring serves as an attachment point for keys, confirming that the object is indeed a keychain.",
