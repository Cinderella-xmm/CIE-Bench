      "question": "Has a butterfly been added above the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct visual element resembling a butterfly located directly above the mirror. The shape and coloration are consistent with what one would expect from a butterfly, and its placement is clearly intentional as it stands out against the background. This conclusion is drawn by observing the unique features of the object in question and comparing them to common characteristics of butterflies.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B appears to have a golden hue. This observation is based on the reflective and warm tones that resemble gold, which contrast with the cooler colors of the surrounding environment. The lighting around the mirror enhances this golden appearance, making it visually prominent.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly placed above rather than beside or below the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly is positioned directly above the mirror in Image B. This can be determined by noting its location relative to the circular outline of the mirror and the wall space above it. There is no indication of the butterfly being beside or below the mirror, as those areas remain unoccupied by such an object.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B appears to blend well with the lighting around the mirror due to its golden color, which complements the warm light emanating from the mirror's edge. The lighting enhances the butterfly's visibility while maintaining a harmonious aesthetic with the rest of the scene.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering the modern and minimalist design of the bathroom in Image B, the addition of the golden butterfly adds a touch of elegance without disrupting the clean lines and neutral tones. Its placement and color complement the existing elements, contributing to a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing environment.",
