      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show a sealed container with no visible cracks or openings. The lid appears intact and there are no signs of damage or breakage that would suggest it is cracked open. Based on common sense, a cracked container would display some form of separation or distortion, which is not present here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top surface of the container displays a vivid image of a nebula. This is evident from the swirling patterns and bright colors typical of a cosmic nebula. The design is clearly intentional and artistic, suggesting that this is an edited feature rather than a physical opening revealing the contents.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nebula depicted on the container's top surface in Image B includes shades of red and pink, which can be described as fiery and energetic. These colors are characteristic of certain types of nebulae observed in space photography, where such hues represent various elements and energy emissions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image A, the label features an abstract design with red and orange tones that convey an explosive effect. Comparing this to Image B, the nebula also incorporates red and pink hues. While the specific shades may differ slightly due to artistic interpretation, both share a similar color palette that conveys energy and vibrancy.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nebula is surrounded by small white dots scattered across the dark background, resembling stars. This is a common artistic representation of outer space, where stars are depicted as tiny points of light against the darkness of the cosmos. The presence of these star-like elements enhances the cosmic theme of the nebula.",
