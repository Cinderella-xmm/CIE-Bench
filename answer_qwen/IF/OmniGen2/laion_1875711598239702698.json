      "question": "Has the body of each elephant been transformed into an elegant, curved bottle shape with a defined neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephants' bodies have been reimagined as part of a perfume bottle structure. The lower portion of each elephant forms the base and body of a bottle, while the upper part transitions into a curved neck leading to a cap. This transformation is evident from the smooth, rounded contours that mimic typical bottle designs. The presence of a gold cap further supports this interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the elephant's ears now shaped like gold-trimmed caps positioned at the top of the bottle structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ears in Image B do not resemble caps; instead, they maintain their original form but are integrated into the overall design of the bottle. The caps on the bottles are separate structures located above the elephants' heads, distinct from the ears. Therefore, the ears are not shaped like caps.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the glittering texture on the backs of the elephants been replaced with a glass mosaic pattern composed of small reflective tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backs of the elephants feature a textured area that appears to be made up of small, reflective tiles resembling a glass mosaic. This contrasts with the glittery texture seen in Image A, indicating a deliberate design change to enhance the luxurious appearance of the fragrance packaging.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clearly visible brand logo placed along the trunk of each elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible brand logo on the trunks of the elephants in Image B. Instead, the trunks appear as part of the bottle design without any text or logos present. The focus seems to be on the overall aesthetic rather than branding elements on the trunks.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a minimalist label with a fragrance name visible on the body of each bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a minimalist label on the larger bottle with cursive text that likely represents a fragrance name. This aligns with common practices in high-end fragrance packaging where labels are subtle yet elegant. The smaller bottle does not have a visible label, possibly due to its size constraints.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a cohesive and luxurious aesthetic through its use of rich colors, gold accents, and intricate details. The integration of the elephants into the bottle design, along with the glossy finish and elegant typography, aligns well with the characteristics of premium fragrance packaging. The overall presentation suggests a high-end product.",
