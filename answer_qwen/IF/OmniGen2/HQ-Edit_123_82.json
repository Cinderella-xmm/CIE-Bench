      "question": "Is the woman's figure stylized in a cartoon-like manner with exaggerated proportions or simplified features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's figure appears to have exaggerated proportions and simplified features. Her waist is notably slim, and her dress has a very structured, almost unrealistic silhouette. The overall appearance suggests a stylized, cartoon-like aesthetic rather than a realistic human form. This conclusion is drawn from observing the proportions and the smoothness of the lines which are typical in cartoon illustrations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the red dress in Image B, there are visible gold embroidery details added around the neckline and bodice area. These details are not present in the original image but are clearly seen as embellishments on the dress in the edited version. The presence of these details enhances the dress's visual appeal and gives it a more luxurious look.",

      "question": "Are the butterfly wings significantly larger than they were in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the butterfly wings in Image B with those in Image A, the wings in the edited image appear significantly larger relative to the woman's body. In Image A, the wings seem proportionate to the person, while in Image B, they dominate the frame and extend beyond the borders of the wooden panel, indicating an increase in size.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly wings in Image B feature detailed, intricate textures such as fine veins and layered patterns. These details can be observed by closely inspecting the wings' surface, where individual vein structures and color gradients are evident. Such complexity suggests a high level of artistic detail intended to mimic real butterfly wings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no names of months displayed on the butterfly wings in Image B. Instead, the calendar information is located below the woman's figure, outside the wings. Therefore, it is clear that the wings themselves do not contain any text related to the months.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire composition in Image B is indeed placed on a wooden panel that includes floral inlay patterns. The wooden frame surrounds the central image, and the floral designs are integrated into the corners and sides of the panel, enhancing its decorative quality.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The final image in Image B includes various design elements such as wood grain, floral patterns, and embossed text that suggest it is intended as a collectible item. The combination of these elements creates a vintage or antique feel, which is often associated with collectibles. Additionally, the inclusion of a calendar further supports this idea, as calendars are frequently produced as collectible items.",
