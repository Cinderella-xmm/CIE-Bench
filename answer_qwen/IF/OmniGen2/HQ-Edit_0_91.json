      "question": "Is the figure rendered in a semi-cartoon style with simplified features and stylized lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B appears to have a semi-cartoon style with simplified features and stylized lines. The facial features, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth, are less detailed and more uniform compared to realistic depictions. The lines defining the contours of the face and clothing are bold and consistent, which is characteristic of cartoon-style illustrations. This analysis is based on observing the visual cues in Image B alone.",

      "question": "Are the textile patterns on the robe enhanced with visible gold leaf accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textile patterns on the robe seem to be enhanced with visible gold leaf accents. These accents are noticeable along the edges of the floral designs and other decorative elements on the robe. The use of gold leaf is a common technique in traditional art to add richness and detail, which aligns with the stylized presentation of the image.",

      "question": "Are the hands visibly enlarged compared to their original size in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the hands are visibly enlarged in Image B compared to their original size in Image A, I first analyze the hands in Image B. They appear proportionally larger relative to the rest of the body and the robe's details. Comparing this with Image A, where the hands seem smaller and more naturally proportioned, it is evident that the hands in Image B are indeed enlarged. This conclusion is drawn by comparing the relative sizes and proportions in both images.",

      "question": "Does the image have a deep indigo border framing the entire composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a deep indigo border framing the entire composition. This border is clearly visible around the edges of the image, providing a strong contrast to the lighter tones within the frame. The presence of this border enhances the focus on the central figure and adds a formal, framed appearance to the image.",

      "question": "Are there subtle, hand-drawn floral outlines extending from the robe into the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are subtle, hand-drawn floral outlines extending from the robe into the frame. These outlines are delicate and appear to be part of the artistic design, adding an elegant touch to the overall composition. They are not overly prominent but contribute to the aesthetic appeal of the image. This observation is based solely on the visual cues present in Image B.",
