      "question": "Is the ornate book now represented as a collection of interlocking wooden puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornate book is depicted as a collection of interlocking wooden puzzle pieces. The visual cues include the distinct shapes and separations that resemble puzzle pieces, with some pieces even placed outside the main structure. This design choice transforms the book into a puzzle-like object, which is evident from the gaps and edges between the pieces.",

      "question": "Are the dragon patterns stained with darker wood tones compared to the rest of the puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon patterns in Image B appear to be stained with darker wood tones compared to the rest of the puzzle pieces. This can be observed by noting the contrast in color where the dragons are more pronounced due to their darker shading, making them stand out against the lighter background of the puzzle pieces.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the compass area rendered in lighter wood tones than the dragon patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The compass area in Image B is rendered in lighter wood tones than the dragon patterns. This is discernible by comparing the central circular area (compass) with the surrounding darker-stained dragon designs. The lighter tone helps the compass details to be more visible and distinct.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wood grain texture is clearly visible on the surface of the puzzle pieces in Image B. The natural lines and patterns typical of wood are apparent, adding realism and depth to the image. This detail enhances the perception of the material being actual wood.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All puzzle pieces in Image B have smooth, well-defined edges. Each piece is cleanly separated from the others, with no rough or jagged edges visible. This contributes to the overall polished appearance of the puzzle representation.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
