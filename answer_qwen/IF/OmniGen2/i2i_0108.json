      "question": "Is the character depicted as a 3D half-body figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown from the waist up, which indicates that it is a half-body depiction. The visual cues such as the visible torso and arms, along with the absence of legs below the knees, support this conclusion. Additionally, the lighting and shadows suggest a three-dimensional rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the character appear to be breaking out from a television screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is positioned in front of an old-style television set with its body partially extending beyond the edges of the TV screen. This positioning, combined with the bright light emanating from the screen and the dynamic pose of the character, creates the illusion that the character is emerging or 'breaking out' from the television.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the character in a defensive shield-raising pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is holding the shield in one hand but not in a traditional defensive posture. Instead, the character's stance is more dynamic and aggressive, with one arm raised in a fist and the other holding the shield outward. This suggests an offensive or action-ready pose rather than a defensive one.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image simulate an augmented reality display effect through lighting, shadows, and spatial realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs lighting and shadow effects that give the impression of the character existing in the same space as the physical objects (like the television). The realistic shading on the character and the interaction with the environment contribute to an augmented reality effect, making it seem like the character is part of the real world setting.",

      "question": "Has the character's original appearance and posture been maintained while implementing the new effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the character's costume design and overall appearance remain consistent. However, the posture has changed significantly; in Image B, the character adopts a more dynamic and dramatic pose compared to the more neutral stance in Image A. Thus, while the appearance is maintained, the posture has been altered for the new effects.",
