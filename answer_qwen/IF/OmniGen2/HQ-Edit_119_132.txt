    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the husky has a uniform texture and appearance that is consistent with plush materials rather than live fur. The edges are smooth and lack the natural irregularities found in real animal fur. Additionally, the overall structure and posture of the husky resemble that of a stuffed toy rather than a living animal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The paws of the husky in Image B appear to be oversized relative to the rest of its body, which is a common characteristic of plush toys designed for aesthetic appeal rather than realistic proportions. This exaggeration is not typical of real huskies, whose paws are proportionate to their body size.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The texture of the husky's 'fur' in Image B appears uniformly soft and velvety, lacking the varied strands and depth seen in real fur. This suggests that the texture has been replaced with a fabric-like material commonly used in plush toys.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The eyes and other facial features of the husky in Image B have a stitched or embroidered look, which is typical for plush toys where details are often sewn onto the fabric. Realistic eyes would have more depth and detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is plain and lacks any natural elements such as snow, trees, or sky. It is a simple, neutral backdrop that focuses attention on the plush toy without distraction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
