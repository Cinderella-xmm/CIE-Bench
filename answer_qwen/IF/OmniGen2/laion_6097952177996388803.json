      "question": "Does the edited image depict the mountain range as a mythical beast with identifiable features such as a head, body, or limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B independently, the mountain range does not exhibit features that resemble a mythical beast. The peaks and slopes maintain their natural geological forms without any identifiable head, body, or limbs that would suggest an anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figure. The visual cues such as the rugged terrain, snow patches, and vegetation do not align with characteristics typically associated with a mythical creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the two highest peaks appear as large, curved, horn-like structures emerging from the top of the mythical beast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two highest peaks are prominent but do not appear as curved, horn-like structures. They retain their natural sharp and jagged appearance typical of mountain peaks. There is no visual evidence to suggest they have been edited to resemble horns. Comparing this with Image A, both images show similar peak structures, reinforcing that there has been no transformation into horn-like features.",

      "question": "Are the rocky surfaces of the mountains visibly altered to resemble a textured hide, such as scaly or rugged skin-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rocky surfaces in Image B show natural textures consistent with mountainous terrainâ€”rugged and uneven. There are no patterns resembling scaly or skin-like textures that would suggest a hide. The analysis of Image A reveals similar surface textures, indicating no alteration to mimic a textured hide in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible mossy patterns and root-like structures along the mountain slopes that resemble tangled fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays mossy areas and root-like structures along the slopes, which are natural elements of a mountainous landscape. These features do not resemble tangled fur; instead, they appear as typical vegetation and erosion patterns. Comparing with Image A, these elements remain unchanged, confirming they are natural and not altered for a mythical effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the valleys been transformed into sinewy, muscular structures that follow the natural contours of the land but resemble biological musculature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The valleys in Image B follow the natural contours of the land and do not exhibit characteristics of sinewy, muscular structures. They appear as typical geographical features with no biological musculature resemblance. When compared to Image A, the valleys maintain their natural form, showing no transformation into muscle-like structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible earthy aura surrounding or emanating from the mythical beast, such as warm tones, glowing mist, or ambient light suggesting an organic, natural presence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible earthy aura, warm tones, glowing mist, or ambient light in Image B that suggests an organic, natural presence emanating from a mythical beast. The lighting and colors seem natural and consistent with a typical mountain scene. Comparing with Image A, the lighting conditions and color palette are similar, indicating no added mythical aura in Image B.",
