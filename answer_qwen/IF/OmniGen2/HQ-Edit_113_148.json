      "question": "Is the sandcastle rendered as a translucent crystal sculpture with visible facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle is clearly depicted as a translucent crystal sculpture. The visual cues include the see-through nature of the structure and the visible facets that reflect light, which are characteristic of crystal sculptures. This conclusion is drawn from observing the transparency and the geometric patterns on the surface, which align with common knowledge about crystal structures.",

      "question": "Are there soft blue highlights visible on the surface of the crystal castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows soft blue highlights on the surface of the crystal castle. These highlights suggest illumination from a light source, creating a reflective effect typical of crystal materials. The presence of these highlights enhances the perception of the castle being made of crystal, as crystals often exhibit such reflective properties when lit.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all seashells been replaced with small, polished gemstones in pastel hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seashells have been replaced with small, polished gemstones in pastel hues. This can be inferred from the smooth, shiny appearance of the objects surrounding the base of the crystal castle, which differ significantly from the natural texture and coloration of seashells. The pastel colors and polished finish are consistent with gemstones rather than seashells.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ocean depicted as a wave pattern etched into a frosted glass slab rather than flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ocean in Image B is not depicted as flowing water but rather as a wave pattern etched into a frosted glass slab. This is evident from the static, textured appearance of the background behind the crystal castle, which lacks the fluidity and motion associated with flowing water. Instead, it resembles a decorative element integrated into the display case, suggesting an artistic interpretation rather than a realistic depiction.",

      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a minimalist gallery display case with clean edges and neutral surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the entire scene enclosed within a minimalist gallery display case. The clean edges and neutral surroundings indicate a controlled environment typical of art galleries or museums where objects are displayed for viewing. The lighting and presentation style further support this conclusion, as they are designed to highlight the artwork without distraction.",
