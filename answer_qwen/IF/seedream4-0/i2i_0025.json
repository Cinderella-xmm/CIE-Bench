        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show a consistent artistic treatment across the entire scene, characterized by soft edges, translucent washes of color, visible brushstrokes, and a lack of sharp digital rendering. The background elements such as the tables, chairs, windows, and people are all treated with a similar light, flowing texture typical of watercolor painting. The blending of colors and the way shadows and highlights are diffused further support the interpretation that this is a watercolor-style rendering. Additionally, there are no signs of photographic realism or digital clarity; instead, the image has an organic, painterly quality. Based on these observations, combined with world knowledge about watercolor techniques (e.g., layering washes, transparency, and paper texture), it is clear that the entire image is stylized to resemble a hand-painted watercolor.",

      "question": "Is the foreground woman depicted in greater detail compared to the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground woman is rendered with more defined features, such as clearer facial details, sharper outlines around her hair and clothing, and more nuanced shading on her face and hands. Her expression, jewelry, and the wine glass she holds are more vivid and precisely drawn than the background figures. In contrast, the background individuals are simplified, with less distinct facial features and softer, almost sketch-like linework. This technique is common in artistic compositions where the main subject is emphasized through increased detail and contrast. By comparing the clarity and texture of the foreground woman versus the background, it is evident that she is intentionally rendered with greater detail to draw focus.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the background figures represented with light-colored linework and faint washes rather than detailed rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background figures in Image B are indeed depicted using minimalistic techniques—light outlines, subtle color washes, and limited shading. Their forms are suggested rather than fully realized, with faces lacking detailed expressions and clothing appearing as simple shapes with minimal texture. This approach aligns with watercolor conventions where background elements are often downplayed to emphasize the primary subject. The use of faint washes and thin lines creates a sense of depth and distance, which is consistent with artistic composition principles. Compared to the foreground woman, who is more fully rendered, the background remains impressionistic and understated. This supports the conclusion that they are represented with light-colored linework and faint washes.",

      "question": "Does the woman appear to be elegantly raising her glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman’s posture and hand position suggest a graceful gesture. She holds the wine glass by the stem with her fingers delicately curled around it, a manner typically associated with elegance and refinement in social settings like wine tastings or formal gatherings. Her smile and direct gaze also convey confidence and poise. While the image is stylized, the pose retains natural proportions and balance, reinforcing the perception of elegance. In real-world contexts, holding a wine glass by the stem prevents warming the beverage and is considered proper etiquette—a detail that further supports the idea of an elegant gesture. Thus, despite the artistic style, the visual cues align with the concept of elegance.",

      "question": "Is the composition structured so that the foreground woman is the central point of attention?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of Image B clearly centers on the foreground woman. She is positioned prominently in the lower right quadrant, facing forward and engaging directly with the viewer through eye contact and a warm smile. Her figure is larger and more detailed than any other element in the scene, and she occupies a significant portion of the frame. The background is blurred and simplified, ensuring that visual weight remains on her. Additionally, lighting and color saturation are more pronounced on her, especially in her face and attire, drawing the viewer's eye naturally toward her. These compositional techniques—such as focal placement, detail hierarchy, and contrast—are standard in art to establish a central subject. Therefore, the structure of the image is designed to make her the focal point.",
