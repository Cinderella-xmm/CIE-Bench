      "question": "Is the silhouetted boat and riders replaced by a mythical ocean guardian creature that is clearly distinguishable from a regular boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original silhouetted boat and riders have been replaced by a large, fantastical creature resembling a giant sea snail or conch with limbs and an elaborate shell. This creature is clearly not a regular boat—it has organic, biological features such as a segmented body, tentacle-like appendages, and glowing elements on its back. Its size, shape, and design are inconsistent with any real-world vessel, making it unmistakably a mythical or supernatural entity. The replacement is intentional and visually distinct, indicating a transformation from a mundane object into a fantastical being.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the creature feature a shell-like body composed of sunset-colored hues (orange, red, yellow)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B has a prominent shell-like structure that dominates its upper body. The colors of this shell are richly saturated with warm tones—deep oranges, vibrant reds, and golden yellows—that closely mirror the hues of the sunset sky in the background. These colors are not random but appear to be intentionally coordinated with the ambient lighting, suggesting a thematic integration with the environment. The gradient and luminosity of the shell align with the natural color palette of a sunset, reinforcing the idea that the creature's appearance is inspired by or harmonized with the scene.",

      "question": "Are there coral-like spires visibly extending along the back of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the top of the creature’s shell is adorned with multiple branching structures that resemble coral. These spires are upright, irregular in shape, and extend vertically from the shell's surface. Their texture and form are consistent with marine coral formations, and they are illuminated with a soft glow, enhancing their ethereal quality. These features are clearly visible and serve as a key part of the creature’s design, contributing to its mythological and aquatic aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the riders been replaced with glowing, spirit-like figures that emit light and resemble sea guardians?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Instead of human riders, the creature is topped with several translucent, humanoid figures that emit a bright, radiant light. These figures have flowing forms, long hair, and a ghostly appearance, reminiscent of spirits or divine beings. Their glowing nature contrasts sharply with the dark surroundings, drawing attention to them as symbolic entities. Given their placement atop the creature and their luminous, otherworldly appearance, they strongly resemble mythological sea guardians or nymphs—beings associated with the ocean and nature. This transformation replaces the mundane human element with a supernatural one.",

      "question": "Has the water trail been replaced with glowing, wave-like patterns that match the color gradient of the sunset sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wake behind the creature in Image B is no longer a simple white trail of disturbed water. Instead, it has been transformed into a series of luminous, wave-like patterns that shimmer with blue and cyan hues. While these colors contrast with the warm tones of the sunset, they are not entirely disconnected—their glowing effect creates a magical atmosphere that complements the overall fantasy theme. However, the color gradient of the water trail does not match the sunset sky's orange-red tones; rather, it introduces a new chromatic element (cool blues) that stands out against the warm backdrop. Therefore, while the trail is stylized and glowing, it does not match the sunset’s color gradient.",

      "question": "Is the mythical creature positioned in the same location as the original boat, near the center of the lower half of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the original boat was located in the lower central portion of the frame, moving across the water toward the horizon. In Image B, the mythical creature occupies a nearly identical position—centered horizontally and situated in the lower third of the image, just above the waterline. Despite its larger size and fantastical appearance, it maintains the same spatial relationship to the horizon and surrounding landscape as the original boat did. This suggests that the creature was digitally placed to preserve the composition of the original scene, ensuring visual continuity while introducing surreal elements.",
