      "question": "Does the painting visibly extend beyond its frame to create a 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting features tree branches and foliage that appear to grow out from the frame and extend into the surrounding space. These elements are rendered with realistic textures and shadows, giving the impression that they are physically protruding from the wall. The leaves and branches are not confined within the boundaries of the frame but instead spill over onto the wall surface, creating a three-dimensional illusion. This effect is achieved through careful rendering of depth, lighting, and perspective, which makes it visually convincing that the painted elements have become part of the physical environment. Based on this visual evidence, the painting does indeed extend beyond its frame in a way that creates a 3D effect.",

      "question": "Do the elements from the painting visually merge into the room environment, such as appearing on the wall or floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees and foliage depicted in the painting are not only extending beyond the frame but also appear to be growing directly from the wall, blending seamlessly into the room’s architecture. Specifically, the orange leaves and branches seem to emerge from the corners of the frame and cascade down the wall, suggesting a merging between the artwork and the real-world environment. However, there is no indication that these elements extend onto the floor—only the wall is affected. While the merging occurs on the wall, it does not reach the floor. Therefore, the visual integration is limited to the wall surface and does not include the floor.",

      "question": "Are the transitions between the painting and the room environment smooth without any abrupt edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition between the painting and the room environment in Image B is carefully designed to appear seamless. The extended branches and leaves blend naturally with the wall's surface, and their shadows align with the ambient lighting in the room. The color tones of the foliage match those in the painting, and the shadows cast by the extended elements follow the direction of light coming from the right side of the scene (likely from a window). There are no visible seams or sharp edges where the painted elements meet the wall, indicating a high level of visual coherence. This suggests that the digital editing has been done with attention to detail to ensure smooth integration.",

      "question": "Are the original elements of the painting, such as trees, water, and the sun, still identifiable in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the artistic extension of the painting’s elements into the room, the core components of the original artwork remain clearly visible. The central image still shows a serene river flanked by autumnal trees under a sunset sky, with the sun positioned near the horizon. These key elements—the reflective water, the symmetrical arrangement of trees, and the glowing sun—are preserved and recognizable. The added extensions (the overhanging branches) do not obscure the main composition; rather, they enhance it by creating a sense of continuity between the artwork and the physical space. Thus, the essential features of the original painting are intact and identifiable.",

      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows in the extended portions of the painting match those in the actual room environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears consistent across both the painting and the extended elements. The sunlight enters from the right side, casting diagonal shadows across the sofa and wall, which matches the direction of light falling on the extended branches and leaves. The shadows cast by the overhanging foliage fall naturally on the wall, aligning with the same light source and angle as the rest of the room. Additionally, the brightness and warmth of the light on the extended leaves mirror the glow seen in the painting itself, suggesting that the lighting conditions were carefully matched during the editing process. This consistency in lighting and shadow direction enhances the realism of the 3D effect.",
