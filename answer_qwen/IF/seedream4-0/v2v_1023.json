      "question": "Are the friends depicted as playful, chibi-style 3D characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures inside the snow globe are stylized with exaggerated features such as large heads, simplified facial expressions, and proportionally small bodies—hallmarks of chibi-style animation. These characters are not realistic but instead rendered in a cartoonish, three-dimensional form that aligns with common chibi aesthetics. Their cheerful expressions and rounded shapes further emphasize a playful tone. This visual style is distinct from real-life representations and is often used in animated or toy-like depictions to evoke charm and whimsy. Based on these visual cues and knowledge of character design conventions, it is clear that the friends are portrayed in a chibi-style 3D format.",

      "question": "Are the friends holding game controllers in their hands inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the snow globe, each of the four characters is shown holding a small black object resembling a video game controller. The shape and positioning of these objects match typical handheld gaming devices, with visible buttons and grips. The characters' hands are positioned as if actively using them, consistent with gameplay scenarios. While the scale is miniature due to the snow globe setting, the objects are clearly identifiable as game controllers based on their form and context. This matches the original image's theme of friends playing games, now reimagined in a whimsical, scaled-down version.",

      "question": "Is the snow globe placed on a table in a warm, inviting living room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe rests on a flat wooden surface that appears to be a tabletop, indicated by its texture and the way light reflects off it. The background shows soft, warm lighting, blurred furniture (such as sofas and shelves), and ambient decor like curtains and framed pictures—elements typical of a cozy living room. The overall color palette is rich with amber and orange tones, contributing to a sense of warmth and comfort. These visual elements, combined with general knowledge about interior design and domestic spaces, confirm that the snow globe is situated within a warmly lit, inviting living room environment.",

      "question": "Is there a softly glowing, amber-toned backdrop in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features a gradient of warm colors, primarily shades of orange and amber, which create a glowing effect. This illumination is consistent with indoor lighting, possibly from lamps or sunlight filtering through windows, enhanced by the presence of fairy lights inside the snow globe. The softness of the glow is evident in the lack of harsh shadows and the diffused nature of the light across the scene. This ambiance contributes to a cozy, festive atmosphere, reinforcing the idea of a warmly lit space. Therefore, the backdrop can be accurately described as softly glowing and amber-toned.",

      "question": "Does sunlight stream through the glass, creating delicate sparkles that dance across the surface of the tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual inspection reveals bright highlights and scattered points of light on the tabletop around the base of the snow globe. These appear as star-like sparkles, suggesting light refraction or reflection caused by the transparent glass of the globe. The direction and intensity of these glimmers imply that natural light—likely sunlight—is entering the room from a window, interacting with the glass surface and causing prismatic effects. The sparkle pattern is consistent with how light behaves when passing through curved glass in a sunlit environment. Thus, the presence of sunlight streaming through the glass and producing dancing sparkles is supported by both visual evidence and optical principles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the snow globe, several miniature elements are visible: a small coffee table, chairs, and what appears to be a stool or side table—these represent tiny pieces of furniture scaled down for the diorama. Additionally, white snowflake patterns are etched or suspended within the globe, and a string of glowing fairy lights arches above the characters, emitting a warm, twinkling effect. These decorative elements are typical of holiday-themed snow globes and contribute to the festive, wintry atmosphere. The combination of furniture and seasonal motifs confirms that both types of items are present within the scene.",
