      "question": "Has the person been transformed into a flat illustration-style tennis-themed chibi sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is depicted in a stylized, cartoonish form with exaggerated proportions typical of chibi art—such as a large head relative to the body and simplified facial features. The character is outlined with bold black lines, filled with flat colors (e.g., red dress, white visor), and has a clean, cut-out appearance resembling a sticker. This visual style aligns with common digital stickers used in messaging apps or social media, especially those themed around sports like tennis. The transformation from a realistic photograph to this illustrative format confirms that the person has indeed been converted into a chibi-style sticker.",

      "question": "Is the person depicted in the same original pose as in image A?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the person is standing on a clay court, holding a tennis racket in her right hand, with her left hand raised near her face in a gesture that may indicate celebration or focus. In Image B, the chibi version shows the character in a different stance—both hands gripping the racket, ready to swing, and facing slightly forward. The posture is more dynamic and action-oriented compared to the relaxed, mid-motion pose in Image A. Therefore, the pose has changed significantly; it is not the same as the original. This change is consistent with artistic reinterpretation in sticker design, where poses are often adjusted for clarity and expressiveness.",

      "question": "Does the chibi sticker retain a red dress and a white hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character in Image B is wearing a red sleeveless dress, which matches the color of the original outfit seen in Image A (a coral-orange dress). Although the exact shade may differ slightly due to stylization, the red tone is preserved. Additionally, the character wears a white visor, corresponding to the white sun visor worn by the person in Image A. These elements are clearly retained in the sticker version, even though they are simplified and rendered in flat colors. Thus, the core clothing elements are preserved in the transformation.",

      "question": "Is the tennis racket simplified into a black-lined filled shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis racket is depicted with a thick black outline and a solid fill pattern inside the strings, which is characteristic of simplified vector illustrations. Unlike the detailed, textured racket in Image A, this version uses minimal shading and geometric shapes to represent the frame and netting. The handle is also stylized with simple lines and no texture. This simplification into a bold, black-lined, filled shape is consistent with the chibi sticker aesthetic, where realism is sacrificed for clarity and visual appeal.",

      "question": "Are all three matching sticker elements—a tennis ball, a victory V-sign hand, and red clay court lines—generated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are additional sticker elements surrounding the main character: a yellow tennis ball with a white outline, two separate hand stickers making a 'V' sign (victory gesture), and a partial checkerboard-patterned object resembling a tennis court line or shadow. However, the 'red clay court lines' are not explicitly generated as standalone sticker elements; instead, the background remains the actual photo of the clay court, not a sticker. While the tennis ball and V-sign hands are present as distinct stickers, the court lines are part of the underlying image, not a separate sticker. Therefore, not all three elements are generated as independent stickers.",

      "question": "Do all stickers have white borders and transparent backgrounds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each sticker element in Image B—including the chibi character, the tennis ball, the V-sign hands, and the partially visible checkered shape—is outlined with a white border and appears to be layered over the background without any opaque fill behind them. This indicates a transparent background, typical of PNG-style stickers used in digital applications. The white border adds a 'cut-out' effect, enhancing the sticker-like appearance. Since all these elements share this design trait, it can be concluded that they all have white borders and transparent backgrounds.",
