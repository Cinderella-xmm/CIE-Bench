      "question": "Has the individual been transformed into a stylized figurine with a chibi aesthetic, featuring a large head and simplified proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B exhibits characteristics typical of a chibi-style design, which is a Japanese art style often used in anime and collectible figurines. The head is disproportionately large compared to the body, a hallmark of chibi aesthetics. Facial features such as the large, round eyes and small mouth are exaggerated for cuteness. The limbs are short and simplified, and the overall form lacks detailed anatomical realism, further supporting the chibi interpretation. This contrasts sharply with realistic human proportions seen in traditional portraiture.",

      "question": "Does the dress exhibit a smooth, glossy porcelain-like surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the dress in Image B has a high sheen and reflective quality, consistent with glazed porcelain or ceramic materials commonly used in collectible figurines. Light reflects uniformly across the surface, indicating a non-porous, polished finish. There are no visible fabric textures, wrinkles, or matte areas that would suggest textile material. This glossy appearance is characteristic of manufactured collectibles designed to mimic porcelain.",

      "question": "Are the primary colors of the dress vivid green and deep red, with visible gold accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B prominently features a bright, vivid green bodice paired with deep red sleeves and shoulder accents. Gold trim is clearly visible along the edges of the dress, including the neckline, waistline, and hem, adding ornamental detail. These color choices are consistent with Renaissance-inspired fashion motifs but rendered in bold, saturated tones typical of stylized modern interpretations. The combination of green, red, and gold creates a rich, decorative effect.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a miniature lamb positioned in the figurine’s lap with visibly exaggerated, fluffy wool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine holds a small lamb in its lap. The lamb's wool is depicted with pronounced, rounded tufts that give it a highly textured and exaggeratedly fluffy appearance. This stylization emphasizes softness and cuteness, aligning with the overall chibi aesthetic. The wool is not rendered realistically but rather in a way that enhances visual appeal through volume and uniformity, suggesting deliberate artistic exaggeration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figurine positioned on an elegant base that visually replicates a renaissance-style painting backdrop, including landscape and architectural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine rests on a circular base adorned with ornate gold detailing and dark wood-like coloring, resembling a classical pedestal. Behind the figurine, the background includes painted columns, balustrades, and a pastoral landscape with mountains and sky—elements typical of Renaissance-era paintings. This backdrop appears to be part of a diorama or painted scene designed to evoke a historical setting, enhancing the figurine’s thematic presentation. The integration of architectural details like Corinthian columns and fresco-style panels further supports the Renaissance aesthetic.",
