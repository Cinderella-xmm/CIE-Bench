        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sports car is shown from multiple angles. The top-left portion of the image displays a side profile of the car, while the bottom-left shows another side view from the opposite direction. The rightmost part of the image presents a top-down view. However, there is no explicit front-facing view of the car in this composite image. The front of the car is not directly visible in any of the three views provided; instead, the side and top perspectives dominate. Based on visual analysis, the front view (facing directly toward the viewer) is missing. This conclusion is supported by world knowledge that a front view would show the grille, headlights, and bumper directly, which are not fully visible here.",

      "question": "Does the edited image contain the side view of the sports car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes two distinct side views of the sports car. The top-left section shows the left side of the vehicle, with the driver's door, wheel, and rear quarter clearly visible. The bottom-left section shows the right side of the same car, providing a mirrored perspective. Both views are typical representations of side profiles used in automotive design presentations. These views are consistent with standard industry practices for showcasing vehicles from lateral angles. Therefore, based on visual cues and common automotive rendering conventions, the image does contain side views.",

      "question": "Does the edited image contain the top view of the sports car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rightmost panel in Image B clearly depicts the car from a bird’s-eye perspective, showing the roof, windshield, and overall silhouette of the vehicle from above. This is a standard top-down view commonly used in technical illustrations or marketing materials to display the car's proportions and roofline. The presence of the Mustang emblem on the windshield and the symmetry of the body panels confirm that this is indeed a top view. This aligns with world knowledge about multi-angle car renderings, where such overhead shots are included for comprehensive visualization.",

      "question": "Are the front, side, and top views visibly combined into a single image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B combines three different views—two side views and one top view—into a single composite layout. However, it does not include a front view. While the image is composed of multiple perspectives arranged together, the absence of a direct front-facing view means that the 'front' component of the requested combination is missing. The arrangement is professional and clear, but the set of views is incomplete as per the question’s criteria. Thus, although the side and top views are present, the full trio (front, side, top) is not represented.",

      "question": "Is the combined image clear, appropriately scaled, and presented professionally for the specified uses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is visually clean, with high resolution, consistent lighting, and sharp details across all three views. The car is rendered without distortion, and each perspective is proportionally accurate and well-aligned. The white background enhances clarity and focus on the vehicle, which is typical in professional automotive design presentations. The scaling is uniform across views, allowing for easy comparison. Such presentation style is commonly used in catalogs, digital portfolios, or engineering documentation. Therefore, based on visual quality and industry standards, the image is professionally presented and suitable for its intended use.",
