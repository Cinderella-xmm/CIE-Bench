      "question": "Is the black dog depicted in a chibi-style with exaggerated, cute features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black dog is illustrated in a simplified cartoon style, but it does not exhibit typical chibi characteristics such as oversized eyes, large head relative to body, or other exaggerated proportions. Instead, the dog maintains a more realistic silhouette and proportion, albeit stylized. Chibi art typically emphasizes cuteness through disproportionate features, which are absent here. Therefore, based on visual analysis and common understanding of chibi style, the dog is not rendered in a chibi style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag rendered in a minimalist flat design without gradients or 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The objects in Image B — the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag — are drawn using solid colors with minimal shading and no visible gradients or depth cues like shadows or highlights that suggest 3D form. The lines are clean and uniform, and there is no attempt at realism or texture. This aligns with a minimalist flat design aesthetic commonly used in digital illustrations and icons. Thus, these elements are indeed rendered in a flat, two-dimensional style without 3D effects.",

      "question": "Is the black dog the most prominent element in the illustration, with its distinct characteristics preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black dog is centrally positioned beneath the bench and occupies a significant portion of the lower half of the illustration. Its dark color contrasts with the lighter background and surrounding elements, drawing visual attention. While the bench and other items are also clearly defined, the dog’s size, placement, and contrast make it the focal point. Moreover, key characteristics such as its shape, posture (lying down), and breed-like features (e.g., floppy ears, short snout) are preserved despite the simplification. Therefore, the dog remains the most prominent and recognizable element.",

      "question": "Does the illustration incorporate a bold white outline around its perimeter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the edges of the entire image, there is a clear, thick white border that defines the outer edge of the illustration. This outline is consistent and appears to be intentionally added to give the image a sticker-like appearance. Such outlines are common in digital stickers or clipart to enhance visibility against various backgrounds. The presence of this white stroke around the entire perimeter confirms that the illustration includes a bold white outline.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dog and bench extend slightly beyond the circular frame of the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration has a rounded, irregular boundary resembling a sticker cutout, not a perfect circle. However, upon close inspection, both the dog and the bench are fully contained within the outlined shape. There is no part of either object that protrudes outside the perimeter. The design ensures all elements fit neatly inside the boundary, even though the shape is organic. Therefore, neither the dog nor the bench extends beyond the frame.",

      "question": "Is the background of the illustration transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background behind the illustration is shown as a checkerboard pattern, which is a standard visual representation of transparency in digital graphics (commonly seen in PNG files). This indicates that the actual background of the image is transparent, allowing it to be placed over any surface without a solid backdrop. Since the checkerboard pattern is present and the illustration itself has no filled background, we can conclude that the background is transparent.",
