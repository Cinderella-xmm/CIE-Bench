        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character (Pikachu) is fully visible from head to feet. The entire body is present, including both arms, legs, and tail. There is no truncation or cropping that would suggest a half-body form. Based on visual cues, Pikachu is depicted in full, standing upright with all limbs extended. This is consistent with typical full-body illustrations of animated characters in promotional or interactive media. Therefore, it is not a half-body depiction.",

      "question": "Does the character appear to be jumping out of a children’s tablet screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu is positioned above a tablet device, with its feet hovering just above the screen. Visual effects such as glowing light rays emanating from the screen and a smaller version of Pikachu displayed on the screen suggest that the character is emerging from the digital interface. This effect is commonly used in marketing materials for interactive apps or games to simulate augmented reality or immersive experiences. The tablet itself has a design resembling a child-friendly device—colorful buttons and a bright display—further supporting the idea that it is targeted at children. Thus, the visual composition strongly implies that Pikachu is 'jumping out' of the screen.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu’s arms are raised upward and outward, forming an open, expansive posture. This body language is universally recognized as a welcoming or joyful gesture, often used in animation to convey excitement or friendliness. Combined with Pikachu’s wide smile and open mouth, the pose reinforces a sense of enthusiasm and invitation. This aligns with common design choices in children’s media to create engaging and approachable characters. Hence, the arms are indeed positioned in a welcoming manner.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B combines multiple elements to create an illusion of interactivity: Pikachu appears to leap from a tablet screen, with visual effects like light beams and a dynamic pose suggesting motion. The tablet displays a game-like environment featuring Pikachu and a Poké Ball, indicating a playful, interactive application. Such imagery is typical of marketing for interactive children’s apps or games, where characters seem to break the fourth wall by emerging from screens. These techniques are designed to evoke engagement and excitement, simulating a real-time interaction experience. Therefore, the depiction effectively simulates an interactive entertainment effect.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tablet has visibly rounded corners, which is a common safety feature in children’s devices to prevent injury. Additionally, the tablet includes red accents on the sides, likely representing buttons or protective grips, which adds to its colorful and child-friendly aesthetic. The screen content also features bright colors, cartoonish graphics, and familiar characters like Pikachu and a Poké Ball—elements typical of children’s entertainment software. These design choices collectively indicate that the tablet is styled to appeal to young users, aligning with standard features of children’s tablets.",
