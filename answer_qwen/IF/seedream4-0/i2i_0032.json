      "question": "Have all five ingredients—banana, chocolate chips, butter, eggs, and flour—been converted into chibi-style illustration stickers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements include a banana with a smiling face, a chocolate chip cookie (representing chocolate chips), a block of butter with arms and legs, two eggs (one brown, one white) with faces and limbs, and a container of flour with a cheerful expression. Each of these corresponds to one of the five listed ingredients: banana, chocolate chips (as part of a cookie), butter, eggs (two are shown, which is typical for recipes), and flour. All are stylized in a chibi-like cartoon form with facial features and limbs, consistent with sticker design. The presence of two eggs may reflect common recipe usage rather than an error. Thus, all five ingredients are represented in chibi-style illustrations.",

      "question": "Does each chibi-style sticker of the ingredients include both an expression and an action?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing each sticker in Image B: the banana has a smiling face (expression) but no clear action; the chocolate chip cookie has a smile and blushing cheeks (expression), but no visible action; the butter has a smile and is making a peace sign (both expression and action); the brown egg has a smile and raised arms (expression and action); the white egg has a smile and one arm raised (expression and action); the flour container has a wide smile and open mouth (expression) and one arm raised (action). While most have both expression and action, the banana and chocolate chip cookie lack any distinct action beyond their facial expressions. Therefore, not every sticker includes both an expression and an action.",

      "question": "Do the chibi-style illustration stickers exhibit cute design traits suitable for decorating a recipe notebook?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers in Image B feature large eyes, simple smiles, rosy cheeks, and exaggerated proportions typical of kawaii or chibi art styles. These elements are widely recognized as 'cute' and commonly used in children's media and stationery products. The playful poses (e.g., peace signs, waving) enhance their charm. Such designs are often used in recipe notebooks, planners, or food-related crafts to add whimsy and personalization. Given these characteristics, the stickers are clearly designed with cuteness in mind and would be appropriate for decorative purposes in a recipe notebook.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are examples of the required expressions and actions (like butter doing a peace sign, banana winking) present in their respective chibi-style illustrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butter character is clearly depicted making a peace sign with one hand, which matches the described action. The banana has a closed-eye smile with a slight tilt, suggesting a wink, which aligns with the description. The other ingredients also show expressive features and gestures: the eggs have arms raised, the flour container appears joyful, and the cookie has a happy face. Although the banana’s wink is subtle, it is visually implied by the eye shape and angle. Since both the butter’s peace sign and banana’s winking are present, even if the latter is stylized, the key examples mentioned are indeed illustrated.",

      "question": "Do the chibi-style stickers maintain a cohesive and decorative style appropriate for a recipe notebook?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All stickers in Image B share a consistent artistic style: rounded shapes, thick outlines, white borders resembling stickers, and uniform color palettes. They use similar facial features (large eyes, small mouths, blush marks) and anthropomorphic limbs. This consistency creates a cohesive visual theme. Additionally, their playful and friendly appearance makes them suitable for decorative use in contexts like recipe notebooks, where fun and engagement are desired. The overall aesthetic is aligned with popular trends in food-themed stationery and digital stickers.",
