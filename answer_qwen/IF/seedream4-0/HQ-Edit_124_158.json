      "question": "Is the cat and surrounding elements contained within a transparent or framed shadow box structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene is enclosed by a visible wooden frame with a light-colored border, which appears to be part of a miniature diorama or shadow box. The edges are clearly defined, and the depth of the scene suggests it is viewed from the front, as if through a glass panel. This type of framing is characteristic of a shadow box display, often used for showcasing detailed miniatures. The consistent lighting and lack of shadows extending beyond the frame further support the conclusion that this is a contained, framed structure. The presence of such a frame is not typical in natural environments but is common in artistic dioramas or staged scenes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible elements of a 3D-rendered vintage theatre, such as a stage, proscenium, or theatrical lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features several elements indicative of a vintage theatre setting. There is a prominent proscenium arch formed by the red velvet curtains and golden trim, which frames the central scene like a stage. The backdrop includes columns and a throne-like chair, suggesting a stage setup. Additionally, the overall composition resembles a theatrical performance space, with a clear separation between the 'stage' and the foreground. While there is no explicit theatrical lighting visible (such as spotlights), the dramatic illumination and shadows suggest artificial lighting typical of a stage environment. The combination of these elements strongly supports the interpretation of a vintage theatre scene.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the red settee been transformed into a throne-like structure with regal features such as raised back, golden embellishments, or crown motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red settee in Image B has been significantly altered from its original form. It now features ornate golden detailing along the armrests, legs, and backrest, including scrollwork and decorative patterns reminiscent of royal furniture. The backrest is taller and more elaborate, with a crown-like finial at the top, reinforcing the throne-like appearance. These modifications, combined with the elevated position of the cat, indicate a transformation into a regal seat. The use of gold accents and symmetrical design elements aligns with traditional representations of thrones in royal settings.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there deep red or dark velvet curtains visible on both sides of the scene, framing the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, deep red velvet curtains are clearly visible on both the left and right sides of the scene. They are draped elegantly and tied back with golden tassels, creating a formal entrance to the central area where the cat sits. The texture and color of the fabric match the description of rich velvet, commonly used in theatrical or royal settings. These curtains serve as a visual frame, enhancing the sense of a staged or ceremonial environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, golden columns positioned around the edges of the scene, matching the scale of a miniature diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows four golden columns—two on each side of the stage area—positioned symmetrically. These columns are proportionally small relative to the cat and the throne, indicating they are part of a miniature setting. Their classical design, with fluted shafts and ornate capitals, matches the style of ancient Greek or Roman architecture, commonly used in theatrical or royal dioramas. The uniformity and placement suggest they are structural elements of a scaled-down environment, consistent with a miniature diorama.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small framed portraits of mice hanging within the scene, displayed as if part of a royal gallery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, three framed portraits are suspended from the ceiling above the cat. Each frame contains an image of a mouse, depicted in a stylized manner. The frames are oval and ornate, resembling those found in royal galleries or historical collections. The positioning of these portraits—centered and evenly spaced—suggests intentional display, akin to a curated art collection. The inclusion of mice in such a regal context adds a whimsical or satirical element, possibly alluding to the cat's dominance over its prey.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the cat appear as a dominant, elevated figure within the scene, surrounded by elements that suggest royal authority (e.g., throne, portraits, gilded details)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat in Image B is centrally positioned on a throne-like chair, elevated above the ground level. It wears a golden collar adorned with jewels, reinforcing its status. The surrounding elements—including the red velvet curtains, golden columns, framed mouse portraits, and ornate furniture—all contribute to a royal atmosphere. The cat's posture is relaxed yet commanding, and its gaze is direct and unchallenged. These visual cues collectively establish the cat as a dominant, sovereign figure within a carefully constructed narrative of power and hierarchy.",
