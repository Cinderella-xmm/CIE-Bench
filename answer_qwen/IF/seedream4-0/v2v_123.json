      "question": "Are the individuals depicted as chibi-style 3D models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B exhibit exaggerated proportions typical of chibi art style—large heads, small bodies, and simplified facial features such as large eyes and minimal detailing. Their smooth, rounded forms and stylized rendering suggest a 3D model aesthetic commonly used in animated or toy-like character designs. The overall visual language aligns with chibi-style representations seen in anime, video games, and collectible figurines. This is further supported by the lack of realistic anatomical details and the presence of soft shadows and highlights consistent with 3D rendering techniques.",

      "question": "Is the character with blonde hair wearing glowing armor engraved with runes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character with blonde hair in Image B is clearly wearing detailed armor that features glowing golden symbols resembling runes. These symbols are illuminated, suggesting magical or enchanted properties, which is common in fantasy-themed designs. The armor itself has a metallic appearance with intricate patterns and inscriptions, reinforcing the idea of rune-engraved gear. This matches typical fantasy tropes where warriors wear enchanted armor for protection or power amplification.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character holding the orb in Image B is wearing simple, earth-toned attire consisting of a tunic, pants, and boots. There are no elaborate decorations or magical elements on their clothing, distinguishing them from the more ornate outfits of the other characters. This minimalist design is characteristic of an adventurer’s outfit—practical and unassuming, suitable for travel or exploration. The lack of flashy accessories or armor supports the interpretation of 'plain adventurer's clothing'.",

      "question": "Does the archer have leather armor and a floral crown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The archer in Image B is equipped with brown leather-like armor covering the torso, arms, and legs, consistent with typical leather armor used in fantasy settings. Additionally, they wear a floral crown adorned with pink roses and green leaves, which is clearly visible atop their head. This combination of practical combat gear and decorative headwear suggests a blend of warrior and nature-connected themes, often associated with forest guardians or elven archers in fantasy lore.",

      "question": "Is the background a photorealistic depiction of a lush oasis with palm trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the background in Image B features palm trees, a sandy shore, and a body of water, it does not appear to be photorealistic. Instead, the environment has a stylized, slightly cartoonish quality with soft lighting and simplified textures. The colors are vibrant but not naturalistic, and the rendering lacks the fine detail and depth typical of high-resolution photography. This suggests a digitally created, artistic interpretation rather than a photorealistic one.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the image is framed by an ornate, intricately designed border featuring swirling patterns and colorful embellishments. This decorative frame surrounds the entire scene, giving it the appearance of a painting or collectible artwork. Such borders are often used in illustrated books, trading cards, or digital art to enhance the presentation and give a sense of completion or formality to the composition.",
