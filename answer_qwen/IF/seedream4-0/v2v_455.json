      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, each sticker is set against a checkered pattern (alternating light and dark gray squares), which is a standard visual indicator in digital design software to represent transparency. This pattern is commonly used to denote that the background behind the sticker is transparent, allowing it to be placed over various backgrounds without a solid backdrop. The absence of any visible background color or texture within the sticker boundaries further supports this interpretation. Therefore, based on common digital design conventions and visual cues, the background of each sticker is transparent.",

      "question": "Are the stickers arranged in a 3x3 layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are nine distinct sticker images arranged in a grid format. Counting the rows and columns: there are three rows and three columns, forming a 3x3 arrangement. Each sticker occupies one cell in this grid, with consistent spacing between them. This structured layout confirms that the stickers are indeed organized in a 3x3 configuration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining each sticker in Image B, they appear to be uniformly sized and shaped. The borders of each sticker are clearly defined as squares, with equal width and height. The content within each sticker (such as characters and scenes) is proportionally scaled to fit within these square frames. There is no visual distortion or elongation that would suggest a non-square aspect ratio. Therefore, based on the consistent geometry of the frames and their content, all stickers maintain a square 1:1 aspect ratio.",

      "question": "Do the stickers exhibit a Chibi Ghibli cartoon aesthetic with bright, vibrant colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character designs in Image B feature exaggerated proportions typical of 'Chibi' style—large heads, small bodies, and expressive faces—which aligns with Japanese anime aesthetics. Additionally, the presence of Totoro, a well-known character from Studio Ghibli's film 'My Neighbor Totoro,' strongly indicates a Ghibli-inspired theme. The color palette includes bright, saturated hues such as orange jackets, blue skies, and vivid snowboards, contributing to a vibrant and cheerful tone. These visual elements collectively reflect a Chibi Ghibli cartoon aesthetic with bright, vibrant colors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing each sticker individually: some show the character actively snowboarding in different poses (e.g., crouched, mid-air, leaning), others depict emotions like excitement or surprise, and one shows the character building a snowball. Additionally, one sticker features Totoro interacting with the snow, providing a unique scenario. Each sticker presents a different dynamic or context, indicating variety in actions, expressions, and situations. This diversity ensures that no two stickers repeat the same scene or emotion, confirming that each portrays a distinct moment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In each sticker, the main character (or Totoro) is fully visible. For example, in all human character stickers, limbs, head, torso, and clothing are present and intact. Even in dynamic poses (like falling or snowboarding), no body parts are cut off or missing. The only exception might be minor details like fingers or toes due to motion blur or artistic simplification, but overall, the figures are complete. Totoro is also fully depicted in both appearances. Thus, based on visual inspection, all character depictions are complete.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each sticker in Image B has a consistent white border surrounding the artwork. This outline appears to be of equal thickness across all stickers and separates the illustration from the transparent background. It enhances visibility and gives a sticker-like appearance. The uniformity in line weight and color (white) suggests intentional design consistency. No sticker deviates from this pattern, confirming that all have a uniform white outline.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Looking closely at the edges and surrounding areas of each sticker, there are no stray lines, misplaced objects, or unconnected elements beyond the intended design. All content is contained within the defined borders of each sticker, and the white outline cleanly frames the illustrations. The background is transparent and free of artifacts. This indicates that the design is clean and cohesive, with no extraneous or disjointed components.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Scanning each sticker in Image B, there are no visible words, letters, or written symbols. While some stickers include labels or icons (like snowflakes or mountains), none contain readable text. The focus remains purely on imagery—characters, actions, and scenery—without any textual overlays or captions. Therefore, based on careful visual inspection, there is no text present in any of the stickers.",
