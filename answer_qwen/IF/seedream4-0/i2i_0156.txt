    "Question": "Q1: Do the book pages extend out of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the book is open and positioned diagonally on a wooden surface. The pages appear to be spread outward, particularly on the right side, where the edge of the page extends beyond the visible boundary of the image. This suggests that the pages do indeed extend out of the frame. The visual cue of the page's edge disappearing off the right side of the image supports this conclusion. Based on common photographic framing and perspective, when an object’s edge is not fully contained within the image, it implies extension beyond the frame.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a subtle curved shadow on the extended pages?",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the extended right-hand page casts a soft, curved shadow along its lower edge, especially noticeable against the wooden background. This shadow follows the natural curvature of the page as it bends slightly outward due to the book’s open position. Such shadows are typical in real-world lighting conditions when a physical object like a book page curves away from the light source. The shadow is faint but discernible, consistent with ambient lighting and the three-dimensional form of the page.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the editing convey the impression that the book is unfolding toward the viewer?",
    "explanation": "The perspective and angle of the book in Image B suggest a forward motion or unfolding effect. The right page appears to lift slightly and curve outward, creating a sense of depth and movement toward the viewer. This effect is enhanced by the lighting and shadowing, which emphasize the three-dimensionality of the page. While the book is static, the visual cues—such as the upward tilt of the page and the way the light falls across it—create an illusion of dynamic unfolding. This impression is likely intentional in the editing to give a sense of narrative or progression.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the extended pages visually consistent with the original book pages?",
    "explanation": "The extended pages in Image B maintain the same color, texture, and typography as the rest of the book’s pages. The paper tone is uniform, and the printed text continues seamlessly without any visible breaks or distortions. There are no signs of digital artifacts, such as pixelation or mismatched edges, that would suggest inconsistency. The alignment of the text lines and margins also matches the original pages, indicating that the extended portion is a continuation of the book’s design. This consistency suggests careful editing to preserve realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a seamless transition between the original and extended parts of the book pages?",
    "explanation": "The transition between the original and extended portions of the book pages in Image B appears smooth and uninterrupted. There are no visible seams, sharp edges, or abrupt changes in texture, color, or lighting that would indicate a digital splice. The curvature of the page and the gradual shift in lighting contribute to a natural appearance. In addition, the shadow and highlights flow continuously across the page, reinforcing the illusion of a single, continuous surface. This seamless integration suggests high-quality editing aimed at maintaining photorealism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
