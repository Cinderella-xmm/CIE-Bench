      "question": "Is the ballerina depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated proportions and a significantly larger or more voluminous tutu than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina is rendered in a stylized, cartoon-like illustration. The proportions of her body are slightly exaggerated compared to realistic human anatomy—such as elongated limbs and a simplified facial structure—which is typical of cartoon or anime-style art. Her tutu is notably larger and more layered than in realistic depictions, with multiple ruffled tiers that create a fan-like silhouette, giving it a more dramatic and whimsical appearance. This contrasts with the more naturalistic and less exaggerated tutu in Image A, which appears closer to real-world ballet costumes. The visual cues in Image B, such as clean outlines, flat color application, and stylized details, confirm the cartoon aesthetic. Therefore, based on these observations and common knowledge about cartoon art styles, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Is the background of the image composed of soft pastel shades such as light pink, lavender, or mint green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a soft, muted palette dominated by light pink tones, particularly around the edges and corners of the image. These hues blend into lighter whites and pale peach shades, creating a gentle, dreamy atmosphere. While there are no strong lavender or mint green elements, the overall color scheme aligns closely with the definition of soft pastel shades. The use of these colors contributes to the delicate and romantic aesthetic often associated with children's illustrations or greeting cards. Based on this visual analysis and understanding of color theory and design conventions, the background can be classified as composed of soft pastel shades.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible glitter accents (such as sparkling dots or shimmering patterns) added to the ballerina’s costume?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the ballerina’s tutu and bodice feature small, star-shaped sparkles and shimmering lines along the edges of the layers. These elements are clearly designed to resemble glitter or sequins, commonly used in illustrated versions of ballet costumes to enhance their magical or festive appearance. These accents are not present in the same form in Image A, where the embellishments appear more subtle and realistic. In Image B, the glitter effects are intentional artistic additions, likely meant to evoke a sense of enchantment typical in animated or stylized depictions. Thus, based on the visual evidence and knowledge of illustrative techniques, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Are there clearly designated blank areas on the image suitable for adding written messages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes two large, rectangular white spaces positioned symmetrically behind the ballerina—one on the upper left and one on the upper right. These areas are intentionally left unadorned and are framed by floral decorations, suggesting they are placeholders for text. Such design choices are common in greeting cards, invitations, or digital templates where users are expected to add personal messages. The presence of these blank regions, combined with their central positioning and contrast against the rest of the image, indicates they are meant for textual content. Therefore, based on both visual layout and common design practices, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Are there floral motifs (such as flowers or leaves) present along the borders of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, Image B features decorative floral motifs arranged along all four corners of the frame. These include stylized flowers in shades of pink and white, accompanied by green leaves and stems. These elements form a border-like pattern that enhances the overall aesthetic and complements the theme of elegance and delicacy associated with ballet. The placement and repetition of these floral designs suggest they are intentional decorative elements, consistent with traditional card or illustration framing techniques. This observation is supported by world knowledge of graphic design, where such borders are used to frame content and add visual appeal. Hence, the presence of floral motifs is confirmed.",
