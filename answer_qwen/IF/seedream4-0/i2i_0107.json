      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B exhibits key characteristics of chibi art style, which is a form of Japanese anime and manga design that features exaggeratedly large heads, small bodies, and simplified facial features. The figure has a disproportionately large head compared to its body, oversized round eyes, and a simplified expression with minimal detailing—hallmarks of chibi design. Additionally, the overall proportions and stylized appearance align with common chibi depictions of characters from popular franchises like Harry Potter. This visual analysis, combined with world knowledge about chibi art conventions, confirms that the character is indeed designed in a chibi style.",

      "question": "Does the chibi character wear a scarf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is clearly depicted wearing a red and yellow striped scarf around its neck. This accessory is consistent with the iconic Gryffindor house colors from the Harry Potter series, which are often associated with scarves worn by students at Hogwarts. The scarf is visibly draped over the shoulders and chest area, matching the typical representation of a student’s winter attire in the franchise. Based on visual cues and familiarity with the character's canonical wardrobe, it is evident that the character wears a scarf.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character in Image B is shown holding a brown wand in its right hand. The wand is slender, pointed, and ends with a small orange tip, resembling the magical wands used by wizards in the Harry Potter universe. This detail is consistent with the character's identity as a wizard and reflects the typical portrayal of Harry Potter carrying his wand. The presence of the wand, along with its positioning in the character's hand, is clearly visible and supports the conclusion that the character is holding a wand.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi character placed within the open palm of a human hand. The size of the character relative to the hand indicates it is a small figurine or keychain, and it fits comfortably in the palm. The fingers are positioned around the character, suggesting it is being held or displayed. This context, combined with the visible scale and placement, confirms that the character is indeed shown in the palm of a hand.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B displays a surface with a distinct wood grain pattern, including visible lines and natural color variations typical of wooden materials. The texture and coloration suggest a wooden table or desk, commonly used as a neutral backdrop for product photography. This visual evidence, supported by general knowledge about material textures and photographic setups, confirms that the background is made of wood.",
