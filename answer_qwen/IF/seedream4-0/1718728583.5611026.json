      "question": "Does the robot feature streamlined, symmetrical forms with chrome or highly reflective metallic surfaces typical of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B exhibits a highly polished, chrome-like surface that reflects light in a way consistent with metallic finishes. Its body features clean, vertical lines and symmetrical patterns, especially noticeable in the torso and limbs, which are characteristic of Art Deco design principles—emphasizing symmetry, geometric shapes, and luxurious materials. The sleek, elongated form of the robot, along with its structured, segmented joints and smooth contours, aligns closely with Art Deco aesthetics seen in mid-20th-century industrial design and futuristic art. This is further supported by the use of reflective surfaces and stylized, linear detailing that evoke a sense of elegance and modernity.",

      "question": "Are the flamingos depicted as stylized geometric patterns rather than realistic birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flamingos are clearly rendered using low-poly, geometric modeling techniques. Their bodies are composed of flat, angular facets, forming triangular and polygonal shapes instead of smooth, organic curves. This stylization transforms them into abstract representations that resemble origami or digital sculptures. Unlike natural flamingos, which have soft feathers and curved necks, these birds lack anatomical realism and instead emphasize sharp edges and simplified forms. This approach is common in modern digital art and 3D modeling to create a retro-futuristic or minimalist aesthetic.",

      "question": "Do the palm trees in the background have angular, geometric forms instead of natural, curved shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm trees in the background of Image B appear to be stylized with sharp, angular silhouettes and blocky, faceted trunks and fronds. Rather than displaying the natural, flowing curves typical of real palm trees, they follow a geometric pattern consistent with the overall artistic style of the scene. These trees resemble abstract interpretations, possibly inspired by low-poly or digital art styles, where natural forms are reduced to simplified, polygonal shapes. This contrasts with the more organic appearance one would expect in a realistic depiction.",

      "question": "Are the rocks in the background rendered with stylized, geometric shapes rather than natural rock formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rocks in the background of Image B are not depicted as natural, irregularly shaped boulders. Instead, they are composed of sharp, angular planes and facets, forming geometric structures that resemble crystalline or polyhedral forms. These shapes are inconsistent with typical geological formations, which usually have rounded edges and weathered textures. The deliberate use of flat surfaces and precise angles suggests an intentional stylistic choice to integrate the environment into the same futuristic, low-poly aesthetic seen in the flamingos and robot. This indicates a stylized, non-naturalistic rendering.",

      "question": "Is the entire scene rendered in a muted pastel color palette, avoiding strong or vibrant hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B employs a soft, warm color scheme dominated by pinks, light blues, and sandy tones. While the colors are generally subdued and harmonious, there are still notable elements of vibrancy—such as the bright orange-tinted sunglasses on the robot and the reflective chrome surfaces that catch light vividly. However, the overall atmosphere leans toward a pastel aesthetic, particularly in the sky, water, and flamingos, which are rendered in gentle, blended hues. Although some highlights are bright due to reflections, the dominant tone remains soft and pastel-like, suggesting a deliberate choice to maintain a dreamy, surreal ambiance without overwhelming contrast or saturation.",

      "question": "Is the robot positioned centrally among the flamingos, maintaining the original compositional layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B is indeed positioned at the center of the frame, surrounded by flamingos on both sides. This central placement mirrors the composition seen in Image A, where the robot also occupies the focal point. The surrounding flamingos are arranged symmetrically around the robot, reinforcing its prominence. Despite changes in style (e.g., geometric styling), the spatial arrangement and visual hierarchy remain consistent. The robot stands upright and forward-facing, drawing the viewer’s attention directly, just as it does in the original image. Therefore, the compositional layout has been preserved, even though the artistic execution differs.",
