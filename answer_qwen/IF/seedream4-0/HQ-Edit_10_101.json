      "question": "Is the surface of the image rendered with a visible textured canvas effect, such as fabric-like weave or uneven surface detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the surface exhibits a distinct texture that mimics a woven canvas or textile material. This is evident in the subtle irregularities and grain-like patterns across the entire image, particularly noticeable in the background wallpaper and the frame edges. The texture appears consistent with traditional oil painting on canvas, where the weave of the canvas subtly shows through the paint layers. This is not a smooth digital rendering but one that simulates physical media, giving it a tactile quality. This visual cue aligns with artistic styles that aim to emulate classical paintings, where canvas texture enhances realism and depth.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the knit patterns on the cardigan visibly exaggerated, with enhanced depth, contrast, or stitch definition compared to normal knitting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knit patterns on the cardigan in Image B are highly detailed and appear more pronounced than typical real-world knitting. The cable-knit design features deep shadows and sharp highlights, emphasizing each twist and loop. The contrast between the raised stitches and recessed areas is amplified, creating a three-dimensional effect that goes beyond natural knitting textures. This exaggeration suggests artistic enhancement, likely for stylistic or dramatic effect, common in painted or digitally stylized portraits. Such rendering makes the fabric appear almost sculptural, indicating intentional emphasis on texture rather than realistic representation.",

      "question": "Do the buttons on the cardigan exhibit metallic sheen or reflective qualities, such as highlights, shine, or a non-matte finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buttons on the cardigan in Image B show clear signs of reflectivity. They have bright specular highlights and a smooth, glossy surface that suggests a metallic or polished material. These reflections are consistent with light interacting with a non-matte, possibly brass or silver-toned surface. In contrast to matte plastic or fabric-covered buttons, these display a defined circular highlight, which is characteristic of shiny materials. This level of reflectivity is not typical of standard clothing buttons but is often used in artistic renderings to add visual interest and suggest luxury or craftsmanship.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall color palette of the image use soft, warm tones (such as muted golds, creams, or earthy browns) rather than cool or neutral colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B leans heavily toward warm, earthy tones. The cardigan is a rich brown with golden undertones, the sweater underneath is a deep teal but balanced by surrounding warmth, and the background features soft beige, cream, and muted pink floral patterns. Even the lighting casts a warm glow, enhancing the golden hues. This contrasts with cooler tones like blues or grays, which are subdued. The overall impression is one of coziness and warmth, typical of traditional portrait art using warm palettes to evoke comfort and timelessness. Therefore, the dominant colors are indeed soft and warm.",

      "question": "Is there visible detailed embroidery or decorative stitching along the edges of the frame surrounding the portrait?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frames behind the man are intricately designed with visible decorative elements. Along their borders, there are repeating floral motifs and embroidered-style patterns, including small flowers and leaves in red, blue, and green threads. These details resemble hand-embroidered tapestries or needlework, suggesting a crafted, ornamental quality. The texture within the frame's border is not flat but shows variation in thickness and color, consistent with stitched embroidery. This detail is not just painted but appears to be part of the fabric's surface, reinforcing the idea of decorative stitching.",

      "question": "Is the man’s face, hair, glasses, and general posture clearly preserved and unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the man’s facial features—including his gray hair, beard, round glasses, and gentle smile—are nearly identical in structure and expression. His posture, with the head slightly tilted and shoulders relaxed, remains consistent. However, while the core identity is preserved, there are subtle differences due to artistic stylization in Image B: skin texture is smoother, lighting is warmer, and details like the eyes and glasses have been enhanced for painterly effect. Nevertheless, the fundamental appearance—face, hair, glasses, and pose—is clearly maintained. Thus, despite stylistic changes, the essential elements are preserved and unchanged in form.",
