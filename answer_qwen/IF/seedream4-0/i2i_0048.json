        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) exhibits significantly higher contrast compared to typical natural zebra imagery. The black and white stripes of the zebra appear more vivid and sharply defined, with pronounced highlights and deep shadows, especially noticeable on the zebra's body where light reflects off a metallic-like surface. This suggests that the contrast has been artificially increased beyond natural levels. Additionally, the background—particularly the grass and sky—shows heightened differentiation between light and dark areas, further indicating contrast enhancement. Such an effect is common in digital editing to make subjects stand out more dramatically.",

      "question": "Is there visible improvement in the sharpness of zebras and the grassy ground in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sharpness of both the zebras and the grassy ground appears enhanced in Image B. The edges of the zebra’s stripes are crisp and well-defined, almost unnaturally so, suggesting digital sharpening or post-processing effects. Similarly, individual blades of grass and textures in the terrain are clearly visible, which goes beyond typical photographic clarity for such scenes. However, this sharpness is inconsistent with natural biological textures—the zebra’s skin appears reflective and smooth, resembling metal rather than fur. This indicates artificial enhancement rather than natural sharpness. Therefore, while sharpness is visibly improved, it is not due to realistic detail but rather digital manipulation.",

      "question": "Are the natural textures of the zebras' stripes and the grassland detailed and clear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the image displays high visual clarity, the textures of the zebras’ stripes do not reflect natural fur patterns. Instead, the stripes have a glossy, metallic sheen, reflecting light in a way that mimics polished chrome or stainless steel. This suggests the zebra is either a sculpture or digitally altered to appear artificial. Natural zebra fur would show subtle variations in texture, softness, and slight imperfections in stripe alignment—none of which are present here. While the grassland appears detailed, its texture seems consistent with real vegetation. However, the zebra’s unnatural material undermines the authenticity of the overall scene. Thus, while some details are clear, they are not natural.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are faint silhouettes of tall buildings visible in the distant background, forming a skyline that suggests an urban environment. These structures are not present in natural savanna landscapes and appear to be digitally inserted or composited into the scene. Their presence juxtaposes the wild setting with a cityscape, creating a surreal blend of nature and urban life. This kind of element is often used in conceptual or artistic photography to evoke themes of urban encroachment or modernity meeting wilderness. No vehicles or people are visible, but the inclusion of a city skyline qualifies as an urban element being added for aesthetic or symbolic purposes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the basic layout of two zebras standing in a grassy field remains similar to what might be seen in a natural setting, the composition has been fundamentally altered. The foreground now includes a large, metallic platform or structure that was not present in the original scene. This addition disrupts the natural flow of the landscape and introduces an artificial element that changes the viewer’s perspective and context. Furthermore, the zebra itself appears to be made of metal, indicating a transformation from living animals to sculptures or digital constructs. These modifications mean that although the spatial arrangement of the zebras is retained, their nature and surrounding environment have been changed significantly. Therefore, the original composition has not been preserved.",
