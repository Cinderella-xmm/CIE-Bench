      "question": "Is the hiking boot replaced with a finely carved wooden sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object visually resembles a hiking boot in shape and structure but is entirely composed of wood. The material has a distinct grain pattern, coloration, and texture consistent with carved wood rather than leather or synthetic materials. The laces, eyelets, and overall form are sculpted from wood, indicating that this is not a real boot but a detailed wooden replica. This conclusion is supported by the uniformity of the wood grain across all surfaces and the absence of any signs of stitching, fabric, or rubber soles typical of actual footwear. Therefore, it is evident that the original hiking boot has been replaced with a finely carved wooden sculpture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the detailed panels and lacing of the original boot preserved in the wooden sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden sculpture in Image B closely mimics the design elements of a hiking boot. The panels on the side, including the curved cutouts and structural lines, are clearly defined and replicated in wood. The lacing system, complete with loops and eyelets, is also present and intricately carved to resemble the original boot's design. These details suggest that the artist carefully preserved the functional and aesthetic features of the original boot in the sculpture. While they are made of wood instead of leather and metal, their shapes and placements are faithful to the original, indicating preservation of detail.",

      "question": "Are light and dark wood tones used to replicate the original leather texture and sole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the wooden sculpture, there is a variation in wood tones—lighter areas on the upper parts of the boot and darker tones on the toe cap and sole regions. This contrast mimics the typical color scheme of a leather hiking boot, where darker sections often represent reinforced areas like the toe and heel. The use of different shades of wood enhances the three-dimensional effect and gives the illusion of depth and texture similar to leather. Additionally, the darker tone on the sole replicates the appearance of a rubber outsole, suggesting intentional artistic choice to emulate the original boot’s materials through tonal variation in wood.",

      "question": "Is the wooden sculpture positioned on a minimalist wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden sculpture is placed on a flat, clean-edged wooden surface that extends horizontally from a wall. The shelf appears simple in design, with no ornate detailing, supporting the description of 'minimalist.' The background is neutral and uncluttered, further emphasizing the simplicity of the setting. The material of the shelf matches the natural wood aesthetic of the sculpture, reinforcing the idea of a curated display space. Based on these visual cues—clean lines, lack of decoration, and integration with the sculpture—the shelf can be accurately described as minimalist.",

      "question": "Are subtle grain patterns visible on the surface of the wooden sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the wooden sculpture displays clear and natural wood grain patterns, particularly noticeable on the sides and top of the boot. These grains run in various directions, consistent with how wood naturally grows and is shaped. The grain adds texture and authenticity to the piece, distinguishing it from a painted or synthetic imitation. The lighting in the image highlights these patterns, making them visible even in fine detail. Such grain visibility is characteristic of high-quality woodworking and contributes to the realism of the sculpture.",

      "question": "Does the wooden sculpture maintain the robust form of the original hiking boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden sculpture retains the full silhouette and structural integrity of a hiking boot, including its high ankle support, thick sole, and overall sturdy build. Despite being made of wood, the proportions, curvature, and thickness of the boot are consistent with those of a real hiking boot designed for rugged terrain. The carving captures the robustness intended for outdoor use, even though it is now an artistic object. This fidelity in form suggests that the artist prioritized maintaining the original boot’s functional appearance, ensuring the sculpture still conveys strength and durability.",
