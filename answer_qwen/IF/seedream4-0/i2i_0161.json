      "question": "Is there a large title saying “Catch the Wave” placed above the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large white text reading 'Catch the Wave,' is clearly visible at the top of the image. It is positioned above the horizon line, which separates the sky from the ocean. The text spans a significant portion of the width of the image and is centered horizontally. Based on visual inspection, this text is indeed located above the horizon, as the horizon appears just below the text and aligns with the waterline in the background. This placement is consistent with typical design practices for promotional or thematic overlays, where titles are placed in unobstructed areas of the sky to ensure visibility.",

      "question": "Is there a note in the bottom-left corner that reads “Summer Adventures – 2025”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small text element is visible in the bottom-left corner. Upon close inspection, the text reads 'Summer Adventures – 2025.' This is consistent with common graphic design practices where additional information such as event names or years are placed discreetly in corners. The font is smaller than the main title but legible. The positioning and content match the description exactly, confirming its presence.",

      "question": "Is the title “Catch the Wave” visibly larger compared to other elements in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title 'Catch the Wave,' is rendered in a large, bold, sans-serif font that dominates the upper portion of the image. When compared to other textual elements—such as the smaller 'Summer Adventures – 2025' note in the bottom-left corner—the title is significantly larger in size and more prominent. Additionally, it occupies a central and elevated position, drawing immediate attention. In visual hierarchy terms, this makes it the most dominant text element, indicating intentional design emphasis. Therefore, it is visibly larger than all other text in the image.",

      "question": "Is the title “Catch the Wave” positioned above the visible horizon line in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horizon line in the image is defined by the meeting point of the sky and the ocean surface. The text 'Catch the Wave,' is placed directly above this line, with no overlap into the ocean or beach area. The sky background behind the text confirms its placement above the horizon. This positioning ensures the text does not obstruct key visual elements like the surfers or waves while maintaining visibility. Thus, based on spatial analysis, the title is indeed positioned above the horizon.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in the bottom-left corner of Image B reads 'Summer Adventures – 2025.' The year '2025' is clearly visible and separated by an en dash from the preceding phrase. This formatting is standard for event or campaign annotations. The inclusion of a specific year suggests a forward-looking theme, possibly for a future summer event. The presence of '2025' is confirmed through direct visual inspection and matches the expected format.",
