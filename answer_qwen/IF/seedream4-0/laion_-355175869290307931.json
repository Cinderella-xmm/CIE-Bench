      "question": "Is the edited image presented as a flat postcard format rather than a 3D product shot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag is depicted as a two-dimensional illustration on a white sheet of paper, which is placed inside a black frame or portfolio. The rendering lacks depth and shadows that would suggest a three-dimensional object. Instead, it resembles a printed image or drawing, consistent with a flat postcard format. Unlike Image A, which shows a realistic 3D product shot with visible texture and dimensionality, Image B presents the bag in a stylized, flattened manner. This suggests it is not a photograph but an artistic representation meant to be viewed as a flat image, such as a postcard.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the main features of the bag rendered in minimalist line art style with clean, simplified outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bag in Image B is illustrated using clear, thin lines to define its shape and structure. Details like the handles, zippers, and stitching are represented with minimal detail and no shading or complex textures. The chevron pattern is indicated by simple parallel lines without depth or variation in tone. Compared to Image A, where the bag has rich texture, volume, and realistic material rendering, Image B uses a much simpler visual language—relying on outlines and flat color fills. This aligns with a minimalist line art style, focusing on form over realism.",

      "question": "Is the chevron pattern visually enhanced to appear raised or embossed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chevron pattern is drawn with uniform lines and lacks any shadowing, gradient, or textural depth that would suggest a raised or embossed effect. It appears flat and consistent with the rest of the surface. In contrast, Image A shows the chevron pattern with subtle depth due to lighting and fabric texture, giving it a more tactile appearance. However, in Image B, the design is purely illustrative and does not simulate physical elevation. Therefore, there is no visual enhancement to make the pattern appear embossed.",

      "question": "Are the gold zippers depicted with a raised or embossed effect, distinct from the surrounding surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The zippers in Image B are rendered as thin, straight lines with slight color differentiation (gold) from the olive background, but they lack any shading, highlights, or contouring that would indicate a raised or embossed quality. They are integrated into the flat illustration without depth cues. In Image A, the zippers have metallic sheen and reflect light, suggesting physical presence and dimensionality. In Image B, however, all elements—including the zippers—are part of the same flat plane, indicating no embossing or dimensional rendering.",

      "question": "Is the entire image rendered in a muted olive tone palette without vibrant or contrasting colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B primarily uses a muted olive green for the bag, with gold accents for the zippers and hardware. These colors are consistent with the original bag’s color scheme, but the overall palette is subdued, lacking bright or saturated hues. The background is white, and the frame is black, which provides contrast but does not introduce vibrant tones. The illustration avoids strong color contrasts or vivid shades, maintaining a calm, understated aesthetic. Thus, the image adheres to a muted olive tone palette with minimal vibrancy.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image include a blank area on the back of the postcard suitable for writing messages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows only the front side of the postcard, featuring the illustration of the bag. There is no visible indication of the reverse side or any space designated for writing. While postcards typically have a blank back for messages, this specific image does not show that portion. Based solely on what is visible, we cannot confirm the presence of a writable area. Therefore, while it's plausible that the postcard has a blank back, the image itself does not provide evidence of it.",

      "question": "Is the postcard displayed inside a sleek black portfolio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the postcard placed within a rectangular black frame or case that has a glossy finish and clean edges, resembling a portfolio or presentation box. The way the postcard is positioned—with a slight lift at the bottom edge and a visible inner lining—suggests it is housed in a structured container. This black casing functions similarly to a sleek portfolio, designed to present the artwork professionally. The materials and design imply a premium display method, consistent with a high-end portfolio.",

      "question": "Are the interior pages of the portfolio ivory in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the black portfolio, the visible backing or matting behind the postcard appears to be a creamy off-white or ivory color. This is evident from the border surrounding the white postcard, which has a warm, slightly yellowish tone typical of ivory paper. This choice of color complements the muted olive tones of the bag illustration and enhances its visual appeal. Given the visible layer beneath the postcard, it is reasonable to conclude that the interior pages or matting are indeed ivory-colored.",
