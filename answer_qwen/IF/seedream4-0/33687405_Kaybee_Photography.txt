    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The woman’s attire in the edited image retains the vibrant colors and intricate beadwork seen in traditional African garments. Her clothing features bold patterns, including red, blue, yellow, and green threads, with detailed embroidery and tassels. The rendering style appears semi-realistic—preserving realistic textures and lighting while slightly stylizing certain elements (e.g., smoother skin tones, enhanced contrast) to fit the aesthetic of a collectible card. This aligns with common artistic approaches in digital collectibles where realism is balanced with illustrative clarity.",

These labels are clearly legible and correctly positioned beneath the character image. The values and names match exactly with the question's description, confirming their presence and correct labeling.",
