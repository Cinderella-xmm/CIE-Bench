      "question": "Is the central body of the drone redesigned to resemble a robotic face with sharp, angular features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central body of the drone is clearly stylized to resemble a robotic face. The design includes prominent angular shapes, glowing yellow eyes, and a symmetrical structure that mimics facial features such as a nose and mouth area. These elements are not typical of standard drones but are characteristic of anthropomorphic or robotic designs in sci-fi aesthetics. The sharp angles and aggressive styling suggest a deliberate transformation into a more sentient or menacing appearance, aligning with common depictions of robotic characters in futuristic media.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the rotor blades replaced with arm-like structures that appear to be capable of rotation and are positioned as if in motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rotor blades have been replaced with mechanical arm-like structures extending from the drone’s body. These limbs are segmented, jointed, and equipped with what appear to be wheels or grippers at their ends, suggesting mobility and functionality beyond simple flight. Their positioning—angled outward and slightly bent—implies dynamic movement, consistent with limbs in action. This contrasts with traditional rotor blades, which are fixed and purely aerodynamic. The visual cues indicate these are not static parts but functional appendages designed for interaction or combat.",

      "question": "Are the original landing gears replaced with multiple spider-like mechanical legs extending from the drone’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the drone equipped with six articulated mechanical legs extending downward from its body, resembling those of a spider. These legs are jointed, segmented, and terminate in small wheels or pads, allowing for both walking and balance. Unlike the simple, rigid landing gear seen in typical quadcopters, these legs suggest enhanced mobility on varied terrain. This transformation from passive landing supports to active locomotive limbs is a significant redesign, emphasizing a shift from aerial-only operation to multi-modal movement.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the character shown in mid-flight above a detailed futuristic cityscape with high-rise buildings and advanced urban elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B depicts a highly detailed futuristic cityscape. It features towering skyscrapers with sleek, reflective surfaces, illuminated windows, and advanced architectural designs. There are also elevated transport systems and glowing pathways, indicative of a technologically advanced urban environment. The drone is positioned centrally in the air, hovering above this city, which reinforces the impression of mid-flight. This setting is consistent with science fiction depictions of future cities, often used to convey themes of technology and progress.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character exhibit a sleek metallic surface with reflective textures, chrome finishes, or glowing highlights indicating a metallic aura?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drone in Image B has a highly polished, dark metallic surface with visible reflections and chrome-like finishes, especially noticeable on its limbs and body panels. Blue and yellow glowing accents highlight key areas such as the eyes, joints, and edges, giving it a dynamic, high-tech appearance. These glowing elements suggest internal energy sources or advanced systems, reinforcing the idea of a sophisticated mechanical entity. The overall aesthetic aligns with common portrayals of futuristic robots or drones in media, where metallic sheen and luminous details signify advanced technology.",

      "question": "Is there a speech bubble present with the text “Secure the Quantum Core!” written in a bold, tech-style font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A speech bubble is clearly visible in the upper right portion of Image B. It contains the text “Secure the Quantum Core!” in a bold, stylized font with orange and white colors and a digital, futuristic design. The font style includes sharp edges and glowing outlines, typical of sci-fi or cyber-themed graphics. The placement and design of the speech bubble suggest it is part of a narrative or mission objective, adding dramatic context to the drone's presence in the scene.",
