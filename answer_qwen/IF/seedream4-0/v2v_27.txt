    "Question": "Q1: Does the wombat in the stickers have overly large, expressive eyes and gentle facial features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each of the six sticker versions of the wombat displays large, round eyes that are proportionally larger than typical animal depictions, which is a common stylistic choice in kawaii or cute cartoon illustrations to enhance expressiveness. These eyes are paired with soft, rounded facial features such as small smiles, rosy cheeks, and minimal sharp lines, contributing to a gentle and endearing appearance. This design aligns with popular trends in character design for stickers and digital avatars, where exaggerated eyes and soft features are used to evoke warmth and charm. The consistent use of these traits across all poses supports the conclusion that the wombat has been stylized with overly large, expressive eyes and gentle facial features.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are all six distinct poses correctly depicted in the stickers?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains six individual stickers arranged in a 3x2 grid. Each sticker shows the wombat in a unique pose: (1) making peace signs with both hands, (2) crying with hearts, (3) arms outstretched in a welcoming gesture, (4) sleeping on its side, (5) pointing to the side with sparkles, and (6) blushing with hearts around it. Each pose is clearly differentiated in terms of body language, expression, and accompanying visual elements (e.g., tears, hearts, sparkles). There is no repetition or ambiguity in the poses, and each one conveys a distinct emotion or action. Therefore, all six poses are distinct and correctly depicted.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the wombat wearing a fun Hawaiian shirt and straw hat similar to those in the reference image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wombat is consistently dressed in a light teal Hawaiian-style shirt adorned with white floral patterns and orange polka dots, which matches the tropical aesthetic seen in Image A. Additionally, the wombat wears a straw-colored fedora with a dark band, identical in style to the hat in Image A. This consistency in attire across both images confirms that the clothing in the stickers is indeed a fun, tropical-themed outfit matching the reference image. The design choices—such as the shirt’s pattern and the hat’s shape—are characteristic of vacation or beachwear, reinforcing the theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the stickers include bright tropical tones with hibiscus flowers, palm fronds, or fruity drink designs in the background?",
    "explanation": "Each sticker in Image B incorporates tropical elements in the background or surrounding area. For example, hibiscus flowers appear in multiple stickers (especially in the top-left and bottom-middle ones), palm fronds are visible behind some characters, and a cocktail with an umbrella is present next to the first sticker. These elements are rendered in bright, cheerful colors like orange, green, and pink, contributing to a vibrant tropical atmosphere. While not every sticker includes all three elements, they collectively feature a mix of hibiscus, palm fronds, and fruity drinks, consistent with a tropical theme. This aligns with common design practices for themed stickers, where environmental cues reinforce the mood.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the stickers designed with a dimension ratio of 9:16?",
    "explanation": "The stickers in Image B are presented in a vertical rectangular format, but their exact aspect ratio cannot be determined solely from visual inspection without precise measurements. However, based on standard sticker design conventions and digital asset formats, many mobile stickers (especially for messaging apps) are often created in a 9:16 ratio to fit smartphone screens vertically. That said, the image shows the stickers as square-shaped with rounded corners, which suggests a more uniform or square-like aspect ratio rather than a tall, narrow 9:16 format. Upon close observation, the stickers appear to be closer to a 1:1 or slightly taller-than-wide ratio, not 9:16. Therefore, unless explicitly stated or measured, the assumption that they follow a 9:16 ratio is not supported by visual evidence.",
    "answer": "No"
