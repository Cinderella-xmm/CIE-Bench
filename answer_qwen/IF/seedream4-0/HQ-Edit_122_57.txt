    "Question": "Q1: Is the vase now composed of clear, faceted crystal material that mimics the original shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is clearly made of a transparent, crystalline material with visible facets and reflections, characteristic of cut crystal. The light refracts through its surface, creating prismatic effects typical of high-quality crystal glassware. This contrasts sharply with opaque or painted ceramic materials. Despite the change in material, the overall silhouette and structural form—such as the rounded body, neck, handles, and foot—are preserved, indicating it mimics the original shape. Therefore, based on visual cues like transparency, refraction, and geometric cutting patterns, the material is indeed clear, faceted crystal.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the decorative panels on the vase replaced with etched abstract floral patterns in crystal, rather than painted figures or scenes?",
    "explanation": "The decorative panels on the vase in Image B show intricate, deeply carved designs that are embedded into the crystal surface. These include stylized floral motifs and what appears to be an etched figure resembling a classical female form, consistent with the original painted figure but now rendered in relief within the crystal. However, these are not abstract patterns—they retain representational elements such as human figures and identifiable flowers. While they are etched rather than painted, they are not abstract; they maintain symbolic and figurative detail. Thus, the replacement is not with abstract patterns but with detailed, figurative etchings.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Have all the flowers been replaced with pastel-colored, translucent, intricately carved crystal blossoms?",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the bouquet consists entirely of flower-like structures that are transparent or semi-transparent, with soft pastel hues (pinks, blues, purples) and internal crystalline textures. Each petal exhibits fine detailing and facets, suggesting they are crafted from crystal or a similar material. Unlike natural flowers, which have organic textures and color gradients, these appear uniformly smooth and structured, consistent with hand-carved crystal artistry. There are no signs of organic plant matter—no stems, leaves, or natural decay. All elements in the bouquet are consistent with being sculpted crystal blossoms, matching the description exactly.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the vase placed on a minimalist, flat, reflective mirrored pedestal that shows a clear reflection of the vase and flowers?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vase rests on a sleek, rectangular base that has a highly reflective surface, mirroring the lower portion of the vase and some of the surrounding crystal flowers. The reflection is sharp and symmetrical, indicating a polished mirror-like finish. The pedestal itself is simple in design—flat, geometric, and unadorned—consistent with a minimalist aesthetic. This contrasts with the ornate wooden table seen in Image A. The presence of a clear, undistorted reflection confirms the use of a reflective surface, supporting the conclusion that it is a mirrored pedestal.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the crystal vase maintain the same overall shape, size, and structural features (such as handles and foot) as the original ornate vase?",
    "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the crystal vase retains the same fundamental structure: a wide body, narrow neck, two ornamental handles, and a defined foot. The proportions appear identical, and the placement of decorative elements (like the central figure panel and side motifs) aligns spatially with the original. Although the material and decoration method differ (etched vs. painted), the silhouette and architectural features are preserved. This indicates that while the medium has changed, the design blueprint remains faithful to the original, confirming that shape, size, and structural features are maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
