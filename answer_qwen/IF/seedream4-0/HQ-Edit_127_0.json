      "question": "Is the title \"The Nocturnal Observer's Guide\" clearly displayed on the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'The Nocturnal Observer's Guide.' is prominently displayed at the top of the image in a large, elegant serif font. It is positioned centrally and stands out against the dark blue background, making it highly legible. The repetition of the title in a decorative text box at the bottom further reinforces its presence. Based on visual cues such as font size, placement, and contrast with the background, it is clear that the title is intended to be a focal point and is indeed clearly displayed.",

      "question": "Does the tree and surrounding foliage display lush, highly detailed botanical features consistent with a scientific illustration style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a tree branch with deeply textured bark and surrounding leaves that are rendered with high precision and detail. The leaves are depicted with visible veins, natural curvature, and realistic shading, suggesting careful attention to botanical accuracy. This level of detail aligns with the style of scientific illustrations, which emphasize anatomical and structural fidelity. The overall composition, including the arrangement of branches and leaves, appears deliberate and informative, reinforcing the scientific aesthetic. Compared to typical artistic renderings, this image prioritizes realism and detail, characteristic of educational or scientific visual guides.",

      "question": "Are the colors in the image dominated by earthy tones, particularly highlighting the owl’s brown and cream plumage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette of Image B is predominantly composed of earthy tones such as browns, tans, and deep greens, which complement the natural setting. The owl itself has a richly detailed plumage featuring shades of brown, cream, and white, which stand out against the darker background. These colors are consistent with the natural coloring of many owl species, especially those adapted to forested environments. The use of warm, muted hues enhances the nocturnal and naturalistic theme, while the moon and sky provide a contrasting cool tone that balances the composition. Thus, the emphasis on earthy tones is both visually dominant and thematically appropriate.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible labels pointing to and identifying the owl’s talons and feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several labeled lines extend from the owl to specific anatomical features. Notably, one label points directly to the owl’s talons, identifying them as 'Peregrine Talons' (though this may be an error in labeling—peregrine refers to falcons, not owls). Other labels point to parts of the owl’s body, including 'Feathers,' 'Streaked Plumage,' and 'Slate-Gray Wings.' These annotations suggest an educational intent, with clear demarcation of physical traits. While the terminology may not be entirely accurate, the presence of labels for both talons and feathers is evident. Therefore, based on visual evidence, these features are indeed labeled.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the moon depicted as a dotted diagram with labeled lunar phases (e.g., waxing gibbous, full moon)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moon in Image B is shown as a circular diagram with dashed lines dividing it into sections, resembling a schematic representation rather than a realistic full moon. Various points on the moon are marked with small dots and connected to labels such as 'Crisium,' 'Mare Imbrium,' and 'Oceanus Procellarum,' which are actual lunar features. However, there are no explicit labels indicating lunar phases like 'waxing gibbous' or 'full moon.' Instead, the diagram appears to represent major lunar maria and craters, suggesting a focus on geography rather than phase cycles. Therefore, while it is a diagrammatic moon, it does not depict lunar phases.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a text box located at the bottom of the image containing a short, descriptive paragraph about owl nocturnal adaptations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of Image B, there is a rectangular text box with a decorative border containing a paragraph titled 'The Nocturnal Observer's Guide.' The text discusses the owl’s nocturnal habits, mentioning adaptations such as large eyes, silent flight, and acute hearing. Although some of the text appears distorted or garbled (possibly due to rendering issues), the content clearly focuses on explaining how owls are adapted to nighttime hunting. This matches the description of a short, informative paragraph about nocturnal adaptations. Given the layout and thematic consistency, the presence of such a text box is confirmed.",
