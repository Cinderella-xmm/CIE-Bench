    "Question": "Q1: Is the cow depicted in a stylized 3D chibi art style?",
    "explanation": "The cow in Image B exhibits exaggerated proportions typical of chibi art style—such as a large head relative to its body, oversized eyes, and simplified features. The smooth, rounded surfaces and cartoonish facial expression (with rosy cheeks and a wide smile) are consistent with 3D chibi animation commonly seen in modern digital art and anime-inspired designs. These stylistic choices, combined with the lack of realistic anatomical details and textures, indicate that the cow is rendered in a stylized 3D chibi art style. This contrasts with realistic depictions, which would show more natural proportions and detailed skin texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the cow retain its original black-and-white coat patterns?",
    "explanation": "The cow in Image B still has patches of black on a white base, maintaining the classic Holstein-like coloration. Although the pattern is simplified and stylized compared to a real cow, the core black-and-white contrast remains intact. This indicates that while the design is not photorealistic, it preserves the essential color scheme of a traditional dairy cow. The artistic simplification does not eliminate the fundamental black-and-white pattern but adapts it to fit the chibi aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the cow leaning against the vintage television with both front hooves placed atop the screen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cow's front hooves are clearly positioned on top of the vintage television set, resting on the frame above the screen. Its posture suggests it is leaning forward slightly, with its weight supported by these hooves. The television is placed upright in the grass, and the cow’s body is angled toward it, indicating interaction. This positioning aligns precisely with the description of leaning against the TV with both front hooves on top of the screen.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the cow sport a mischievous grin?",
    "explanation": "The cow in Image B displays a wide, open-mouthed smile with visible teeth and a bright red tongue, along with raised eyebrows that suggest playfulness or cheekiness. In character design, such facial expressions are often used to convey humor or mischief. Combined with the overall cartoonish and animated look, this grin can reasonably be interpreted as mischievous rather than neutral or sad. The expression is exaggerated for comedic effect, typical of chibi characters meant to evoke charm or humor.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the scene set in a grassy field with a bright sky and a few 3D-modeled clouds?",
    "explanation": "The background of Image B shows a vibrant green grassy field under a clear blue sky. The clouds present are fluffy, uniformly shaped, and have a soft, smooth appearance characteristic of 3D modeling rather than natural cloud formations. Their uniformity and idealized shapes suggest they were digitally created, likely using 3D rendering software. The lighting is bright and even, reinforcing the impression of a sunny day. Together, these elements confirm that the scene is set in a stylized grassy field with a bright sky and 3D-modeled clouds.",
    "answer": "Yes"
