      "question": "Has the Eiffel Tower been replaced with a bottle-shaped object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure that was originally the Eiffel Tower in Image A is now replaced by a large, transparent bottle-like object. The bottle is positioned exactly where the Eiffel Tower would be, dominating the skyline and aligning with the perspective of the surrounding cityscape. This replacement is clearly visible as the iconic lattice framework of the Eiffel Tower is now embedded within the glass of the bottle, suggesting it has been 'contained' or 'replicated' inside the bottle. Given that the original Eiffel Tower is no longer present and has been substituted with this bottle-shaped object, the conclusion is that the Eiffel Tower has indeed been replaced.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the structure have a transparent or glass-like appearance with embossed lattice patterns resembling the Eiffel Tower's framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The structure in Image B exhibits a highly transparent, glass-like quality, allowing visibility through its body. Within the glass, there is a detailed, white, lattice pattern that precisely mirrors the architectural design of the Eiffel Tower. This includes the arched base, vertical supports, and intricate ironwork, all rendered in a way that mimics the actual towerâ€™s framework. The transparency and internal detailing suggest an embossed or etched design on the glass surface, consistent with how decorative bottles might feature iconic structures. This matches the visual characteristics of a glass bottle containing a stylized representation of the Eiffel Tower.",

      "question": "Is there a gold-colored, metallic-looking base supporting the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of the bottle-shaped structure in Image B, there is a distinct rectangular block that appears to be made of a reflective, gold-colored material. Its polished surface and geometric shape contrast with the transparent glass above, suggesting it serves as a base or pedestal for the bottle. This gold element is consistent with luxury packaging designs often seen in high-end perfume or liquor bottles, where such bases are used for aesthetic appeal. Therefore, the presence of a gold-colored, metallic-looking base is evident.",

      "question": "Is there a faint depiction of a Parisian skyline visible on the surface of the glass bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the lower portion of the glass bottle in Image B, just above the gold base, there is a subtle silhouette of buildings that resemble a city skyline. These include pointed rooftops and spires characteristic of Parisian architecture, such as those found in Notre-Dame or other historic buildings. The outline is not prominent but is faintly etched or engraved into the glass, creating a layered effect beneath the Eiffel Tower image. This detail suggests a deliberate artistic inclusion of a Parisian skyline, reinforcing the theme of Paris encapsulated within the bottle.",

      "question": "Is there a small, simple, and modern logo located at the neck of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the bottle, near the neck, there is a clear cap with a small, minimalist logo. The logo consists of a single letter 'R' enclosed in a square frame, which is both simple and modern in design. This placement and style are typical of branding on premium products, where logos are subtly placed for recognition without overwhelming the design. The 'R' is centered and cleanly rendered, indicating intentional design rather than accidental markings. Thus, the presence of such a logo is confirmed.",
