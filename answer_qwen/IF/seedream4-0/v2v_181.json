      "question": "Is the sheep and clock scene enclosed within a transparent snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep and clock are clearly visible inside a spherical, transparent enclosure with a wooden base, which is characteristic of a snow globe. The glass dome has reflections and refractions consistent with a transparent material, and there are snowflake patterns both on the interior surface and floating within the globe, reinforcing the snow globe design. The presence of artificial snow at the base further supports this conclusion. Based on visual cues such as the rounded shape, reflective surface, and internal snow elements, it is reasonable to conclude that the scene is enclosed in a snow globe.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe rest on a wooden tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the snow globe in Image B is mounted on a circular wooden platform with visible wood grain patterns. This platform sits atop a larger surface that exhibits similar wood texture and coloration, consistent with a wooden table. The lighting creates warm highlights and shadows typical of sunlight interacting with polished wood, suggesting a natural wooden tabletop. There are no signs of metal or plastic surfaces beneath the globe, supporting the conclusion that it rests on wood.",

      "question": "Is the scene illuminated by gentle, ambient lighting, casting warm glows on the table and nearby areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays soft, diffused lighting with warm golden tones illuminating the snow globe and the surrounding area. The light appears to come from a window or natural source off-frame, creating subtle highlights on the glass and wood surfaces. The glow is not harsh or direct, and shadows are soft and elongated, indicating ambient illumination. Additionally, there are lens flare-like effects and glowing particles, enhancing the impression of gentle, warm lighting. This matches the characteristics of natural daylight filtering through a window, commonly associated with cozy indoor scenes.",

      "question": "Are the sheep and clock depicted as adorable chibi-style 3D models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sheep in Image B has exaggerated features typical of chibi art style—large head relative to body, oversized eyes, simplified facial expression, and rounded limbs. Its wool is fluffy and stylized rather than realistic. The clock also has a simplified, cartoonish design with clean lines and proportions that suggest a toy-like or decorative model. Both objects appear three-dimensional but rendered in a way that emphasizes cuteness and stylization over realism. These visual traits align with the definition of chibi-style 3D models commonly used in animated or collectible designs.",

      "question": "Is the sheep casually leaning against the clock inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the snow globe, the sheep is positioned with its body slightly angled toward the clock, and its back appears to be touching or resting against the side of the clock. The posture suggests a relaxed, casual lean rather than standing upright or sitting independently. The orientation of the sheep’s body and the proximity to the clock support the interpretation that it is leaning against it. This interaction adds a sense of playfulness and intimacy to the scene, fitting the whimsical nature of the snow globe.",

      "question": "Are there gently drifting snowflakes surrounding the sheep inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the snow globe, multiple white snowflake shapes are visible in various positions throughout the space. Some appear to be suspended mid-air, while others seem to be falling slowly, consistent with the motion of snowflakes in a snow globe when shaken. The snowflakes vary in size and opacity, and their placement around the sheep enhances the wintry atmosphere. Although static in the image, their distribution and appearance strongly suggest they are meant to represent gently drifting snowflakes, a hallmark feature of snow globes.",
