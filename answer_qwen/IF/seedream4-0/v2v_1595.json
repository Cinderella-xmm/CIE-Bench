      "question": "Does the edited image feature a halftone pattern with dots creating shades and gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the soccer ball and surrounding elements exhibit a distinct texture composed of small dots, particularly noticeable in the shading of the ball's surface and the grass. This dot-based texture is characteristic of a halftone pattern, commonly used in print media and graphic design to simulate continuous tones using only dots of varying sizes and spacing. The use of halftone is evident in the way gradients are formed on the ball—such as the transition from light to dark areas—and in the background elements like the grass, which uses varying dot densities to create depth and color variation. This technique is consistent with digital art styles that emulate comic book or pop art aesthetics. Therefore, based on visual cues and knowledge of graphic design techniques, it is clear that a halftone pattern is present.",

      "question": "Are there vivid contrasts between the colors and elements in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a high level of color contrast, especially between the bright green of the field, the black and white of the soccer ball, and the glowing white sparkles on the goalpost. Additionally, the use of vibrant hues such as purple, pink, and red around the ball and in the background enhances the visual impact. These colors are not only saturated but also sharply delineated from one another, contributing to a dynamic and eye-catching composition. The contrast is further amplified by the stark black background, which makes the illuminated elements stand out even more. This use of strong color contrasts is typical in stylized or pop-art-inspired imagery, designed to capture attention and convey energy. Thus, based on the visual evidence and understanding of color theory, the image exhibits vivid contrasts.",

      "question": "Do the soccer ball and goalpost in the edited image have sharp, well-defined edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the soccer ball and the goalpost are rendered with crisp, clean outlines. The edges of the ball’s pentagons and hexagons are clearly demarcated, and the goalpost has distinct borders with no blurring or softening. Even though the image uses artistic effects like halftone and glow, the structural boundaries remain sharp and precise. This clarity in edge definition is achieved through high-contrast rendering and deliberate line work, common in graphic illustrations. Comparing this to typical photographic representations where edges might be softer due to lighting or focus, this version emphasizes clarity and form. Therefore, the edges are indeed sharp and well-defined.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the soccer ball and goalpost been simplified into bold, graphic forms while remaining recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The soccer ball in Image B retains its classic black-and-white panel structure, but the representation is stylized—using exaggerated highlights, halftone textures, and vibrant color accents (like purple and pink) along the edges. Similarly, the goalpost is depicted with a glittery, sparkly outline and simplified netting, emphasizing its geometric shape without intricate detail. Despite these artistic simplifications, both objects remain instantly identifiable as a soccer ball and goalpost. This transformation aligns with graphic design principles where real-world objects are abstracted into bold, symbolic forms for visual impact. The simplification enhances recognizability through iconic shapes and strong visual cues rather than realism. Hence, they have been simplified yet remain fully recognizable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a combination of vivid colors, dramatic lighting effects (such as starbursts and glows), and a stylized artistic approach that creates a highly energetic and visually arresting scene. The use of halftone patterns, contrasting colors, and sharp lines contributes to a sense of movement and excitement. The placement of the ball in front of the goalpost, combined with the radiant sparkles and colorful field, adds depth and dynamism to the composition. This style evokes pop art or comic book aesthetics, known for their boldness and emotional intensity. Compared to a standard photograph, this version is intentionally exaggerated for impact. Therefore, the overall visual effect is undeniably striking, vibrant, and dynamically composed.",
