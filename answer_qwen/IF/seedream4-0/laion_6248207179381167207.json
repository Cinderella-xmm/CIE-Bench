      "question": "Are the patterned surfaces of the handbag replaced with sleek geometric silver and turquoise motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the handbag has undergone a significant transformation. The original monogram pattern is no longer present. Instead, the bag features a highly stylized design dominated by metallic silver elements with sharp geometric shapes, including angular lines, diamond patterns, and vertical stripes. These are accented with turquoise inlays that add contrast and depth. This visual shift from a classic repeating logo pattern to a modern, structured motif clearly indicates a replacement of the original pattern. The use of reflective silver material and deliberate color blocking suggests a deliberate stylistic overhaul focused on geometric abstraction.",

      "question": "Do the leather straps feature metallic accents such as silver trim, hardware, or reflective finishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leather straps in Image B retain their brown leather appearance, consistent with traditional materials used in luxury handbags. However, upon close inspection, the metal hardware connecting the straps to the body of the bag—such as the buckles and attachment rings—has been upgraded to silver-toned components. These metallic elements have a polished, reflective finish, contributing to the overall futuristic aesthetic. While the straps themselves remain leather, the integration of silver-colored metal hardware constitutes a clear addition of metallic accents, aligning with the updated design language.",

      "question": "Are there intricate machine-age engravings visible along the edges of the handbag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows detailed decorative elements along the edges of the handbag, particularly around the top rim and the borders of the front flap. These include fine scrollwork and linear patterns that resemble mechanical or industrial designs. The style evokes early 20th-century 'machine-age' aesthetics, commonly associated with Art Deco and industrial design movements. The precision of these engraved lines, combined with the metallic sheen, suggests intentional craftsmanship mimicking machinery or architectural ornamentation. This detail reinforces a sense of technological sophistication and historical design influence.",

      "question": "Does the overall design exhibit characteristics of Art Deco style, including geometric symmetry, metallic finishes, and refined elegance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design in Image B strongly reflects Art Deco principles. It features symmetrical geometric patterns, such as repeated triangles, diamonds, and vertical lines, which are hallmarks of the Art Deco movement. The use of metallic silver surfaces with high reflectivity and contrasting turquoise inserts adds to the luxurious and modernist appeal typical of this style. Additionally, the clean lines, bold contrasts, and ornamental detailing all contribute to a sense of refined elegance. Art Deco often celebrated industrial progress and opulence, both of which are mirrored in this reimagined handbag’s aesthetic.",

      "question": "Has the structural form and proportions of the handbag been preserved despite the stylistic changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A (the original), the fundamental structure of the handbag remains unchanged. The silhouette, including the rectangular shape, the placement of the front flap, the zippered top closure, and the dual strap attachments on either side, is identical. While the surface texture, color scheme, and decorative elements have been completely transformed, the underlying architecture of the bag—its size, volume, and functional layout—has been maintained. This suggests that the redesign focused on aesthetic embellishment rather than altering the core functionality or physical dimensions.",
