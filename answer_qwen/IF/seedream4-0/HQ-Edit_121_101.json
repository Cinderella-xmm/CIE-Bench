      "question": "Is the image presented as a series of separate stamp-like elements arranged in a grid or collection format, each resembling a paper-cut design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The image shows a single, cohesive composition rather than multiple individual stamps arranged in a grid. While the style is reminiscent of paper-cut art with layered, intricate cutouts, there is only one central figure and background depicted. There are no visible borders or separations that would suggest multiple stamps. The entire image appears unified, with the woman and architecture forming a continuous scene within a single frame. Therefore, it does not match the description of a collection of separate stamp-like elements.",

      "question": "Are the floral embroidery details on the hanbok enhanced with visible metallic foil effects (e.g., shiny, reflective highlights)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the hanbok in Image B, the floral embroidery features subtle but noticeable sheen and reflective qualities, especially on the petals and stems. These areas exhibit light-reflecting properties consistent with metallic foil application, such as gold or silver accents, which are commonly used in decorative crafts and paper art to add dimension and luster. The texture appears slightly raised and glossy, suggesting intentional enhancement beyond standard colored paper. This aligns with traditional decorative techniques often seen in artisanal paper-cut designs.",

      "question": "Has the bow on the hanbok been visibly enlarged compared to its original size in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the bow on the hanbok is proportionally sized relative to the garment and the figureâ€™s torso. In Image B, the bow appears significantly larger and more prominent, occupying a greater portion of the chest area. It has a more exaggerated, stylized form typical of artistic interpretations in paper-cut art, where proportions may be altered for visual impact. Comparing both images, the bow in Image B is clearly enlarged, serving as a focal point in the design. This change reflects an intentional stylistic exaggeration common in illustrative representations.",

      "question": "Is the traditional Korean architectural background clearly visible and properly integrated into the overall composition of the stamp series?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The traditional Korean architecture in Image B is rendered in a paper-cut style, featuring tiered roofs, ornate eaves, and red pillars characteristic of palaces like Gyeongbokgung. Although simplified, the structure is clearly identifiable and positioned behind the figure, maintaining spatial coherence. The integration into the composition is seamless, with the building serving as a backdrop that complements the subject. However, since this is not a 'series' of stamps but a single artwork, the term 'stamp series' is misleading. Despite this, the architectural element is clearly visible and well-integrated within the singular piece.",

      "question": "Is the entire stamp series displayed on a surface that resembles embossed leather with visible texture and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features a rich brown surface with intricate embossed patterns along the edges and corners, resembling tooled leather. These textures include swirling floral motifs and fine lines that mimic the appearance of hand-tooled leather goods. The surface provides a three-dimensional quality, enhancing the perception of depth and craftsmanship. This textured backdrop frames the central paper-cut figure, giving the impression that the artwork is mounted on or part of a leather-bound book or case. Thus, the surface strongly resembles embossed leather with visible texture and depth.",
