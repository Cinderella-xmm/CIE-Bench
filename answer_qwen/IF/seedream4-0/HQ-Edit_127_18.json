      "question": "Is the entire elephant and savannah scene enclosed within a visible vintage travel case structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly framed by the edges of a brown, leather-bound suitcase with visible latches, hinges, and a handle. The interior of the suitcase forms a backdrop for the miniature landscape, which includes the elephant, grass, tree, and mountains. The lid of the suitcase is open, revealing a painted sky with clouds on its inner surface. This indicates that the entire diorama is contained within a structured, vintage-style travel case. The visual cues—such as the suitcase's metallic corners, stitching along the edges, and the way the scene fits perfectly inside—support the conclusion that it is enclosed within a visible travel case structure.",

      "question": "Do the elephant and landscape elements appear as detailed miniature 3D models with realistic scaling and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in Image B is rendered with intricate details such as textured skin, defined wrinkles, and proportionate tusks, consistent with a high-quality 3D model. The surrounding environment—including the acacia tree, grass tufts, and distant mountain—also exhibits fine detailing and layered textures, suggesting they are three-dimensional models rather than flat illustrations. The use of shadows, lighting, and perspective enhances the sense of depth, giving the impression of a carefully crafted diorama. The relative sizes of objects (e.g., the elephant compared to the tree) maintain plausible scale, reinforcing the realism of the miniature setup. These visual characteristics align with realistic 3D modeling techniques used in dioramas.",

      "question": "Is the ground covered with a material that resembles grass but has a textured, resin-like finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ground in Image B features upright, yellowish-green tufts that mimic grass. However, these tufts have a uniform, slightly glossy appearance with sharp edges and consistent spacing, which is characteristic of molded or cast materials like resin or plastic rather than natural vegetation. The texture appears artificial and manufactured, suggesting it was created using sculpting or casting techniques common in dioramas. This resin-like quality is further supported by the smooth base beneath the 'grass' and the overall polished look of the terrain. Therefore, while the material resembles grass, its finish is distinctly artificial and textured in a way typical of resin-based modeling.",

      "question": "Is there a small-scale acacia tree placed in the diorama to indicate scale balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A single acacia tree is present in the right side of the diorama, positioned near the edge of the suitcase. It is significantly smaller than the elephant, yet proportionally accurate to real-world dimensions when considering the scale of the entire scene. The tree’s shape—with a broad canopy and slender trunk—is typical of an acacia, and its placement helps establish environmental context and spatial balance. Its size relative to the elephant and the surrounding landscape suggests it serves both aesthetic and scaling purposes, helping viewers perceive the correct proportions of the diorama. Thus, it functions as a key element in maintaining visual and scale harmony.",

      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky depicted as painted elements on the inner surface of a backdrop lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is shown on the inner surface of the suitcase lid, which is painted blue with white and light gray cloud formations. These clouds are not three-dimensional or volumetric; instead, they appear flat and stylized, consistent with hand-painted or printed artwork. Their placement directly on the curved interior of the lid confirms that they are part of a static backdrop. This technique is commonly used in dioramas to simulate a sky without adding depth or physical bulk. The lack of shadowing or layering on the clouds supports the conclusion that they are painted elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom front of the suitcase, just outside the main diorama area, there is a small, round object with a golden hue and a visible compass rose (a star-shaped design with cardinal directions). It has a looped ring and a classic design typical of vintage brass compasses. This object rests on the surface beneath the suitcase, indicating it is part of the display setup. Its placement and appearance strongly suggest it is a decorative or thematic accessory meant to enhance the 'adventure' or 'exploration' motif of the diorama. Therefore, the presence of a brass-colored compass is confirmed.",
