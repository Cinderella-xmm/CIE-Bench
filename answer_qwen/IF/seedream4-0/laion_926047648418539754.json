      "question": "Is the overall image rendered in a stylized, illustrative manner consistent with 1920s Art Deco fashion illustrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is clearly not a photograph but a digital illustration. The rendering style features clean lines, flat color application with minimal shading, and a highly stylized representation of the human figure—common traits in fashion illustrations. The background is composed of bold geometric shapes in gold and black, which are hallmark elements of Art Deco design popular in the 1920s. The woman's pose, posture, and facial features are idealized and simplified, aligning with the aesthetic of vintage fashion illustrations from that era. These visual cues, combined with the known characteristics of 1920s Art Deco art and fashion media, support the conclusion that the image is styled in a manner consistent with Art Deco fashion illustrations.",

      "question": "Does the dress feature a flapper-style silhouette with geometric patterns and fringe along the hem or edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B has a form-fitting, knee-length cut typical of the flapper style popular in the 1920s. It includes a V-neckline and thin straps, consistent with the sleeveless designs of that era. The garment is adorned with intricate geometric patterns—diamonds and angular lines—that are characteristic of Art Deco motifs. Additionally, long fringe hangs from the bottom edge of the dress, which was a defining feature of flapper attire, designed to sway during movement. This combination of silhouette, pattern, and fringe strongly indicates a flapper-style design.",

      "question": "Has the bag been replaced with a beaded clutch featuring detailed beadwork and a design consistent with 1920s fashion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag is no longer the leopard-print pouch with tassels seen in Image A. Instead, it is a small, structured clutch covered in what appears to be intricate beadwork, forming a patterned surface. This type of embellished handbag is historically accurate for 1920s fashion, where beaded and sequined accessories were widely used to complement flapper dresses. The clutch’s compact size and ornate detailing reflect the luxurious and decorative nature of Art Deco-era accessories. Therefore, the bag has indeed been replaced with one that matches the stylistic conventions of the 1920s.",

      "question": "Are the shoes now T-strap style with a refined, vintage design suitable for the 1920s?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The footwear in Image B consists of open-toed heels with thin straps that cross over the instep and wrap around the ankle. This design closely resembles the T-strap shoe style that was iconic in the 1920s, particularly among flappers. These shoes were often made of leather or patent material and featured low to moderate heels. While the heels in this image appear slightly elevated, the strap configuration and overall silhouette remain consistent with vintage 1920s fashion. Thus, the shoes have been updated to match a period-appropriate, refined design.",

      "question": "Does the background feature bold, linear geometric patterns in gold and black, characteristic of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is composed of sharp, angular lines forming repeating geometric shapes such as triangles and zigzags. These patterns are arranged symmetrically and use a striking contrast between gold and black on a cream or off-white base. This color scheme and motif are quintessential elements of Art Deco design, which flourished in the 1920s and 1930s. The use of symmetry, metallic tones, and linear abstraction reflects the architectural and decorative influences of the era. Therefore, the background fully embodies the visual language of Art Deco aesthetics.",
