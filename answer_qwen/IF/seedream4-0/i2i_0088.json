      "question": "Is the fork in the original image now replaced with a spoon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object placed on the blue napkin is clearly a spoon, not a fork. The shape of the utensil—specifically the rounded bowl at one end and the elongated handle—is characteristic of a spoon. In contrast, a fork would have tines (prongs) at the end, which are absent here. Given that Image A shows a fork on a similar blue napkin, and Image B shows a spoon instead, it can be concluded that the fork has been replaced. This replacement is evident from the distinct morphological differences between forks and spoons, supported by common knowledge of tableware design.",

      "question": "Is the spoon depicted in gold color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spoon in Image B has a shiny, reflective surface with a warm yellowish hue consistent with gold. The metallic sheen and coloration are typical of gold-plated or solid gold utensils. While some lighting conditions might alter perception, the overall appearance aligns with gold rather than silver or stainless steel. Based on visual cues such as reflectivity and tone, combined with world knowledge about metal finishes, the spoon is indeed depicted in gold color.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the spoon's handle in Image B, intricate embossed designs are visible. These include floral motifs and swirling patterns, which are commonly found in ornate or ceremonial cutlery. Such detailing is not present in plain or modern-style spoons, indicating intentional decoration. This observation is supported by common knowledge of decorative dining ware, where elaborate patterns often signify luxury or traditional craftsmanship.",

      "question": "Has the napkin in the background remained unchanged in appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The napkin in both images appears to be the same deep blue fabric, folded similarly into a cylindrical shape. However, the angle and lighting differ slightly between the two images, which may affect perceived texture and shadowing. Despite these minor variations in presentation, the color, material, and fold style remain consistent. There is no indication of a change in the napkin’s design, pattern, or material. Therefore, based on visual comparison and general understanding of how consistent objects appear under different angles, the napkin has remained unchanged in appearance.",

      "question": "Is the original fork completely removed from the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains only a spoon on the napkin; there is no trace of the fork seen in Image A. The absence of any prongs or fork-like structure confirms that the original fork has been entirely replaced. Since the spoon occupies the same spatial position and the background remains consistent, it is logical to infer that the fork was fully removed and substituted. This conclusion relies on comparing the content of both images and applying common sense about object substitution in static scenes.",
