    "Question": "Q1: Has the word “Shine” been added to the mirror?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror displays the word 'Shine' in a glowing, illuminated font. This is not present in the original image (Image A), where the mirror is blank. The presence of this text is clearly visible and distinct, indicating that it has been digitally or physically added. Given that mirrors in modern bathrooms are sometimes equipped with smart features like LED displays or programmable messages, the addition of such text is plausible. However, since it is absent in Image A, it confirms that it was introduced in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the word “Shine” positioned centrally in the mirror?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the word 'Shine' is horizontally and vertically centered within the reflective surface of the mirror. Its placement aligns symmetrically with the mirror's frame and the surrounding bathroom elements, such as the sink and faucet below. In design terms, central alignment often enhances visual harmony and balance, which is consistent with the minimalist aesthetic of the space. Comparing to Image A, where no text exists, the symmetry and positioning of 'Shine' in Image B suggest intentional centering for aesthetic impact.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the word “Shine” appear to have a backlit glowing effect?",
    "explanation": "The word 'Shine' in Image B emits a soft, warm glow, particularly noticeable around the edges of the letters. This luminous quality suggests backlighting, similar to neon signs or LED displays. The light appears to originate from behind the text, creating a halo effect that contrasts subtly with the otherwise neutral tones of the mirror and wall. This effect is consistent with modern smart mirrors or decorative lighting installations. Since such effects are not present in Image A, the glowing appearance is a new feature introduced in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the font and color of the word “Shine” visually match the modern and minimalistic style of the bathroom?",
    "explanation": "The font used for 'Shine' is clean, sans-serif, and fluid, resembling contemporary typography often seen in minimalist design. The color is a soft, warm white or pale yellow, which complements the neutral palette of the bathroom—light wood, white cabinetry, and gray walls. The glowing effect adds a subtle touch of warmth without overwhelming the space. This choice of font and color integrates well with the overall modern and uncluttered aesthetic, avoiding overly ornate or distracting elements. The design decision reflects an understanding of minimalism, where simplicity and harmony are prioritized.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Does the addition of the word “Shine” maintain the overall aesthetic balance of the bathroom?",
    "explanation": "The addition of 'Shine' introduces a focal point within the mirror, but due to its central placement, soft glow, and harmonious color, it does not disrupt the balance of the room. Instead, it enhances the ambiance by adding a motivational and serene element that aligns with the calming, modern design. The text is not intrusive; it blends into the environment rather than dominating it. Compared to Image A, which lacks any textual or decorative elements on the mirror, Image B’s addition feels purposeful and tasteful, contributing positively to the space without breaking its minimalistic integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
