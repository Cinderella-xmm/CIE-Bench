      "question": "Is the door now visually transformed into a mystical guardian creature with distinct animalistic or mythical features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the door has undergone a significant transformation. The central portion of the door now features a large, detailed owl-like face with glowing eyes, prominent beak, and feathered texture extending from the top and sides. This facial structure is integrated directly into the door's design, giving it an anthropomorphic or mythological appearance. The addition of wings, a crown, and a cloak-like drapery further enhances the impression of a sentient, guardian-like entity. These elements are not typical of standard architectural doors but are characteristic of fantasy or mythical guardians. Therefore, based on visual cues such as the owl’s head, glowing eyes, and regal adornments, the door is clearly transformed into a mystical creature.",

      "question": "Are there feathered wings extending from the sides of the door, formed by the extension of the original geometric patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two large, detailed wings extend from either side of the door. These wings are composed of layered feathers that appear to emerge from the wooden surface, blending seamlessly with the door’s structure. While the original door in Image A features intricate geometric carvings, the wings in Image B are not merely extensions of those patterns—they are sculpted, three-dimensional structures made of feathers. However, the design does incorporate a stylistic continuity; the feathers follow a patterned arrangement reminiscent of the original geometric motifs, suggesting a thematic evolution rather than a literal transformation of the patterns. Thus, while the wings are not formed directly from the original geometric patterns, they are artistically derived from them in style and placement.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the door’s metal knobs been transformed into shimmering, eye-like features with reflective or glowing properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metal knobs on the door in Image B remain largely unchanged in form and function—there are still rows of dark, spherical studs arranged vertically along the door. However, the most prominent metallic feature is the large golden knob at the center, which retains its original shape and does not exhibit any eye-like or glowing characteristics. In contrast, the glowing effect is concentrated in the owl’s eyes above the door, not in the metal knobs. Therefore, despite the magical atmosphere of the scene, the metal knobs have not been transformed into shimmering or glowing eyes.",

      "question": "Has the arch above the door been transformed into a celestial crown with radiant or star-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper part of the doorframe has been replaced by a golden crown adorned with jewels and emitting bright star-like rays. This crown sits atop a draped fabric structure that forms a canopy over the owl-headed door. The original arched doorway from Image A is no longer visible—it has been entirely reimagined as a regal crown with luminous stars, symbolizing royalty or divine authority. This transformation aligns with the mythical theme, turning the architectural arch into a celestial emblem. Thus, the arch has indeed been transformed into a radiant crown.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible etched runes or symbolic inscriptions covering parts of the wooden surface of the transformed creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, vertical lines of symbols resembling ancient runes or glyphs are visible along the central axis of the door, particularly on the wooden panels flanking the golden knob. These inscriptions appear stylized and non-linguistic, fitting the mystical aesthetic. They are not present in the original door (Image A), indicating they were added during the transformation. Their placement and design suggest symbolic or magical significance, consistent with the theme of a mystical guardian. Therefore, these etched markings qualify as symbolic inscriptions.",

      "question": "Has the doorframe been transformed into a flowing, cloak-like structure that wraps around the creature, resembling a regal garment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone doorframe from Image A has been replaced by a large, draped fabric structure that flows down from the crown and envelops the owl-headed door. This cloth appears heavy and textured, resembling a royal mantle or ceremonial cloak. It drapes symmetrically on both sides, creating a sense of grandeur and reverence. This transformation turns the rigid architectural frame into a soft, dynamic element that enhances the creature’s regal and mythical presence. Thus, the doorframe has indeed been reimagined as a flowing, cloak-like garment.",
