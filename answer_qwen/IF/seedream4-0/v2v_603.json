      "question": "Have the skiers been converted into 3D chibi-style characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two skiers are depicted with large heads, small bodies, and simplified facial features—hallmarks of chibi art style. Their proportions are exaggerated, with oversized heads relative to their torsos and limbs, which is characteristic of chibi or 'super-deformed' anime characters. Additionally, the rendering has a smooth, rounded, and stylized 3D appearance, suggesting digital modeling rather than realistic human representation. This contrasts sharply with typical realistic depictions of humans. Based on these visual cues and knowledge of chibi art conventions, it is clear that the skiers have been transformed into 3D chibi-style characters.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the skiers wear realistic winter clothing: one in a red hoodie and dark pants, the other in a blue jacket and dark pants, both with backpacks and ski poles. In Image B, while the color schemes (red and blue jackets) and general gear (backpacks, ski poles, skis) are preserved, the design is stylized. The outfits appear more simplified and cartoonish, with less texture and detail. For example, the backpacks are sleeker and more geometrically simple, and the skis lack realistic wear or snow accumulation. Although the core elements are present, they are not identical due to the artistic transformation into a chibi style. Therefore, while similar, the gear is not identical.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the core environmental elements of a snowy forest: tall evergreen trees covered in snow, a foggy atmosphere, and a snow-covered ground. These visual cues align with the original scene in Image A. While the lighting and depth may be slightly altered for stylistic purposes in the 3D rendering, the fundamental setting—a wintry forest path—is preserved. There is no indication of a change in location or environment; the background remains consistent with a snow-laden pine forest. Thus, the setting has been maintained, even if stylized.",

      "question": "Is the original arrangement of the environment, including the positions of the skiers and trees, preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the two skiers are positioned side by side on a snowy trail, with trees flanking both sides of the path and a misty backdrop. In Image B, the skiers are still placed similarly—side by side—but their orientation and spacing are subtly adjusted. The left skier (in red) appears slightly closer to the viewer, and the right skier (in blue) is turned more toward the camera, altering the dynamic. Moreover, the trees in the background seem less dense and more evenly spaced, possibly due to simplification for the 3D model. While the general layout is preserved, the precise spatial relationships and depth perception differ slightly. This suggests that the arrangement has been adapted for stylistic clarity but not perfectly preserved.",

      "question": "Do the skiers exhibit exaggerated proportions and simplified features typical of chibi art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the skiers in Image B clearly display traits of chibi art. They have disproportionately large heads compared to their bodies, minimal facial details (such as simple eyes and mouths), and rounded, smooth forms. Their limbs are short and stylized, lacking anatomical realism. These features are consistent with chibi aesthetics, which emphasize cuteness and simplicity over realism. Combined with the 3D rendering style, this confirms that the characters are designed in a chibi format, using exaggerated proportions and simplified features.",
