      "question": "Is the man depicted wearing a trench coat and a fedora-style hat consistent with a noir detective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is wearing a long, dark coat that resembles a trench coat, which is a classic element of noir detective fashion. However, he is wearing a beanie-style hat rather than a fedora. While the trench coat aligns with the noir aesthetic, the hat does not. The fedora is a quintessential accessory in noir films and literature, often associated with private investigators like Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade. Since the man is wearing a beanie instead, the overall look is only partially consistent with the traditional noir detective archetype. Therefore, while the coat fits, the hat deviates from the expected style.",

      "question": "Is the man in a contemplative pose, such as looking away thoughtfully or touching his face/chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is standing sideways, facing the advertisement, with his head slightly lowered and hands in his pockets. His posture suggests introspection or contemplation, but he is not actively touching his face or chin. He appears to be gazing at the poster, possibly reflecting on its meaning, which aligns with a thoughtful mood. However, there is no direct physical gesture like touching his face or chin that would explicitly signal contemplation. Given the context of the scene and the presence of a thought bubble, it can be inferred that he is in a reflective state, but the visual evidence for a contemplative pose (as defined by hand-to-face gestures) is absent.",

      "question": "Does the background feature an eerie urban environment with elements such as dark alleys, wet pavement, or dim lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a nighttime urban street scene with several key elements contributing to an eerie atmosphere. The lighting is dim, primarily provided by a single streetlamp casting a soft glow, which creates deep shadows and enhances the noir ambiance. The pavement appears wet, reflecting light and suggesting recent rain, a common trope in noir settings. The background includes narrow streets lined with buildings, contributing to a sense of confinement and mystery. These visual cues—dim lighting, wet ground, and narrow alley-like surroundings—are all characteristic of a classic noir urban environment. Thus, the setting strongly supports the eerie, moody tone typical of noir aesthetics.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Coca-Cola Noir\" visible in the image using a vintage-style font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the advertisement prominently displays the words 'Coca-Cola NOIR' at the bottom. The font used for 'Coca-Cola' is the iconic script style associated with the brand, which has a vintage feel. The word 'NOIR' is written in a bold, uppercase serif font, reminiscent of classic film noir typography. This combination of fonts evokes a retro, stylized aesthetic that aligns with the theme of the image. The use of 'Noir' in conjunction with the Coca-Cola branding further reinforces the artistic, surreal tone. Therefore, the text is both visible and styled in a way that reflects a vintage or retro design appropriate for the theme.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there thought bubbles present near the man’s head containing text or imagery related to the mystery of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clearly visible thought bubble above the man's head. Inside the bubble, the text reads 'What's behind the label?' This phrase directly engages with the theme of the advertisement and the man's apparent contemplation of it. The inclusion of a thought bubble with textual content is a hallmark of comic book or graphic novel storytelling, and here it serves to emphasize the narrative tension between the man and the idealized figure in the ad. The question posed relates to consumerism, authenticity, and hidden truths—central themes in surreal or noir-inspired art. Therefore, the presence of a thought bubble with meaningful text confirms this element.",

      "question": "Is the image rendered in monochrome and styled like a comic strip, with clear panel borders or stylized line work?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is indeed rendered in monochrome (black and white), which is consistent with both noir aesthetics and comic strip styles. However, there are no visible panel borders or stylized line work such as halftone dots, speech bubbles (other than the one already discussed), or exaggerated outlines that are typical of comic strips. The composition is photographic in nature, with realistic lighting and depth, even though it uses a dramatic, high-contrast black-and-white palette. While the thought bubble adds a comic-like element, the overall image lacks the structural features of a comic strip panel. Therefore, although it shares some stylistic traits, it is not styled like a comic strip in a formal sense.",

      "question": "Is there a clear visual juxtaposition between the noir detective and the stylized advertisement figure, reinforcing the surreal theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man stands in a gritty, atmospheric urban setting, dressed in a trench coat and beanie, embodying a noir detective archetype. In contrast, the advertisement features a stylized, idealized blonde woman drinking Coca-Cola, portrayed in a clean, polished manner with bright lighting and a modern aesthetic. This stark contrast between the real, weathered world of the man and the artificial, glamorous world of the ad creates a strong visual juxtaposition. The addition of the thought bubble questioning 'What's behind the label?' further emphasizes this duality, highlighting themes of authenticity versus illusion. This contrast is central to the surreal quality of the image, blending reality and advertising fantasy in a way that critiques consumer culture. Thus, the juxtaposition is both visually and thematically significant.",
