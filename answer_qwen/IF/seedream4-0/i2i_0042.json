      "question": "Has the person been transformed into a chibi-style collectible figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is depicted in a highly stylized, cartoonish form with exaggerated features such as a large head, small body, and simplified facial details—hallmarks of the 'chibi' art style commonly used in anime and collectible figures. The figure appears to be superimposed over the original photo, rendered in a flat, two-dimensional manner typical of digital illustrations or collectible character designs. This transformation suggests that the real person has been replaced by an animated version designed to resemble a collectible figure. The visual cues—such as the outlined silhouette, simplified proportions, and lack of realistic textures—strongly support this conclusion.",

      "question": "Is the chibi figure depicted with arms raised?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the chibi figure has both arms raised upward in a celebratory or triumphant pose. The hands are clenched into fists, and the arms extend above the head, which is a common gesture associated with excitement or achievement in cartoon depictions. This posture is consistent with the theme of reaching a milestone (as suggested by 'Level 6'), reinforcing the idea of celebration. There is no ambiguity in the positioning of the arms, as they are clearly elevated and bent at the elbows.",

      "question": "Are there still multiple servings of burgers and fries piled high on the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table displays only one prominent serving of a burger and fries, which is significantly larger than normal and stacked vertically, suggesting exaggeration for effect. While there are other items like drinks and condiments, the number of meal servings has been reduced compared to the original image. The original scene (Image A) showed four separate plates with burgers and fries, but in Image B, these have been consolidated into a single oversized meal. Therefore, although there is a large portion of food, it does not represent multiple servings as seen before. The depiction is more symbolic and stylized rather than literal.",

      "question": "Is there text reading \"Level 6 · Mega Meal\" located behind the chibi figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, white text is visible directly behind the chibi figure. The left side reads 'Level 6' and the right side reads 'Mega Meal', separated by a dot. The font is clean and bold, styled to resemble game-level indicators or achievement titles. The placement of the text is centered horizontally relative to the figure, and it appears to be part of the graphic overlay. This matches exactly with the description provided in the question, confirming its presence and content.",

      "question": "Does the final artwork have the appearance of a trendy acrylic standee character sheet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image in Image B features a transparent outline around the chibi figure and the food items, resembling the design of an acrylic standee often used in pop culture merchandise. These standees typically include cut-out characters with a clear backing and sometimes glow effects or layered elements. In this case, the figure and objects are framed with a glowing translucent border, and the entire composition sits on a blue surface with a slight reflection, mimicking how such standees would appear when placed on a display. Additionally, the flat, illustrative style and inclusion of game-like text ('Level 6') align with modern trends in collectible character sheets used in gaming or social media challenges. Thus, the overall aesthetic strongly resembles a trendy acrylic standee.",
