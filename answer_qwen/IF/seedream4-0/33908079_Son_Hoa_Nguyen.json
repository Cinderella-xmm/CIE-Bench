      "question": "Has the worker been cartoonized with slightly exaggerated or simplified features compared to the original photo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the worker is depicted in a stylized, illustrated form rather than a photorealistic one. The facial features are simplified—such as large, rounded eyes and a small, curved mouth—typical of cartoon or anime-style art. The proportions of the head and body are slightly exaggerated for expressive effect, and the clothing lacks fine textural details seen in real-life fabrics. These stylistic choices align with common cartoonization techniques that prioritize clarity and visual appeal over realism. Comparing this to Image A, where the person has natural facial contours, realistic skin texture, and detailed hair, it is evident that Image B uses artistic simplification. This transformation reflects an intentional shift from photographic realism to illustrative representation.",

      "question": "Are the worker’s hands visibly enlarged in proportion to the rest of the body to emphasize the tea-picking action?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the worker's hands appear larger relative to the rest of the body compared to typical human proportions. This enlargement is a common artistic technique used to draw attention to specific actions—in this case, the delicate process of picking tea leaves. The fingers are clearly defined and positioned to suggest careful plucking, and their size makes them a focal point. In contrast, Image A shows hands in natural proportion, consistent with real human anatomy. The exaggeration in Image B serves both aesthetic and narrative purposes, highlighting the importance of the task. This comparison confirms that the hands have been intentionally enlarged for emphasis.",

      "question": "Do the tea plantation fields display vibrant green and earthy tones as the dominant color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the tea plantation with bright, saturated greens dominating the foreground and midground, representing the lush tea bushes. Interspersed between the rows are patches of brownish-earth tones, suggesting soil or pathways between the plants. These colors are consistent with a natural tea field environment, especially under daylight conditions. The use of vibrant greens enhances the visual appeal and suggests freshness, while the earthy browns add depth and realism to the landscape. This color palette is both artistically pleasing and grounded in real-world observations of agricultural terrains. Compared to Image A, which also features similar green and brown hues, Image B maintains the same dominant color scheme but with a more stylized rendering.",

      "question": "Does the logo on the sack feature a gold foil effect, making it appear shiny and metallic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The logo on the sack in Image B is circular and orange in color, with a white bird-like figure inside. Upon close inspection, the central part of the logo appears to have a reflective, golden sheen, suggesting a gold foil application. This metallic finish gives it a distinct shine, differentiating it from the matte appearance of the surrounding fabric. Such effects are often used in illustrations to simulate premium packaging or highlight branding elements. While Image A shows the same sack with a printed logo, it lacks any metallic sheen—it appears flat and non-reflective. Therefore, the gold foil effect is an artistic addition in Image B, enhancing the visual impact of the design.",

      "question": "Are there decorative vine-patterned borders surrounding the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is framed by a white border adorned with repeating leafy vine patterns along all four edges. These vines are evenly spaced and artistically rendered, forming a delicate frame around the illustration. This decorative element adds a whimsical, nature-inspired touch, reinforcing the theme of agriculture and tea cultivation. The pattern is consistent with common design motifs used in storybooks or botanical illustrations. In contrast, Image A has no such border—it is a straightforward photograph without embellishments. Thus, the presence of these vine borders is exclusive to Image B and contributes to its illustrated, curated aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the image displayed within a textured, recycled paper-style album background or frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is presented as if it were a page in a physical book. The outer edges show a rough, uneven texture resembling aged or recycled paper, with visible creases and a slightly worn appearance. The binding on the left side further supports the idea of a book or album format. This background contrasts sharply with the clean, smooth presentation of Image A, which lacks any framing or contextual setting. The choice of a textured, rustic background in Image B enhances the nostalgic, handcrafted feel of the illustration, suggesting it might be part of a storybook or scrapbook. Therefore, the image is indeed set within a simulated recycled paper-style album.",
