      "question": "Does the edited image show the smartwatch transformed into a full cybernetic wrist dragon with dragon-like anatomy integrated into the wrist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) depicts a smartwatch whose band has been replaced by a highly detailed, metallic silver dragon that wraps around the wrist. The dragon's body is anatomically stylized with scales, spikes, and a head featuring glowing eyes, fangs, and mechanical joints, suggesting a fusion of organic dragon anatomy with cybernetic or mechanical elements. The form extends from the watch case to fully encircle the wrist in a way that mimics a living creature. This transformation goes beyond mere decoration—it integrates the dragon’s structure into the functional form of the wristwear, making it appear as though the watch itself is a part of a biomechanical dragon. Based on visual cues such as the articulated spine, claws, and head, combined with the integration of mechanical components (e.g., gears, joints), this represents a full cybernetic wrist dragon rather than a superficial design. Thus, the transformation is not just aesthetic but structural.",

      "question": "Is the watch face replaced with a radiant, multi-layered holographic dragon eye featuring glowing elements and depth effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The watch face in Image B displays a complex digital interface dominated by a central glowing blue circuit-like pattern resembling a neural network or energy core. While this design is radiant and features depth through light gradients and branching lines, it does not resemble a dragon eye. A dragon eye would typically include features like an iris, pupil, and sclera—none of which are present. Instead, the display contains abstract symbols, geometric patterns, and icons arranged symmetrically around a central point. These elements evoke a sci-fi or tech-magic aesthetic, but they are not structured as an eye. Therefore, despite its luminosity and layered appearance, the display is not a holographic dragon eye.",

      "question": "Are the original silicone band and its contours replaced with a series of interlocking, metallic silver scales that cover the wrist portion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original soft, flexible silicone band from the typical smartwatch (as seen in Image A) has been entirely replaced. The new band is composed of overlapping, metallic silver scales arranged in a segmented, reptilian pattern. These scales are interlocked and follow the curvature of the wrist, forming a continuous armored structure. The texture, reflectivity, and ridge patterns are consistent with those of a dragon’s hide, indicating a deliberate design choice to mimic biological scales. The transition from the watch case to the scaled band is seamless, confirming that the original band has been fully substituted. This transformation aligns with the cybernetic dragon theme.",

      "question": "Has the digital crown been replaced with a glowing, spherical neural node emitting light or energy pulses, resembling a biotech interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital crown on the side of the watch in Image B has been modified. Instead of the standard rotating knob, it now features a spherical, translucent component that emits a bright blue glow. This element appears to pulse with light, suggesting active energy flow or data transmission. Its design includes concentric rings and a central illumination point, resembling a neural node or bio-interface commonly seen in sci-fi depictions of advanced technology. The glowing effect and structural complexity differ significantly from the original digital crown, indicating a replacement with a futuristic, biotech-inspired control mechanism. This change supports the overall cybernetic dragon theme by integrating a high-tech interaction point.",

      "question": "Are the original app icons on the watch face replaced with glowing, rune-like control sigils that emit light and reflect a tech-magic aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original watch face in Image A shows standard app icons such as music, activity rings, and noise level indicators. In contrast, the watch face in Image B displays a set of abstract, glowing symbols arranged around the central circuitry motif. These symbols are geometric and angular, resembling runes or arcane glyphs, and emit a cyan-blue light. They are positioned at cardinal points and have a mystical yet technological feel, blending elements of magic and digital interfaces. Their design is inconsistent with standard app icons and instead suggests symbolic controls for a high-tech or magical system. This transformation reflects a 'tech-magic' aesthetic, where ancient symbolism is merged with futuristic interface design.",

      "question": "Does the edited image display a dynamic form with visual cues such as energy flow, motion lines, or an active posture that conveys movement and life?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents a dragon-shaped band in a coiled, arched posture with its head raised and mouth open, suggesting aggression or alertness. The dragon’s body curves dynamically around the wrist, creating a sense of tension and readiness. Additionally, glowing elements—such as the red-orange eye, the blue-lit digital crown, and the pulsing central display—imply active energy circulation. Although there are no explicit motion lines, the lighting, sharp angles, and pose contribute to a perception of vitality and motion. The combination of mechanical details and glowing effects enhances the illusion of a living, responsive entity. This dynamic presentation contrasts with the static, passive appearance of the original watch, reinforcing the idea of a sentient, animated form.",
