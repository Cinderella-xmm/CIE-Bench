      "question": "Are brass gears and levers visibly integrated into the desk surface or structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desk is heavily adorned with ornate carvings and mechanical elements. Upon close inspection, brass gears are clearly visible within the drawers and structural supports of the desk. These gears are not merely decorative but appear to be functional components, possibly part of a larger mechanical system. Additionally, small levers and pipes extend from the side of the desk, suggesting integration into the furniture's design. This aligns with steampunk aesthetics, where machinery is both functional and stylistically prominent. The presence of these elements indicates that brass gears and levers are indeed integrated into the desk’s structure.",

      "question": "Do the books in the image emit a visible glow and contain mechanical bookmarks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stack of books on the right side of the desk is illuminated with a warm, golden glow emanating from within the pages. This glow suggests internal lighting, possibly from embedded mechanisms or energy sources consistent with steampunk themes. Furthermore, several books have metallic, gear-shaped bookmarks attached, which resemble mechanical devices rather than traditional paper or fabric bookmarks. These bookmarks are detailed with cogs and chains, reinforcing the mechanical theme. The combination of glowing books and mechanical bookmarks is a deliberate design choice that enhances the fantastical, technological ambiance of the scene.",

      "question": "Is the globe on the screen replaced with a floating, translucent 3D holographic model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the computer monitor displays a blue wireframe cube rotating in a grid-like interface. This is not a globe, nor is it a 3D holographic model of Earth. Instead, it appears to be a digital blueprint or schematic of a geometric structure, likely representing a machine or architectural design. While the display has a futuristic feel, it does not depict a globe or any form of planetary representation. Therefore, the globe from the original image (if present) has been replaced with something entirely different—a technical diagram rather than a holographic globe.",

      "question": "Are the window frames decorated with bold, intricate patterns characteristic of steampunk design, such as brass detailing or mechanical motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The window frames in Image B are arched and feature elaborate metalwork, including floral and scroll designs intertwined with circular gears and brass embellishments. These elements are typical of steampunk design, which combines Victorian-era ornamentation with industrial machinery motifs. The use of brass-colored metal and mechanical-looking components like cogwheels and rivets around the windows reinforces the steampunk aesthetic. Unlike standard historical windows, these are clearly stylized to reflect a fusion of artistry and engineering, making them distinctly steampunk in character.",

      "question": "Is the image labeled with the title \"The Time Traveler's Study\" in a stylized font appropriate for a Victorian steampunk aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'The Time Traveler's Study' is prominently displayed at the top center of Image B in a golden, serif font with embossed textures and slight wear effects, giving it an antique appearance. The lettering style evokes Victorian typography, commonly seen in old manuscripts and scientific journals of the 19th century. Combined with the metallic sheen and shadowed depth, the font complements the overall steampunk theme by blending elegance with industrial flair. This styling is consistent with how titles might appear in a fictional narrative involving time travel and advanced retrofuturistic technology.",
