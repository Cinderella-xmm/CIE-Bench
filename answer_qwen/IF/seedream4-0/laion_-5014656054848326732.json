      "question": "Is the overall image rendered in a sepia tone consistent with Victorian-era illustrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image displays a monochromatic color palette dominated by shades of brown and beige, which is characteristic of sepia tones. This tonal quality mimics the appearance of aged paper and ink drawings commonly found in Victorian-era illustrations. The lack of vibrant colors and the use of shading to create depth further align with traditional etching or engraving techniques used during that period. Based on visual cues such as the color scheme and texture, it is reasonable to conclude that the image is rendered in a sepia tone consistent with Victorian artistic styles.",

      "question": "Has the man been dressed in a finely-tailored frock coat instead of a modern shirt and suspenders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is wearing a dark, double-breasted jacket with a high collar and structured lapels, which is consistent with a frock coat—a garment typical of formal men's attire in the 19th century. This contrasts sharply with the modern white dress shirt and black suspenders seen in Image A. The presence of a cravat or necktie beneath the coat also supports the historical styling. Therefore, based on visual evidence and historical fashion knowledge, the man has indeed been dressed in a frock coat rather than modern clothing.",

      "question": "Is there an ornate high-back chair visible behind the man?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Behind the man in Image B, there is a large, intricately carved chair with elaborate scrollwork and a high backrest, featuring decorative finials at the top corners. These design elements are typical of Victorian-era furniture, which often emphasized ornamentation and craftsmanship. The chair’s structure and detailing clearly indicate it is an ornate high-back chair, distinct from the simple desk chair in Image A. Thus, the visual cues confirm the presence of such a chair.",

      "question": "Has the typewriter been replaced with a large, leather-bound book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object on the desk in front of the man is a thick, rectangular book with visible stitching along the spine and a worn leather cover—characteristic of a large, antique-style book. This contrasts with the mechanical typewriter present in Image A. The book appears to be open, and the man is writing on a sheet placed atop it, suggesting its use as a writing surface. Given these visual details and the historical context implied by the illustration style, the typewriter has indeed been replaced with a leather-bound book.",

      "question": "Has the pipe been replaced with a quill pen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is holding a long, feathered writing instrument in his right hand, which is clearly identifiable as a quill pen—a tool historically used before the advent of modern pens. In contrast, Image A shows the man smoking a wooden pipe. The absence of any pipe and the presence of a quill pen, combined with the man’s act of writing, support the conclusion that the pipe has been replaced with a quill pen in the edited version.",

      "question": "Are there intricate, hand-drawn floral motifs surrounding the man, consistent with Victorian graphic design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The borders of Image B feature detailed floral patterns composed of roses, leaves, and vines, drawn in a fine-line style reminiscent of botanical illustrations or decorative frames common in Victorian-era prints. These motifs are symmetrically arranged along the edges of the image, forming a decorative border that enhances the vintage aesthetic. Such designs were frequently used in period publications and artwork to convey elegance and refinement. Therefore, the presence of these intricate floral elements aligns with Victorian graphic design conventions.",
