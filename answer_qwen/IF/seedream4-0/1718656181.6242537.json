      "question": "Is the explosion depicted as a mural painted on a beach wall, rather than occurring naturally in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explosion is clearly rendered in a stylized, two-dimensional manner with bold outlines and flat color areas, characteristic of a mural or graffiti art. The background includes a textured concrete wall with visible cracks and weathering, suggesting it is a physical surface. Additionally, the foreground shows real sand and beach elements, which appear to be part of an actual beach setting, while the explosion and surrounding landscape are painted on the wall behind. This indicates that the explosion is not a natural event but a representation on a wall, consistent with a mural. The perspective and layering of the scene support this interpretation: the painting is viewed from a real-world vantage point, with the artwork being a backdrop to the sandy beach.",

      "question": "Are the colors in the explosion and surrounding elements bright and neon-like, consistent with pop art aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The explosion in Image B features highly saturated, vivid colors such as bright yellow, electric pink, hot orange, and cyan blue, which are typical of pop art style. These colors are not naturalistic but instead exaggerated and vibrant, creating a dynamic and eye-catching effect. The use of contrasting hues and high chroma values aligns with the pop art movement's emphasis on boldness and visual impact. Furthermore, the presence of halftone patterns and sharp color blocking reinforces the pop art aesthetic. This contrasts sharply with realistic depictions, where colors would be more muted and physically plausible. Therefore, the visual cues strongly indicate that the color scheme is intentionally designed to mimic pop art.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all major elements (explosion, clouds, palm trees, landforms) have thick black outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, every significant element—including the mushroom cloud of the explosion, the surrounding clouds, the palm trees, the island, and even the water—has a distinct, thick black outline. These outlines define the shapes clearly and separate them from adjacent areas, a hallmark of comic book and pop art styles. This technique enhances graphic clarity and contributes to the stylized, illustrative quality of the mural. Even subtle details like the individual fronds of the palm trees are outlined, indicating a consistent application of this stylistic choice across the entire composition. There are no exceptions among the major components, confirming that thick black outlines are universally applied.",

      "question": "Are the palm trees stylized with exaggerated forms and bold outlines, consistent with pop art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm trees in Image B are not depicted realistically. Instead, they feature simplified, geometric shapes with elongated trunks and fan-like fronds that are sharply defined by thick black lines. Their proportions are slightly exaggerated, with some appearing taller and more angular than natural palms. The green color is uniform and lacks texture or shading, further emphasizing their stylized nature. These characteristics align with pop art’s tendency to reduce natural forms into iconic, graphic symbols. The trees serve more as decorative elements within the overall design than as accurate representations of flora, reinforcing the artistic intent behind the mural.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are geometric patterns (e.g., stripes, grids, polygons) visibly embedded within the cloud formations of the explosion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cloud formations in the explosion of Image B are composed of irregular, abstract shapes filled with angular segments and sharp edges, particularly in the upper portion of the mushroom cloud. These sections contain triangular and polygonal divisions, often outlined in black, giving them a faceted appearance. Additionally, parts of the cloud exhibit striped or layered effects using alternating colors, resembling halftone patterns commonly used in pop art. While not strictly grids, these geometric subdivisions are clearly present and contribute to the stylized rendering of the explosion. The use of such patterns is intentional and serves to break down organic forms into structured, graphic components, consistent with pop art techniques.",

      "question": "Has the island landscape been transformed into simplified abstract shapes, lacking realistic terrain details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The island in Image B is rendered as a series of flat, geometric planes with sharp angles and solid blocks of color, primarily magenta, red, and yellow. It lacks any realistic topography such as elevation changes, vegetation textures, or erosion patterns. Instead, it appears as a stylized silhouette composed of triangles and parallelograms, typical of abstract or cartoonish design. This abstraction is consistent with the overall pop art aesthetic, where complex natural forms are reduced to simple, recognizable shapes for visual impact. In contrast to a realistic depiction, which would include gradients, shadows, and surface variation, this version prioritizes graphic clarity and symbolic representation over realism.",
