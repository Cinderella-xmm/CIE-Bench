      "question": "Does the cocktail glass appear to be sculpted from clay with visible texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cocktail glass exhibits a rough, uneven surface with visible grooves and ridges that mimic the texture of hand-sculpted clay. The base and sides of the glass show irregularities in thickness and form, consistent with manual shaping rather than machine molding. The color is a uniform terracotta tone, typical of unfired or lightly fired clay, further supporting the interpretation that it is made of clay. These visual cues—texture, color, and imperfections—are characteristic of handcrafted ceramic work. This contrasts sharply with the smooth, transparent appearance of real glass, which would not have such tactile qualities.",

      "question": "Are the ice cubes and lime slice depicted with intricate clay textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ice cubes in Image B are not translucent or reflective as real ice would be; instead, they have a matte finish and a slightly rough surface with defined edges that resemble carved clay blocks. Similarly, the lime slice has a textured rind and a painted green outer layer with visible brushwork and slight inconsistencies, indicating it is modeled from clay rather than being a real fruit. The internal structure of the lime also lacks the fibrous detail seen in actual citrus slices, reinforcing its artificial nature. These elements collectively suggest that both the ice and lime are sculpted from clay with deliberate textural details to simulate realism.",

      "question": "Do the surroundings, including the bar and bottles, exhibit a handcrafted clay appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bar surface in Image B shows a coarse, cracked texture resembling dried clay, with deep fissures and an uneven surface that mimics aged terracotta. The background bottles, while blurred, maintain a consistent earthy tone and shape that aligns with clay modeling. They lack the reflective surfaces and precise labels of real glass bottles and instead appear as simplified, rounded forms with subtle texture variations. The entire scene, including the napkin and bar mat, shares this cohesive aesthetic of hand-sculpted materials. This suggests that the environment has been uniformly transformed into a clay-like representation, maintaining thematic consistency with the central object.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition maintain an organic, imperfect look characteristic of hand-sculpted clay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire composition in Image B displays asymmetry, minor irregularities in shape, and natural-looking surface flaws that are hallmarks of hand-sculpted clay. For example, the rim of the glass is not perfectly circular, and the ice cubes vary slightly in size and shape. The lime wedge appears slightly warped, and the straw is unevenly shaped. These imperfections contribute to an organic feel, contrasting with the precision and symmetry expected in mass-produced items. Additionally, the lighting emphasizes these irregularities, enhancing the handmade quality. This aligns with the known characteristics of artisanal clay work, where uniqueness and variation are valued over uniformity.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting and shading adjusted to enhance the clay-like textures and three-dimensional appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is warm and directional, casting soft shadows that accentuate the depth and contours of the clay objects. The highlights on the edges of the glass, ice cubes, and lime slice emphasize their three-dimensional forms and textured surfaces. The way light interacts with the material—creating subtle gradients and avoiding sharp reflections—mimics how light behaves on matte, non-reflective surfaces like clay. This careful use of lighting enhances the illusion of physical texture and volume, making the sculpture appear more lifelike despite its artificial nature. This technique is commonly used in photography and digital rendering to highlight sculptural qualities.",
