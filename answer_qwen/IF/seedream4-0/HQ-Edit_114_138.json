      "question": "Are there visible gold highlights on the woman's silk robe, particularly along seams, collar, or floral designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is wearing a traditional-style silk robe with intricate floral patterns. Upon close inspection, the edges of the collar, the buttoned fastenings (frog closures), and the cuffs are outlined with distinct golden trim. The floral motifs also appear to have subtle golden accents, especially in the stems and outlines of the flowers. This use of gold detailing is consistent with ornamental embroidery often seen in traditional Chinese attire, where metallic threads enhance elegance. These gold highlights are clearly visible and intentional, suggesting a deliberate stylistic choice to emphasize luxury and craftsmanship.",

      "question": "Does the book display a layered story scene, such as visible illustrations or figures emerging from its pages in multiple planes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the open book held by the woman features a unique visual design: the inner pages are not plain text but contain illustrated scenes that resemble dioramas. On both left and right pages, there are framed illustrations depicting interior settings—such as a room with bookshelves and people engaged in reading or conversation—giving the impression of depth and narrative layering. These illustrations appear to be rendered in a three-dimensional style, with elements like windows, furniture, and human figures positioned at different depths, creating a sense of spatial dimensionality. This effect mimics pop-up books or shadow boxes, where images emerge from the page in multiple planes. Such a feature is highly stylized and not typical of standard books, indicating an artistic enhancement meant to convey storytelling richness.",

      "question": "Do the bookshelves feature ornate decorative elements such as carved patterns, inlaid designs, or filigree details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookshelves in Image B are richly decorated. While they maintain a classic wooden structure, their surfaces are adorned with elaborate decorative panels featuring vintage tea motifs—such as teapots, teacups, and floral arrangements—on ornate tags hanging from the shelves. These tags are intricately designed with scrollwork borders and delicate patterns, resembling antique labels or bookmarks. Additionally, the left side of the shelf frame displays a carved, swirling golden motif, suggesting a Baroque or Rococo influence. These elements go beyond simple shelving; they incorporate inlaid-like ornamentation and filigree-style embellishments, indicating a high level of decorative artistry. Thus, the bookshelves do include ornate decorative features.",

      "question": "Are there visible bookmark panels attached to the book that display vintage tea motifs such as teacups, tea leaves, or traditional tea sets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no physical bookmarks visibly attached to the book itself. However, the surrounding environment includes numerous decorative panels hanging from the bookshelf, each featuring vintage tea-related imagery such as teapots, teacups, and tea sets. These panels resemble bookmarks in shape and design but are affixed to the shelf rather than inserted into the book. Since the question specifically asks about 'bookmark panels attached to the book,' and none are physically connected to the book’s pages or spine, the answer must reflect that these decorative elements are part of the background, not the book. Therefore, while tea motifs are present, they are not attached to the book as bookmarks.",

      "question": "Does the image exhibit a semi-cartoon style characterized by stylized features such as smooth outlines, exaggerated proportions, or simplified shading compared to realistic rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly employs a semi-cartoon or stylized illustration style. The woman has large, expressive eyes, smooth facial contours, and a slightly exaggerated smile, all common traits in animated or cartoon depictions. Her hair is neatly rendered with clean lines, and her clothing features bold, uniform patterns without the subtle texture variations seen in photorealism. The lighting is flat with minimal shadows, and colors are vibrant and evenly distributed, which contrasts with the nuanced shading and depth found in realistic images. Furthermore, the book’s illustrated pages and the decorative shelf tags have a graphic, almost hand-drawn quality. These stylistic choices align with semi-cartoon aesthetics, distinguishing it from a realistic portrayal.",

      "question": "Has the woman’s facial structure, hairstyle, and posture been preserved without significant distortion or alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the overall pose and general appearance of the woman remain consistent with a seated reader, her facial features have been significantly altered in a stylized manner. In Image B, her face is smoother, with larger eyes, more defined cheekbones, and a symmetrical, idealized expression—features typical of cartoon or anime-inspired art. Her hairstyle remains similar—a bun—but is rendered with cleaner, more uniform lines than would be expected in a realistic depiction. Her posture is upright and balanced, consistent with the original setting, but the facial structure is clearly exaggerated for artistic effect. Therefore, although the basic form is preserved, the details have undergone substantial stylization, indicating distortion from a realistic perspective.",
