      "question": "Does the image have a vibrant, clean-lined aesthetic typical of Pixar animations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image features a mouse with exaggerated, stylized proportions and large, expressive eyes, which are characteristic of Pixar's animation style. The color palette is warm and vivid, with smooth gradients and clear, defined edges around the mouse and crumbs. The overall composition is clean and polished, avoiding any gritty or realistic textures that would detract from the cartoonish appeal. These visual elements—such as the soft lighting, simplified shapes, and vibrant colors—are consistent with Pixar’s signature aesthetic, which emphasizes clarity, charm, and emotional expressiveness. Additionally, the background is softly blurred but still maintains a cohesive look that complements the foreground subject without distraction.",

      "question": "Are the textures in the image smooth and simplified in a manner consistent with cartoon-style rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textures in the image are notably smooth and lack fine detail, especially on the mouse's fur, which appears uniformly brushed rather than individually rendered. This simplification is typical of cartoon-style rendering, where realism is sacrificed for stylistic clarity and visual appeal. The crumbs on the floor also have a uniform, slightly rounded appearance, lacking the irregularities seen in real-world crumbs. The tile flooring has a subtle sheen but no visible scratches or wear, further emphasizing the idealized, simplified nature of the scene. These characteristics align with the principles of cartoon rendering, where textures are designed to enhance readability and visual harmony rather than mimic reality.",

      "question": "Does the image feature soft shadowing around the mouse and surrounding objects, contributing to a Pixar-like depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the image includes soft, diffused shadows beneath the mouse and around the crumbs, which create a sense of depth and grounding without harsh contrasts. These shadows are not sharp or overly defined, which is typical of Pixar’s approach to lighting—prioritizing mood and three-dimensionality over photorealism. The subtle gradient of the shadow under the mouse suggests a single, soft light source above, consistent with cinematic animation techniques. This use of shadowing enhances the perception of volume and spatial relationships, reinforcing the Pixar-like quality of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the lighting in the image been adjusted to create a soft, diffused effect typical of Pixar animations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in the image is evenly distributed with no harsh highlights or deep shadows, indicating a soft, diffused illumination. This type of lighting is commonly used in Pixar animations to create a warm, inviting atmosphere and to emphasize character expressions without distracting glare or contrast. The glow on the mouse’s fur and the gentle reflections on the tiled floor suggest a controlled, studio-like lighting setup, which is typical in animated films. Such lighting avoids the starkness of natural daylight and instead provides a balanced, visually pleasing environment that supports the narrative and emotional tone of the scene.",

      "question": "Do all elements in the image, including the floor, crumbs, and background, appear to be seamlessly integrated in a Pixar-style animation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All elements in the image—the mouse, crumbs, floor tiles, and background—are rendered with consistent art direction, ensuring a seamless integration. The color tones are harmonious, with warm browns and tans dominating the palette, creating visual cohesion. The depth of field is carefully applied, blurring the background just enough to focus attention on the mouse while maintaining context. The crumbs are scattered naturally but with artistic intent, and their texture matches the overall stylized look. Even the background appliances (like the refrigerator) are simplified and lack excessive detail, aligning with the cartoon aesthetic. This unified design language is a hallmark of Pixar-style animation, where every element serves the visual narrative without breaking immersion.",
