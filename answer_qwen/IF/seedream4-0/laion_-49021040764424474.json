      "question": "Is the entire body of the truck constructed from visible LEGO bricks in orange, black, and silver colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is clearly a LEGO model. The body panels are made up of interlocking LEGO bricks, with the main body in bright orange, the bed and trim elements in black, and the side steps and wheel hubs in silver. These colors are consistent across the vehicle's structure, and the modular nature of LEGO construction is evident in the visible studs and brick patterns. The entire exterior is composed of LEGO elements, with no non-LEGO materials visible. This aligns with typical LEGO vehicle designs where every part is built from standardized bricks. Therefore, based on visual evidence and knowledge of LEGO construction, the entire body is indeed made from visible LEGO bricks in these colors.",

      "question": "Are the wheels composed entirely of circular gray LEGO pieces, replacing the original tire and rim design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheels in Image B are constructed using LEGO components. They feature large, round gray tires made from multiple LEGO pieces that simulate tread patterns, with central hubs that resemble rims. These are not solid or continuous rubber tires but are instead assembled from individual LEGO parts. The design mimics the shape and function of real tires but uses only LEGO elements—specifically circular gray pieces for the treads and silver-gray hubcaps. This is consistent with how LEGO vehicles replicate real-world components using modular building blocks. Thus, the wheels are entirely composed of circular gray LEGO pieces, replacing the original tire and rim design seen in real trucks.",

      "question": "Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth black LEGO tiles, replacing the original textured surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck bed is lined with black LEGO tiles that have a flat, smooth appearance, contrasting with the textured metal-like surface of the real truck in Image A. These tiles are arranged to cover the entire floor of the bed, forming a uniform, non-textured surface. While some LEGO models use studless tiles for aesthetic purposes, this one clearly uses smooth black tiles to represent the bed floor. The absence of any visible texture or pattern indicates it is designed to be smooth, unlike the ribbed or grooved surface typically found on real pickup truck beds. Therefore, the bed is fully covered with smooth black LEGO tiles, replacing the original textured surface.",

      "question": "Is the LEGO truck placed on a plain white shelf that elevates it above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO truck is positioned on a clean, flat, white platform that appears to be a display shelf. This shelf is elevated above the gravel ground seen in the background, which matches the setting of Image A. The shelf has sharp edges and a minimalist design, typical of product display stands used in photography. It is uniformly white and provides a neutral base that contrasts with the colorful LEGO model. There are no signs of supports or legs beneath the shelf in the frame, but its elevation is clear from the gap between the bottom of the shelf and the ground. Based on visual cues and common display practices, the truck is indeed placed on a plain white shelf that elevates it.",

      "question": "Does the LEGO model retain the correct shape and proportions of the original pickup truck, including the cab, bed, and wheelbase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B (the LEGO model) with Image A (the real truck), the LEGO version closely mirrors the overall shape and proportions of the original vehicle. The cab, bed, and wheelbase are accurately scaled relative to each other. The length of the bed, the height of the cab, and the spacing between the wheels all reflect the real truck’s dimensions. While minor details like door handles and side mirrors are simplified due to LEGO constraints, the silhouette and structural layout remain faithful. LEGO often prioritizes recognizable form over exact replication, and in this case, the model maintains the correct general proportions. Therefore, despite being made of bricks, the LEGO truck retains the essential shape and scale of the original pickup.",
