      "question": "Is the teapot now a cylindrical container instead of its original rounded shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object that was previously a teapot in Image A has been transformed into a tall, cylindrical container. This is evident from its vertical, tubular form with a flat top and bottom, which contrasts sharply with the rounded, bulbous shape of a traditional teapot seen in Image A. The new object resembles a tea canister or storage container rather than a functional teapot. Based on visual cues such as the uniform circular cross-section and the presence of a lid with Japanese characters, it is clear that the object has been redesigned into a cylindrical container. This change aligns with common packaging design for premium tea products, where cylindrical tins are often used to preserve freshness and present an elegant aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are floral patterns embossed in golden foil on the surface of the teapot container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cylindrical container in Image B features intricate floral designs, including a prominent bouquet of flowers such as chrysanthemums and peonies, along with leaves and berries. These patterns appear to be applied in a metallic gold finish, giving them a raised, embossed look typical of gold foil decoration. The sheen and texture suggest a reflective material consistent with gold foil, commonly used in luxury packaging to convey elegance and value. Additionally, the background of the container has a mottled golden texture, further emphasizing the use of gold foil as a primary decorative element. This technique is frequently used in traditional Japanese tea packaging to signify quality and cultural heritage.",

      "question": "Are the teacups redesigned as nested stackable units, each with a decorative lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teacups are arranged in a stacked formation, with one cup placed atop another, and the topmost cup has a lid, indicating that they are designed to nest within each other. The visible cups show consistent size progression, allowing them to fit snugly inside one another. Each cup also features ornate floral patterns and decorative rims, suggesting they are part of a coordinated set. The inclusion of a lid on the uppermost cup implies that this is not just a stacking feature but also a functional design choice, possibly for storing tea or preserving aroma. This design reflects a practical yet aesthetically pleasing approach often seen in travel or gift tea sets.",

      "question": "Is there Japanese calligraphy displayed across the top of the packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the lid of the cylindrical container in Image B, two large black kanji characters are prominently displayed: 'èŒ¶' (cha), meaning 'tea'. This is a common symbol used in Japanese tea culture and branding. To the left of these characters, smaller vertical script is also visible, likely providing additional details such as the type of tea or brand name. The placement and style of the writing are consistent with traditional Japanese calligraphy, often used on tea packaging to evoke authenticity and cultural significance. The use of calligraphy reinforces the product's connection to Japanese tea traditions.",

      "question": "Is a bamboo motif visible along the side of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Along the right side of the cylindrical container in Image B, a dark green bamboo stalk is clearly depicted, complete with segmented nodes and leafy branches extending outward. Bamboo is a recurring motif in Japanese art and design, symbolizing resilience and simplicity. Its inclusion here enhances the cultural authenticity of the packaging, aligning with traditional aesthetics associated with tea ceremonies. The stylized representation of bamboo, combined with the floral elements, creates a harmonious composition that reflects nature-inspired design principles common in East Asian craftsmanship.",

      "question": "Is the entire tea set packaging presented on a flat white surface with no other background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tea set in Image B is displayed against a plain, uniformly white background. There are no visible textures, shadows beyond those cast by the objects themselves, or additional elements such as furniture or decor. The lighting is even and diffused, typical of studio photography used for product presentation. This minimalist setup emphasizes the product without distraction, focusing attention solely on the packaging and teacups. Such a presentation is common in commercial product imagery to highlight design details and ensure clarity for marketing purposes.",
