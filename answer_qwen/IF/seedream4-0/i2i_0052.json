      "question": "Are the two players depicted in a chibi art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B are drawn with exaggeratedly large heads, small bodies, and simplified facial features—hallmarks of the chibi art style. This style is commonly used in anime and manga to create cute, stylized versions of characters. The proportions, such as the oversized heads relative to the body and the minimalistic design of limbs and clothing, align perfectly with typical chibi aesthetics. Additionally, the overall cartoonish and playful appearance further supports this classification.",

      "question": "Do the players retain their original outfits and hairstyles after being chibi-fied?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both characters are wearing white tennis dresses with blue collars and black shoes, which resemble standard tennis attire. Their hairstyles are represented by fluffy white wool-like hair that mimics sheep's wool, consistent with the animal theme but adapted into a cartoon form. While the outfit details are simplified due to the chibi style, the core elements (white dress, blue collar, skirt) remain recognizable. The 'hairstyle' is not human hair but rather a stylized representation of sheep fleece, which has been preserved in shape and color. Thus, while transformed stylistically, the essential features of their original appearance are retained.",

      "question": "Are both players holding tennis rackets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each character in Image B is clearly depicted holding a red-and-black tennis racket in one hand. The rackets are detailed enough to show strings and grips, indicating they are meant to represent actual tennis equipment. Both figures hold them in a similar pose, suggesting readiness for play or a ceremonial gesture. There is no ambiguity in the visual representation—the rackets are present and held by each player.",

      "question": "Are the two players shaking hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The two characters in Image B are shown extending their right hands toward each other, with fingers interlocked in a clear handshake gesture. This action is typically symbolic of sportsmanship or agreement, especially in competitive settings like tennis. The positioning of their arms and hands, along with the symmetry of the pose, confirms that they are engaged in a handshake. No other interaction is occurring, making this the dominant gesture.",

      "question": "Is there a semi-transparent court logo visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the background of Image B, behind the two characters, there is a faint outline resembling a tennis court net and possibly part of a court boundary. It appears light green and translucent, blending subtly into the background. This suggests a stylized, semi-transparent representation of a tennis court logo or field layout. While it is not a distinct emblem, its presence contributes to the thematic setting of a tennis match. Given its transparency and integration into the background, it qualifies as a semi-transparent court-related graphic.",

      "question": "Has the edited image been output as a sticker image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a white border around the characters with a slight drop shadow effect, giving the impression of a die-cut sticker. This design choice is common in digital stickers, especially those used in messaging apps or collectible designs. The clean edges, rounded corners, and layered appearance suggest it has been formatted specifically for use as a sticker. Additionally, the way the characters are isolated from the background with a soft glow enhances this sticker-like quality.",
