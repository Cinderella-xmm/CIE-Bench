        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the elephant is uniformly gray with no texture, gradient, or variation in color. This is consistent with a matte solid gray background, which is often used in digital editing to isolate subjects for design purposes. The absence of any environmental elements such as water, sky, or vegetation further supports that the background has been replaced. Based on visual cues and common image editing practices, this indicates a deliberate change to a neutral, solid background.",

      "question": "Are there any visible shadows in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are subtle shadows beneath the elephantâ€™s body, particularly under its legs and along the edge where it meets the rock surface. These shadows appear natural and are consistent with lighting from above, suggesting directional light casting soft shadows. While the background is plain, the presence of these shadows adds depth and realism to the composition. Therefore, shadows are indeed visible, even if they are not dramatic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image contains no banana shape or metal stand. The subject is an elephant standing on a rock, with a small metallic ring visible near its front leg, possibly part of a fixture or tether. There is no banana or stand present in either image. Therefore, the question appears to be based on a misunderstanding or misidentification of objects in the image. Since neither the banana nor the stand exists, they cannot be highlighted effectively.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a single elephant centered against a solid gray background, with only the rock surface and a small metal ring visible. There are no distracting elements such as additional animals, vegetation, or complex scenery. The composition focuses solely on the elephant, emphasizing simplicity and clarity. This aligns with the principles of minimalistic design, which prioritize essential elements and eliminate clutter. Thus, the image adheres to minimalism.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "A minimalistic design asset typically features a clean, uncluttered composition with a clear focal point, neutral background, and limited distractions. Image B satisfies these criteria: the elephant is the central subject, the background is a solid gray (neutral), and only essential elements like the rock and a small metal ring are included. Such an image is suitable for use in graphic design, illustrations, or digital assets where simplicity and focus are required. Therefore, it meets the standards of a minimalistic design asset.",
