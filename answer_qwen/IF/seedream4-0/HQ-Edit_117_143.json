      "question": "Is the overall image rendered with a glossy finish that reflects light, giving it the appearance of a high-quality art postcard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image displays a polished, vibrant aesthetic with high contrast and rich color saturation. The surface of the ground beneath the dancer shows clear reflections of the moonlight and the fiery skirt, suggesting a glossy or wet-like texture. This reflective quality enhances the visual depth and gives the impression of a premium print or postcard. Additionally, the lighting is carefully balanced to highlight the silhouette and flames, reinforcing the idea of a professionally rendered artwork meant for display. These visual cues—such as specular highlights on the floor and smooth gradients in the sky—are typical of high-quality digital art prints designed to mimic physical postcards.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the dancer’s silhouette been simplified and stylized with bold, smooth lines and exaggerated proportions characteristic of cartoon art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dancer in Image B is depicted as a dark silhouette with clean, flowing outlines. Her form is highly stylized—her limbs are elongated, her posture dramatic, and her hair and dress exaggerated in motion. These features align with common characteristics of cartoon or illustrative art styles, where forms are simplified and proportions are enhanced for expressive effect. Unlike realistic depictions, the edges are sharp and uniform, lacking fine anatomical detail, which further supports the cartoonish interpretation. The overall design prioritizes visual impact over realism, consistent with stylized artistic representations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ruffles of the dancer’s skirt visibly larger and more voluminous than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skirt appears dramatically transformed into a swirling mass of flame-like shapes that extend outward far beyond the natural volume of a traditional flamenco dress. While Image A shows a realistically layered red skirt with defined ruffles, Image B's version is significantly expanded and abstracted. The 'ruffles' are now composed of dynamic, flame-shaped elements that occupy much more space and appear more expansive. This transformation suggests an intentional exaggeration of volume and movement, making the skirt visually larger and more voluminous than in the original.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the ruffles of the dress appear as swirling flames with fiery colors (red, orange, yellow) and dynamic, flame-like shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower portion of the dancer’s dress in Image B is clearly rendered not as fabric but as a cascade of fire. The colors transition from deep red at the top to bright orange and yellow at the edges, mimicking the natural gradient of flames. The shapes are fluid, curling, and dynamic, resembling actual fire rather than textile folds. This artistic choice transforms the skirt into a literal representation of fire, emphasizing motion and energy. Such a depiction is consistent with symbolic or fantastical interpretations often seen in animated or stylized art.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a golden crescent-shaped reflection of the moon visible on the ground beneath the dancer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the tiled ground in front of the dancer, there is a distinct golden crescent shape that mirrors the position and form of the moon in the sky. This reflection is glowing and slightly distorted, consistent with how light might reflect off a wet or polished surface. The placement and curvature match the moon’s orientation, indicating it is a deliberate artistic addition to enhance symmetry and atmosphere. This reflection contributes to the magical and ethereal tone of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image have a border around the edges featuring a starry night sky pattern, contributing to an ethereal atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is framed by a decorative border that includes small stars and a subtle celestial motif along its perimeter. This border echoes the star-filled sky within the image, creating a cohesive visual theme. The inclusion of such a frame adds a sense of completeness and fantasy, typical of illustrated postcards or collectible art prints. The border’s design reinforces the dreamlike, otherworldly mood established by the night sky and flaming dress.",
