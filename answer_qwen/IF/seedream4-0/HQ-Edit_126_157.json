      "question": "Is the image presented within a visible hand-carved wooden frame that encloses the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly shows a detailed, ornate wooden frame surrounding the central scene. The frame features intricate carvings with swirling patterns and naturalistic designs resembling wood grain and organic forms, consistent with traditional hand-carved craftsmanship. The depth and texture of the frame suggest it is a physical object, not a digital overlay. This frame acts as a border, enclosing the entire scene, which includes the figure in the boat and the background landscape. Based on visual cues such as the three-dimensional appearance, shadows, and fine detailing, it can be concluded that this is indeed a hand-carved wooden frame.",

      "question": "Are the boat, water, and hills depicted as separate, layered cutout elements rather than a continuous photographic scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style suggests a crafted, artistic representation rather than a realistic photograph. The boat appears to be made of carved wood with visible layering and joints, particularly at the edges where it meets the transparent base. The water beneath the boat is rendered as a flat, glass-like surface with embedded droplet-shaped elements, indicating it is not a continuous liquid but a stylized representation. The hills in the background are simplified into geometric, layered shapes with smooth gradients and lack realistic depth or texture, suggesting they are painted or cut-out elements placed behind the foreground. These characteristics—layered materials, flat textures, and artificial separation between elements—are consistent with a diorama or shadow box art form, where components are physically distinct and arranged in layers. Therefore, the elements are not part of a continuous scene but are separate, layered cutouts.",

      "question": "Does the boat exhibit aged wood textures such as cracks, grain patterns, and weathered surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boat in Image B is rendered in a highly textured, wood-like material. Upon close inspection, the surface of the boat shows clear grain patterns, variations in color tone, and simulated cracks and grooves that mimic natural aging. The planks appear to have uneven edges and slight warping, typical of weathered wood. Additionally, the way light interacts with the surface highlights these textural details, reinforcing the impression of an aged, handcrafted wooden structure. These visual cues align with real-world expectations of old wooden boats exposed to water and time. Thus, the boat does exhibit aged wood textures.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the distant hills rendered in soft, pastel blue gradients instead of realistic green or gray tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hills in the background of Image B are depicted using a series of layered, stylized mountain shapes. Their coloration consists primarily of soft, muted blues and light grays, with subtle gradients that create a sense of atmospheric perspective. There is no presence of green vegetation or earthy tones typically associated with natural landscapes. Instead, the colors are deliberately abstract and harmonious, resembling watercolor or painted backdrops commonly found in traditional East Asian art or modern minimalist design. This choice of palette emphasizes tranquility and aesthetic simplification over realism. Hence, the hills are indeed rendered in soft, pastel blue gradients rather than realistic natural tones.",

      "question": "Are there visible, delicate droplet-like etchings on a transparent layer above the water surface to mimic ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the boat and across the surface of the 'water,' there is a transparent, glass-like layer. On this layer, small, spherical, reflective elements are arranged in patterns that resemble water droplets or bubbles. These elements are evenly spaced and appear to be embedded within the transparent material, creating the illusion of ripples or reflections. Their placement and clarity suggest they are not actual water but artistic representations designed to simulate movement and texture. Given their precise, decorative nature and positioning, they function as etched or applied droplet-like features meant to mimic water dynamics. Therefore, yes, such droplet-like etchings are present.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the foreground (boat), midground (water), and background (hills) appear as distinct, physically separated layers contributing to depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a strong sense of layered composition. The boat is positioned on a raised wooden platform, physically elevated above the transparent water layer, which itself sits in front of the painted or printed backdrop of the hills. The separation between these elements is evident through differences in material, lighting, and spatial depth. For example, the boat casts a shadow onto the water layer below, indicating it is not flush with the surface. The water layer has its own defined edges and supports the boat via a structural base. Behind all of this, the hills are flat and two-dimensional, clearly set apart as a background panel. This arrangement creates a tiered, three-dimensional effect typical of shadow boxes or dioramas, where each component is a separate physical layer. Thus, the foreground, midground, and background are distinctly separated and contribute to a constructed sense of depth.",
