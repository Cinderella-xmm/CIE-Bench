      "question": "Is there an anthropomorphic teddy bear wearing a lab coat and engaged in a scientific activity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is a teddy bear with human-like features, such as wearing glasses and a white lab coat, which are typical attire for a scientist. The bear's posture and expression suggest it is part of a scientific or educational theme. Although the bear is not actively performing an experiment (e.g., holding a test tube), its presence in a lab coat in front of a chalkboard filled with scientific doodles implies engagement in a scientific context. This aligns with the concept of anthropomorphism—assigning human traits to animals—commonly used in children’s educational media. Therefore, the bear is anthropomorphized and positioned within a scientific setting.",

      "question": "Are there playful, cartoon-style illustrations of lab equipment visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains several hand-drawn elements on the chalkboard that resemble lab equipment, such as a beaker with red liquid, a test tube with red contents, and a magnifying glass. These illustrations are stylized with exaggerated shapes and bright colors (like red and blue), consistent with a cartoonish, child-friendly design. They are not realistic depictions but rather simplified, whimsical versions of real laboratory tools. This artistic choice suggests they are meant to appeal to children and convey scientific themes in a fun way.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there scientific symbols, formulas, or doodles drawn in vibrant chalk colors (e.g., red, white, yellow) on a dark green background resembling a chalkboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is a dark green surface resembling a traditional chalkboard. On this surface, various drawings are made in bright, chalk-like colors including red, yellow, blue, and white. These include atomic symbols, stars, chemical structures, and mathematical expressions like 'A² ='. The style mimics chalk drawings with textured lines and uneven edges, reinforcing the impression of a classroom environment. The use of vibrant colors and thematic doodles supports the idea of a playful science lesson.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there words such as \"curiosity,\" \"imagination,\" or \"joyful\" written in playful, hand-drawn typography around the illustrated elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the words 'JOYFUL,' 'CURIOSITY,' and 'IMAGINATION' are clearly visible on the chalkboard. Each word is rendered in a distinct, hand-drawn style using different colors: 'JOYFUL' in red, 'CURIOSITY' in yellow, and 'IMAGINATION' in blue. The lettering has a casual, sketchy appearance typical of chalk writing, with slight irregularities and expressive strokes. These words are strategically placed among the doodles, reinforcing the theme of joyful learning and creativity.",

      "question": "Are there additional animal characters (other than the main teddy bear) depicted engaging in scientific activities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the right side of the chalkboard in Image B, two additional animal characters are visible: a fox using a telescope and a rabbit conducting an experiment with a beaker. Both animals are drawn in a cartoon style and are shown interacting with scientific tools—activities commonly associated with exploration and discovery. Their inclusion adds variety to the scene and emphasizes the theme of curiosity across species, making the learning experience more inclusive and imaginative.",

      "question": "Do the characters and elements in the image display cheerful expressions, bright colors, and a lighthearted tone that suggest a joyful learning atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition of Image B conveys a cheerful and inviting mood. The teddy bear has a smiling face, and the other animal characters (fox and rabbit) also appear happy and engaged. The color palette includes bright reds, yellows, blues, and whites against the dark green background, creating high contrast and visual energy. The playful fonts, whimsical doodles, and exaggerated features contribute to a lighthearted, fun atmosphere appropriate for children’s education. This aesthetic aligns with the goal of promoting joy in learning.",

      "question": "Are all illustrations and text rendered in a style consistent with chalk drawings on a blackboard (e.g., hand-drawn lines, limited color palette, textured appearance)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artwork in Image B exhibits characteristics typical of chalk drawings: uneven lines, slightly smudged textures, and a limited but vibrant color palette (red, yellow, blue, white). The letters and doodles have a hand-drawn quality, with variations in stroke thickness and imperfections that mimic actual chalk marks on a board. Even though digital rendering may have been used, the visual style closely emulates traditional chalk art, maintaining consistency throughout the image. This stylistic choice enhances the educational and nostalgic feel of the scene.",
