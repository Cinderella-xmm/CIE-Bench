    "Question": "Q1: Is the light bulb character depicted with a smiling face including eyes and a mouth, while maintaining the original glass and metal cage design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the light bulb character in Panel 1 has a cartoonish face drawn directly onto the glass surface of the bulb, featuring two round eyes and a curved smile. This facial expression is clearly visible and anthropomorphizes the bulb. The surrounding structure — the black metal cage and the industrial-style base — closely resembles the original design seen in Image A, preserving the form and function of the cage. The filament inside the bulb remains illuminated, consistent with the original lighting element. Therefore, despite the addition of a face, the core design elements (glass bulb and metal cage) are maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does Panel 1 show the anthropomorphic bulb character standing with arms akimbo inside a vintage laboratory environment?",
    "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the light bulb character is indeed standing upright on two legs and has arms positioned akimbo (hands on hips), which conveys a confident posture. The background includes various vintage scientific instruments such as beakers, dials, gears, and retro machinery, all characteristic of a steampunk or vintage laboratory setting. These elements collectively create an environment that aligns with a classic inventor’s workshop, reinforcing the idea of a nostalgic, mechanical era. Thus, both the pose and setting match the description.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a text box in Panel 1 that contains the exact quote “I illuminate ideas brighter than the brightest innovation!”?",
    "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, a speech bubble is present to the right of the light bulb character. Inside this bubble, the text reads: 'I illuminate ideas brighter than the brightest innovation!' The wording matches exactly, including capitalization and punctuation. The font style is bold and stylized, typical of comic book dialogue, and the placement is consistent with standard comic panel conventions. There is no variation in spelling or phrasing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does Panel 2 show the bulb character in an energetic swinging motion, with visible sparks being emitted?",
    "explanation": "In Panel 2, the light bulb character is depicted mid-swing, holding onto chains above it, suggesting dynamic movement. Its legs are bent and splayed, indicating forward momentum. Additionally, bright yellow-orange sparks are visibly emanating from its hand, enhancing the sense of energy and action. The background uses speed lines and explosive color gradients (reds and oranges) to emphasize motion and intensity. These visual cues confirm both the swinging motion and the emission of sparks.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the colors used in the comic strip rich, bold primary colors and metallic shades consistent with a classic comic book style?",
    "explanation": "The color palette in Image B features strong contrasts and saturated tones: deep reds, vibrant yellows, blues, and metallic grays and golds. These are hallmark characteristics of classic comic books, especially those from the mid-20th century. The use of metallic hues for machinery and golden glows around the bulb further enhances the retro-futuristic aesthetic. The background gradients and shading techniques also align with traditional comic art styles, using bold outlines and flat areas of color to define forms. Therefore, the overall color scheme fits the described comic book style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are stylized retro gadgets and gears visible in the background of both panels?",
    "explanation": "In Panel 1, the background includes detailed illustrations of vintage lab equipment: glass flasks, dials, valves, and large brass gears mounted on walls — all rendered in a stylized, exaggerated manner typical of retro sci-fi or steampunk designs. In Panel 2, similar elements appear: industrial machines with gauges, pipes, and additional gears, particularly in the lower right corner. These objects are consistently stylized across both panels, reinforcing a cohesive thematic environment rooted in retro technology. Thus, stylized retro gadgets and gears are present in both panels.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Is all text rendered in bold, capitalized letters using a 1950s comic book-style font?",
    "explanation": "Both speech bubbles in Image B contain text written in bold, uppercase letters. The font has rounded edges and thick strokes, reminiscent of 1950s comic book lettering, commonly seen in superhero comics of that era. The style is playful yet clear, with slight irregularities in stroke width that mimic hand-lettered effects. No lowercase letters or alternative fonts are used in the visible text, confirming consistency in typography throughout the comic strip.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the image presented as a two-panel comic strip with clear separation between Panel 1 and Panel 2?",
    "explanation": "Image B is structured into two distinct horizontal panels stacked vertically. A solid black line separates the top panel (Panel 1) from the bottom panel (Panel 2), creating a clear visual division typical of comic book layouts. Each panel contains its own scene, characters, and dialogue, with changes in setting and action between them. The composition adheres to standard comic strip formatting, ensuring easy reading flow and narrative progression.",
    "answer": "Yes"
