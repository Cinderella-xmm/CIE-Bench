      "question": "Does the background depict a cyberpunk city at night with dark urban landscapes and high-tech architecture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features tall, futuristic buildings with glowing neon lights in vibrant colors such as pink, blue, and purple. These structures have sharp geometric designs and illuminated outlines, which are characteristic of cyberpunk aesthetics. The sky is dark, indicating nighttime, and the overall environment has a high-tech, dystopian feel typical of cyberpunk themes. This visual style aligns with common depictions of cyberpunk cities in media and art, where advanced technology coexists with urban decay and neon-lit streets. Based on these visual cues and world knowledge of cyberpunk imagery, the background can be confidently identified as a cyberpunk city at night.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there neon lights visible and reflecting off a skateboard in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard has bright red and blue light strips along its underside, which emit a glow. These lights reflect onto the glossy surface of the road beneath the skateboard, creating vivid reflections. Additionally, the surrounding environment is filled with neon lights from the buildings, which contribute to the overall illumination and reflection effects. The presence of these glowing elements and their reflections on both the skateboard and the ground confirms that neon lights are indeed visible and interacting with the skateboard's surface. This is consistent with the aesthetic of neon-lit environments commonly seen in cyberpunk or futuristic settings.",

      "question": "Is the boy in the image wearing halo-style headphones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boy in Image B is wearing large headphones with a distinctive circular design around the ear cups. The outer ring of the headphones emits a bright blue glow, forming a halo-like effect. This type of headphone design, especially with the glowing ring, is commonly referred to as 'halo-style' headphones and is often associated with futuristic or tech-themed visuals. The glowing element enhances the cyberpunk aesthetic and matches the overall theme of the image. Based on this visual evidence and common terminology used in digital art and fashion, the headphones qualify as halo-style.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there motion blur present in the air around the boy and skateboard to convey a sense of speed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows streaks of light and blurred lines in the background, particularly along the road and surrounding structures, suggesting rapid movement. These streaks are horizontally oriented and radiate outward from the center of motion, which is typical of motion blur used to depict speed in photography and digital art. Additionally, the boy’s posture—leaning forward with arms outstretched—reinforces the impression of dynamic motion. While the skateboard itself is in focus, the background elements exhibit clear signs of motion blur, effectively conveying a sense of high velocity. This technique is widely used in visual media to emphasize speed and action.",

      "question": "Does the image exhibit an edgy and cool style characterized by sharp contrasts and unconventional color schemes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image employs a striking color palette dominated by electric blues, purples, pinks, and neon accents against a dark background. These colors create high contrast and a visually intense atmosphere, which is typical of edgy, modern, and futuristic styles. The use of glowing elements, sharp lines, and dynamic lighting further enhances the cool, avant-garde aesthetic. The combination of these visual elements aligns with contemporary trends in digital art and cyberpunk culture, where unconventional color schemes and bold contrasts are used to evoke excitement and innovation. Therefore, the image clearly exhibits an edgy and cool style.",
