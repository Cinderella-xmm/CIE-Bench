      "question": "Has the central green block been converted into a 3D chibi-style cartoon character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central green block from Image A is no longer present as a standalone block. Instead, it has been reimagined as a 3D chibi-style cartoon character holding a green LEGO-like brick with a red rose on top. The character is depicted in a stylized, cute form with exaggerated features typical of chibi art—large head, small body, and simplified facial expressions. This transformation involves not just a change in shape but also in narrative function: the block is now part of a character's prop rather than an object in itself. Based on visual cues such as the character’s proportions, facial features, and the way the green brick is integrated into the scene (held by hands), we can infer that the original green block has been creatively repurposed into a symbolic element within a new character-driven context. Therefore, the green block has indeed been transformed into a chibi-style character’s accessory, not the character itself. However, since the question asks whether the block 'has been converted into' a chibi character, and the block is now being held by one, the answer hinges on interpretation. But strictly speaking, the block itself hasn't become the character—it's part of the character's interaction. Hence, the answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Have the red blocks been redesigned as lively supporting characters with charming, playful expressions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red blocks from Image A are no longer static building pieces. They have been artistically transformed into anthropomorphic heart-shaped characters with arms, legs, eyes, and expressive faces—such as smiling, winking, or joyful expressions. These hearts exhibit playful and animated behaviors, suggesting they are supporting characters in a whimsical narrative. Their design includes limbs and facial features, which aligns with common depictions of personified objects in children’s media and romantic illustrations. While the original red blocks were uniform and geometric, these new characters retain the color and general red hue but are clearly redesigned to be dynamic and emotionally expressive. Thus, the red blocks have undergone a significant transformation into lively, cartoonish characters with charming personalities.",

      "question": "Has the environment been transformed into a romantic proposal scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a soft, pastel-colored setting with a central character dressed in formal attire (a vest and tie) holding a green brick with a red rose—a classic symbol of romance. Surrounding this figure are animated hearts with joyful expressions, floating hearts in the air, and scattered heart-shaped confetti on the ground. The overall composition, including lighting, color palette, and thematic elements (roses, hearts, affectionate poses), strongly suggests a romantic atmosphere. This contrasts sharply with Image A, which is a neutral, abstract pile of LEGO bricks. The transformation from a simple arrangement of toys to a narrative scene involving love and courtship indicates a deliberate shift toward a romantic proposal theme. Therefore, the environment has been reimagined as a romantic proposal scene.",

      "question": "Has the background been updated with soft pastel colors and realistic textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is rendered in soft pink tones with subtle texture resembling fabric or paper, giving it a gentle, dreamy appearance. The use of pastel colors—particularly light pinks and creams—is consistent with romantic or Valentine’s Day-themed visuals. Additionally, the surface appears slightly textured, possibly simulating a soft material like velvet or cotton, enhancing the tactile quality of the scene. This is a stark contrast to Image A, where the background is entirely composed of red LEGO bricks with no visible texture beyond their plastic surface. The transition from a monochromatic, industrial-looking backdrop to a warm, delicate one supports the conclusion that the background has been updated with soft pastel colors and realistic textures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small red and white heart-shaped fragments are scattered across the ground around the central character and the animated hearts. These resemble confetti commonly used in celebratory or romantic contexts. Their placement and size suggest they are decorative elements meant to enhance the festive and affectionate mood of the scene. In contrast, Image A contains no such decorative elements—only solid red LEGO bricks. The presence of these heart-shaped pieces in Image B, combined with their distribution pattern and visual style, confirms that heart-shaped confetti has been added to the setting.",
