      "question": "Is the statue and its base fully enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is clearly positioned inside a large, transparent, dome-shaped structure that resembles a glass bell jar. The entire statue and its immediate base are contained within this dome, which extends from the ground level up to a rounded top. The transparency of the dome allows full visibility of the statue and surrounding elements, such as the small trees and grass. Based on visual cues, there is no gap or opening visible at the base or top, indicating complete enclosure. This type of display is commonly used in museums or decorative installations to protect artifacts while showcasing them. Therefore, the statue and its base are fully enclosed.",

      "question": "Has the statue been transformed into a sleek, metallic 3D figure with a reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue in Image B appears significantly different from typical stone or marble statues. It has a highly polished, mirror-like finish that reflects light and surroundings, suggesting it is made of metal, possibly chrome or stainless steel. The surface captures reflections of the sky, trees, and nearby environment, consistent with a reflective material. Additionally, the contours and edges are sharp and smooth, giving it a modern, sleek appearance compared to traditional sculptural forms. This transformation implies a stylistic or artistic reinterpretation of the original statue, emphasizing a futuristic or surreal aesthetic. Therefore, the statue has indeed been rendered as a metallic, reflective 3D figure.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small-scale trees with translucent or semi-transparent leaves surrounding the metallic figure inside the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the glass dome in Image B, several small trees are visible around the base of the metallic statue. These trees have leaves that appear unusually bright and almost luminous, with a translucent or frosted quality, suggesting they are not natural foliage but rather artificial or stylized representations. Their leaves resemble crystal or glass, allowing light to pass through them, which creates a surreal, ethereal effect. Such design choices are often seen in artistic installations to evoke fantasy or otherworldliness. Given their appearance and placement, these are clearly small-scale, non-natural trees with translucent leaves, enhancing the curated nature of the scene.",

      "question": "Are there additional small engraved plaques with historical text visible on the base of the miniature scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the structure beneath the glass dome in Image B features multiple small rectangular plaques arranged around its circumference. These plaques are dark-colored with gold or yellow inscriptions, resembling engraved text. While the exact content is not legible, their style and placement suggest they contain historical or commemorative information, similar to those found on monuments. The presence of multiple plaques—more than one—indicates an intentional addition of contextual or narrative detail to the installation. This contrasts with typical single-plaque memorials and supports the idea of a curated, multi-layered presentation. Thus, additional engraved plaques with historical text are visible.",

      "question": "Does the stand beneath the glass dome feature a polished stone surface with delicate vine patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stand supporting the glass dome in Image B is made of a white, marbled material with a polished finish, giving it a refined and elegant appearance. On the surface of this stand, particularly near the bottom edge, there are thin, branching designs resembling vines or plant tendrils. These patterns are integrated into the stone and appear to be either carved or inlaid, adding an organic decorative element to the otherwise structured form. The combination of polished stone and delicate vine motifs suggests a blend of natural and architectural aesthetics, common in artistic or symbolic installations. Therefore, the stand does feature a polished stone surface with delicate vine patterns.",
