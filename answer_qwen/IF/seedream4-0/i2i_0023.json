      "question": "Has the photo been converted into a minimalist flat illustration-style sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image displays a stylized version of a photograph where all elements—such as the boy and birds—are rendered in a simplified, cartoon-like manner with bold outlines and solid color fills. The art style is consistent with flat illustrations commonly used in stickers or digital icons. There are no gradients, shadows, or complex textures that would suggest a realistic depiction. Instead, the design uses clean lines and uniform colors, which aligns with minimalist flat illustration principles. This transformation from a real-life photo to a graphic representation supports the conclusion that it has been converted into a sticker-style illustration.",

      "question": "Are the boy and all bird outlines clearly present in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each figure—the boy and the four birds—is distinctly outlined with a clear black border. These outlines separate the subjects from the background and define their shapes precisely. Even small details like the feathers, beaks, and facial features are enclosed within these boundaries. The clarity of the outlines ensures that each element remains visually distinct and identifiable, confirming that all figures have well-defined perimeters.",

      "question": "Have block colors been used for the boy's skin tones and the birds' feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration employs solid, flat colors without shading or texture. The boy’s skin tone is uniformly colored with a single shade of peach, and there are no gradients or highlights. Similarly, the birds’ feathers use consistent blocks of color—such as green and yellow for the macaw, white for the cockatoo, blue for the budgie, and yellow for the canary—without any variation in hue or tone. This technique is characteristic of block coloring used in flat design illustrations.",

      "question": "Is the background completely removed from the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is not visible; instead, it shows a checkerboard pattern, which is a standard indicator in graphic software (like Photoshop or GIMP) that signifies transparency. This means the original background has been erased or masked out. Since no background elements remain, and the subject is isolated on a transparent layer, we can conclude that the background has been fully removed.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the boy’s head been slightly enlarged and the birds shrunk to achieve a neatly arranged composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the proportions, the boy’s head appears larger relative to his body than in typical photographic proportions. In real life, heads are proportionally smaller compared to the torso, but here the head seems exaggeratedly large. Additionally, the birds appear smaller and more compact than they would in reality, especially when considering their actual size relative to the boy. This adjustment suggests intentional scaling to create a balanced, cartoonish composition where the face is emphasized and the surrounding elements are downsized for visual harmony.",

      "question": "Has a thick white outline been added around the boy and birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection, there is a noticeable white border surrounding the entire figure, including the boy and all birds. This white outline is consistent in thickness and runs along the outer edge of the black line art, giving the appearance of a cut-out sticker. This feature is common in digital stickers to simulate a physical die-cut effect. The presence of this white stroke confirms that such an outline has been added.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B displays a checkerboard pattern, which is universally recognized in digital imaging as a representation of transparency. This pattern indicates that the background pixels have been removed or made invisible, allowing the image to be placed over any other background without interference. Therefore, the image does indeed have a transparent background.",
