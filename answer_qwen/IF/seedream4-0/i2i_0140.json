      "question": "Does the image display a soft hand-painted texture characteristic of watercolor illustrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image exhibits visual characteristics typical of watercolor illustrations, such as soft edges, translucent layers, and gentle color transitions. The overall appearance lacks sharp digital lines or crisp contrasts, which are common in photographic images. Instead, there is a diffused quality to the forms and colors, especially noticeable in the walls, bedding, and shadows, suggesting a painted effect. This softness aligns with the traditional qualities of watercolor art, where pigments blend on paper and create subtle gradients. Additionally, the presence of faint color bleed and irregular outlines further supports the interpretation that this is a hand-painted or digitally emulated watercolor style.",

      "question": "Are the bedding patterns from the original image preserved in the watercolor illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bedding patterns—particularly the star-shaped quilt blocks with floral motifs—are still recognizable despite the artistic transformation. While the edges of the patterns appear softer and slightly blurred due to the watercolor effect, the core geometric structure and color arrangement remain consistent with the original design. For instance, the alternating red, green, yellow, and white sections form similar star-like shapes as seen in the original photograph. The preservation of these repeating elements indicates that the underlying pattern has been maintained even though it's rendered in a painterly style. Comparing with Image A, the layout and motif repetition are nearly identical, confirming that the pattern integrity was retained during the conversion process.",

      "question": "Do the colors in the image exhibit a soft blending typical of watercolor paintings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the colors in Image B demonstrate the hallmark soft blending found in watercolor paintings. Unlike the sharp boundaries present in the original photo (Image A), the hues in the watercolor version flow into one another, especially visible in the transition between the wall color and the bed frames, as well as within the quilted patterns. For example, the pink and teal accents on the pillows show gradual tonal shifts rather than abrupt changes. Furthermore, areas like the floor and shadows have a diffused, wash-like quality, where colors merge naturally without hard edges. This technique mimics how watercolors behave when applied to paper—pigments spread and mix with water, creating seamless gradients. Such effects are absent in the original image, which features more defined and saturated tones.",

      "question": "Are there visible brush stroke textures or subtle variations in shading throughout the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection, Image B reveals subtle textural elements suggestive of brush strokes and uneven pigment application, which are hallmarks of watercolor techniques. These include slight variations in tone across flat surfaces—such as the wall, nightstand, and bed frame—that resemble the natural inconsistencies introduced by a paintbrush. Additionally, some areas show faint directional streaks or speckled highlights, particularly around the edges of objects and in shadow regions, indicating simulated brushwork. While not every detail has pronounced texture, the overall surface quality lacks uniformity, implying intentional artistic rendering. In contrast, Image A displays smooth, digitally consistent surfaces with no such textural variation, reinforcing that the added imperfections in Image B are part of the watercolor simulation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Can detailed designs in the bedding, like the star patterns, still be clearly seen after conversion to the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the artistic transformation into a watercolor style, the intricate star patterns on the quilts remain largely legible. Each star motif retains its central point and radiating segments, allowing viewers to identify them even with softened edges. Although the fine details such as small floral prints within the stars are somewhat muted due to color diffusion, the overall geometric structure is preserved. The symmetry and placement of these patterns match those in the original image, ensuring continuity. Moreover, the use of contrasting colors—like yellow centers against red or blue backgrounds—helps maintain visual distinction, making the patterns discernible despite the artistic overlay. Thus, while not as sharp as in the photograph, the key design elements are still identifiable.",
