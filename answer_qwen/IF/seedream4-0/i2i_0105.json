      "question": "Has the character been redesigned in a chibi-style soft vinyl figurine format?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B exhibits key characteristics of a chibi-style design, including an oversized head relative to the body, large round eyes, simplified facial features, and a proportionally smaller torso and limbs. These are hallmarks of the chibi art style commonly used in collectible vinyl figures such as Funko Pop! or similar lines. The material appears to be smooth and matte, consistent with soft vinyl used in such collectibles. The red and gold armor is recognizable as Iron Man’s suit but stylized into a more cartoonish, adorable form. This aligns with the typical transformation of characters into chibi formats for toy production.",

      "question": "Is the chibi-style figurine placed inside a transparent display box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the figurine encased within a clear, rectangular enclosure made of transparent plastic or acrylic. The box has clean edges and allows full visibility of the figure from multiple angles, which is standard for collectible display cases designed to protect and showcase limited-edition figures. The transparency ensures that the details of the figurine remain visible while preventing dust and damage. This type of packaging is common in premium collectible releases.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the display case in Image B is visible and features a silver-gray color with a diamond plate pattern embossed on its surface. This textured design mimics industrial metal flooring, often seen in display stands for collectibles to give a rugged, high-quality aesthetic. The base also includes small rivet-like details at the corners, reinforcing the metallic industrial theme. This matches the description of a silver-gray metallic texture platform.",

      "question": "Is the glowing chest core of the figure retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central arc reactor on the chest of the figurine emits a bright blue-white light, indicating that it is illuminated. This glowing effect is a signature element of Iron Man's suit, representing the power source. The presence of this glow confirms that the iconic chest core feature has been preserved in the figurine design, even in its stylized form. Such lighting effects are often included in premium collectible figures to enhance realism and appeal.",

      "question": "Does the overall style of the figurine reflect a cute and minimalistic aesthetic, with no unnecessary details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B displays a highly stylized, simplified design characteristic of chibi aesthetics. It features exaggerated proportions (large head, small body), minimal facial details (simple smile, dot-like eyes), and smooth surfaces without intricate mechanical textures found in realistic depictions. While the armor retains basic color and shape cues from Iron Man’s suit, complex paneling, joints, and weapon systems are omitted. This simplification supports a cute and minimalistic look, prioritizing charm over technical accuracy. Therefore, the design adheres to a minimalist and adorable visual language typical of chibi collectibles.",
