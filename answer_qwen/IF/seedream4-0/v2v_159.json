      "question": "Have the shoes been increased in size while keeping their original design intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoes appear larger and more three-dimensional compared to typical real-world proportions. However, upon close inspection, the design elements—such as the color blocks, laces, stitching lines, and overall shape—are preserved and consistent with the original design seen in Image A. The increase in size is evident from the relative scale of the shoes compared to the legs and background elements, but no new design features or distortions are introduced. This suggests that the shoes have been scaled up while maintaining their original design integrity.",

      "question": "Do the legs appear more cartoon-like compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs have a smoother, more uniform texture and lack visible fabric details like wrinkles or seams that would suggest realistic clothing. The pants appear glossy and simplified, resembling plastic or rubber material rather than cloth. In contrast, Image A shows pants with creases and folds that give a more natural, textile-like appearance. The exaggerated smoothness and rounded forms in Image B contribute to a stylized, cartoonish aesthetic. Therefore, the legs in Image B do appear more cartoon-like than those in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the feet placed on a shelf shaped like clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet are resting on a flat, rectangular platform that resembles a shelf. This shelf is not shaped like clouds; instead, it has clean geometric edges and appears to be made of a solid material, possibly white plastic or ceramic. While the background contains cloud-like elements, the shelf itself is distinctly non-cloud-shaped. In contrast, Image A shows the feet directly on a cloud-like surface, which blends into the sky. Thus, the presence of a shelf in Image B contradicts the idea of cloud-shaped support.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall appearance of the legs and shoes reflect a bobblehead-style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A bobblehead-style transformation typically involves exaggerated proportions, such as oversized heads or limbs, and a rigid, toy-like quality. In Image B, the legs and shoes are rendered with smooth, rounded surfaces and a uniform material appearance, giving them a toy-like or sculptural feel. However, there is no indication of an oversized head or neck, nor does the figure exhibit the characteristic flexibility or articulation of a bobblehead. Instead, the style leans more toward 3D modeling or product visualization rather than a full bobblehead transformation. While the aesthetic is stylized, it does not fully meet the criteria for a bobblehead-style representation.",

      "question": "Do the shoes still maintain their original design details after being resized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shoes in Image B retain all key design elements from the original: the same color scheme (beige and cream), lace configuration, paneling, and sole structure. Even though they appear larger and more voluminous due to scaling, the proportions between components remain consistent with the original design. There are no added textures, missing parts, or distorted features that would suggest a loss of detail. The resizing seems to be a uniform scale-up without altering the underlying design language. Therefore, despite the change in size, the original design details are preserved.",
