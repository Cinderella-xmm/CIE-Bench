      "question": "Does the image show a Hippo and Rabbit standing side by side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two stylized animal figures are clearly visible: one resembling a hippopotamus and the other a rabbit. Both are upright and positioned next to each other on a grassy surface within a framed display. The hippo is on the left, and the rabbit is on the right, with both facing forward. Their postures suggest they are standing side by side in a symmetrical arrangement. This is consistent with the visual representation of characters in collectible or game-style cards, where companions are often displayed together. Based on this observation and common design conventions for such illustrations, it is accurate to conclude that the hippo and rabbit are standing side by side.",

      "question": "Is the image rendered in a 3D cartoon style with gentle lighting and cozy tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B have smooth, rounded forms with soft shading and highlights, typical of 3D cartoon or chibi-style rendering. The lighting appears soft and diffused, casting subtle shadows without harsh contrasts, contributing to a warm and inviting atmosphere. The color palette includes muted earth tones, pastel pinks on the rabbitâ€™s cheeks, and gentle greens in the background, all of which align with 'cozy' aesthetics. These stylistic choices are commonly found in animated children's media or collectible digital art, reinforcing the impression of a 3D cartoon rendering with gentle lighting and cozy tones.",

      "question": "Are there visible stats or skill bars included in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, several horizontal bars labeled 'Skill1', 'Skill2', 'Skill3', 'Patile', and 'Patisiencs' (likely misspellings of 'Patience') are visible. These bars have different colors and numerical values such as '+x', '+8', and '+10'. This format is characteristic of character stat displays in video games or trading card designs, where attributes are quantified. Therefore, based on the visual elements present, it is evident that the image includes visible stats or skill bars.",

      "question": "Is there a title banner at the top and a nameplate at the bottom of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, there is a golden ribbon-style banner with text that reads '5leatt Nino JHorte', which serves as a title or team name. At the bottom, there is a decorative plaque with the text 'Team Resr', functioning as a nameplate. These elements are standard in collectible card or character showcase designs, where titles and labels identify the group or theme. The presence of both a top banner and a bottom nameplate confirms the structure described in the question.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

The dominant colors are various shades of green, brown, and earthy tones, consistent with a nature-inspired setting. The lighting enhances the richness of these colors, creating depth and warmth. This aligns with the typical aesthetic of nature-themed digital art or game environments, confirming that the backdrop is indeed nature-inspired with earthy greens and rich tones.",
