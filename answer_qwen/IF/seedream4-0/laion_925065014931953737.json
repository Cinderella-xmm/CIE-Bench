      "question": "Does the edited image depict the character with an oversized head and small, stubby limbs characteristic of chibi style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a stylized version of Superman with a disproportionately large head compared to the body, which is a hallmark of the chibi art style. The limbs are short and simplified, lacking detailed musculature or proportionality seen in realistic depictions. This exaggerated head-to-body ratio and simplified anatomy align with common chibi design principles, where characters are rendered in a cute, cartoonish manner. The visual cues—such as the large round eyes, small facial features, and compact limbs—support this conclusion. In contrast, real-life depictions of Superman (like in Image A) maintain anatomical proportions typical of human figures. Therefore, based on these visual characteristics and knowledge of chibi art conventions, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Is the character wearing a version of the iconic Superman suit with a visible red cape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the character is clearly dressed in a costume resembling Superman’s classic outfit. The suit includes a blue bodysuit with a red 'S' emblem on the chest, red boots, and a flowing red cape draped over the shoulders. These elements are consistent with the traditional Superman uniform. The cape is distinctly visible, extending from the back and sides, reinforcing its presence. While the design is simplified and stylized, it retains the core components of the iconic suit. Comparing this to Image A, where the live-action Superman also wears a red cape, confirms that the cape is a key feature preserved in both versions. Thus, despite the stylization, the red cape is indeed present.",

      "question": "Is the \"S\" symbol on the chest clearly visible and rendered in bright primary colors (red, blue, yellow)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'S' symbol on the chest of the character in the edited image is prominently displayed. It is outlined in red, filled with yellow, and set against a blue background, which corresponds exactly to the traditional color scheme of Superman's emblem. The colors are vivid and distinct, with high contrast that makes the symbol easily recognizable. This use of bright primary colors—red, yellow, and blue—is standard for Superman’s logo across media. Even though the image is stylized, the color choice remains faithful to the original design. In comparison to Image A, where the 'S' shield has a more metallic and textured appearance but still uses similar colors, the edited version simplifies the palette into brighter, more saturated tones. Hence, the symbol is clearly visible and uses the expected primary colors.",

      "question": "Are the dominant colors of the character's suit and cape vibrant shades of blue and red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a character whose suit is predominantly blue with red accents, including the cape, boots, and the 'S' emblem border. The blue is a deep, rich shade, while the red is bright and saturated, contributing to a visually striking contrast. These colors are not muted or desaturated; instead, they appear vivid and eye-catching, typical of stylized superhero merchandise. This aligns with the established color palette of Superman’s costume. When compared to Image A, where the suit has a darker, more realistic tone due to lighting and material texture, the edited version enhances the vibrancy for aesthetic appeal. However, the fundamental color scheme—blue and red—remains consistent. Therefore, the dominant colors are indeed vibrant shades of blue and red.",

      "question": "Does the character have thick black outlines around its body, face, and costume elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays bold, dark lines outlining the entire figure, including the head, limbs, torso, and costume details such as the cape, boots, and 'S' emblem. These outlines are uniformly thick and serve to define the shape of the character clearly against the background. This technique is commonly used in cartoon and chibi-style illustrations to enhance visibility and give a graphic, toy-like appearance. Such outlines are absent in Image A, where the character is depicted with natural shading and no artificial borders. The presence of these strong black lines is a deliberate stylistic choice in the edited image, emphasizing its nature as a simplified, illustrative representation rather than a photorealistic one. Therefore, the character does have thick black outlines.",

      "question": "Does the edited image appear flat and compact, consistent with the appearance of a fridge magnet rather than a full-sized figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a two-dimensional, stylized figure with no depth or three-dimensional modeling. It lacks shadows, perspective, or volume that would suggest a physical form. Instead, it has a smooth, uniform surface with a defined edge, resembling a sticker or magnet. The way it adheres to what appears to be a metallic surface (likely a refrigerator door) further supports the interpretation that it is a flat object designed for display. This contrasts sharply with Image A, which depicts a full-bodied, three-dimensional human figure standing in a real-world environment with natural lighting and depth. The flatness, lack of depth cues, and context of attachment to a surface all indicate that the edited image represents a fridge magnet. Therefore, the appearance is consistent with that of a compact, flat decorative item.",
