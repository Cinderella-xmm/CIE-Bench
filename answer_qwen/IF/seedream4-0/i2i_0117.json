      "question": "Is there a high-tech robot depicted next to the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a humanoid robot is clearly visible standing beside the character on the rooftop. The robot has a sleek, metallic design with glowing blue lights on its head and joints, which are typical visual cues of advanced technology. Its structure includes articulated limbs and a torso with panels that resemble circuitry or digital interfaces. These features align with common depictions of high-tech robots in science fiction, especially those seen in futuristic or cyberpunk settings. The presence of such design elements strongly indicates that it is a high-tech robot.",

      "question": "Does the scene show the character standing on the rooftop of a skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character is positioned on a flat, elevated surface with railings and structural elements typical of a building's roof. Below this platform, the cityscape extends downward with tall buildings, suggesting a significant height. The perspective shows the character looking over the city from an elevated vantage point, consistent with being on a rooftop. Additionally, the angle of the surrounding structures and the distance to the ground below reinforce the idea that this is a high-rise building. This aligns with common visual representations of rooftops in urban environments, particularly in cinematic or dramatic scenes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features towering skyscrapers illuminated with neon lights in vibrant colors like blue, pink, and purple. These lights appear to be part of digital displays or architectural lighting, which are hallmarks of futuristic or cyberpunk cityscapes. The buildings have sleek, angular designs with glowing vertical lines and data-like patterns, suggesting advanced technology integrated into the architecture. Such visual elements are commonly associated with futuristic urban environments, as seen in films or games set in dystopian or technologically advanced futures.",

      "question": "Is the scene clearly set during nighttime?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in the background is dark, indicating the absence of daylight. The city is lit by artificial lights—neon signs, building illuminations, and streetlights—which are typically prominent at night. The contrast between the dark sky and the brightly lit cityscape further confirms that the scene takes place at night. In addition, the visibility of stars or faint atmospheric glow suggests a nocturnal setting. These visual cues are consistent with nighttime urban environments, especially in cinematic portrayals of cities at night.",

      "question": "Is there a visible indication that the character is taking a photo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character is holding a small rectangular device in their right hand, positioned at eye level, similar to how one would hold a smartphone or camera to take a picture. The device displays a bright screen, suggesting it is active and possibly capturing an image. The character’s posture—standing upright with the device aimed forward—supports the interpretation that they are photographing something, likely the robot or the cityscape. This action is reinforced by the context of the scene, where the character and robot are together on a rooftop, a common setting for capturing scenic views. This behavior aligns with real-world photography practices.",
