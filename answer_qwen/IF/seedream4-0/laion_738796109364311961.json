      "question": "Has the image been transformed into a cartoon-inspired illustration style with exaggerated features and bold lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) displays clear visual characteristics of a cartoon or animated style. The figures have simplified, stylized proportions, with bold outlines and flat color fills typical of comic book or animated illustrations. The facial features are exaggerated—such as large eyes and defined jawlines—and the overall rendering lacks photorealistic textures like skin pores or fabric wrinkles. The background also uses bright, saturated colors and simplified shapes, reinforcing the cartoon aesthetic. These elements align with common traits of cartoon-inspired art, especially in sports-themed collectibles or graphic novels. This contrasts sharply with the photographic realism of Image A.",

      "question": "Are the player’s muscles visibly enlarged and exaggerated compared to realistic proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both players exhibit highly defined and oversized musculature, particularly noticeable in the arms, shoulders, and legs. The biceps, triceps, and quadriceps appear significantly larger than anatomically accurate proportions, which is a common stylistic choice in cartoon or action-figure depictions to emphasize strength and heroism. In contrast, Image A shows athletes with natural, realistic body proportions consistent with actual human physiology. The exaggeration in Image B serves an artistic purpose, enhancing the dramatic effect typical of illustrated sports characters.",

      "question": "Have the uniform colors been intensified to appear more vibrant and saturated than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reds and whites of the uniforms are noticeably more vivid and saturated than in Image A. The red jersey has a brighter, almost glowing hue, and the white elements appear cleaner and more luminous, lacking the subtle shadows and tonal variations seen in the photograph. This heightened saturation is characteristic of cartoon illustrations, where colors are often amplified for visual impact. Additionally, the yellow accents on the white jersey are more pronounced and contrast sharply with the background, further indicating intentional color enhancement.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the team’s logo prominently displayed and emphasized on both the helmet and jersey in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logos are clearly visible and stylistically emphasized. On the red helmet, the 'W' logo (representing Washington State) is rendered with sharp edges and high contrast, making it stand out. Similarly, the 'U' logo on the black helmet (likely representing California) is bold and prominent. Both logos are placed centrally and feature enhanced detailing compared to their real-world counterparts. While the logos in Image A are also present, they are smaller and less stylized due to the photo's realistic nature. The editing process in Image B amplifies these symbols to enhance brand identity and visual appeal, typical in collectible-style artwork.",

      "question": "Has the background been replaced with a stylized depiction of a roaring crowd and football field, consistent with a cartoon sports card?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B has been entirely reimagined into a cartoonish scene featuring a cheering crowd with exaggerated expressions—wide-open mouths, raised fists, and dynamic poses—common in animated depictions of sports excitement. The stadium seating and field markings are simplified and stylized, using bright colors and bold lines. This contrasts with Image A, where the background is a blurred, realistic crowd captured during an actual game. The transformation in Image B aligns with the design language of sports trading cards or animated sports media, aiming to evoke energy and drama.",

      "question": "Is the edited image presented within or as part of a sleek, matte black collector’s box with a transparent lid, allowing visibility of the cards inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large, rectangular black box with a transparent top appears beneath the two players, suggesting that the illustrated scene is either printed on or contained within a collectible card display case. The box has clean, sharp edges and a glossy finish, resembling a premium collector’s item. Inside the box, faint outlines of other cards are visible, implying this is part of a set. This element is not present in Image A, which is a straightforward photograph without any packaging. The inclusion of the box in Image B strongly suggests it is styled as a product shot for a collectible card series, enhancing its commercial and artistic presentation.",
