      "question": "Does the edited image use a whimsical, playful visual style consistent with a children's treasure map?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a background resembling aged parchment, complete with decorative elements such as colorful trees, fantasy creatures (like dragons and mythical birds), and a winding path marked with stars. These visual cues are characteristic of a children's treasure map, which typically uses imaginative and fantastical elements to create an engaging narrative. The overall aesthetic is intentionally playful and cartoonish, designed to evoke a sense of adventure and exploration. This aligns with common design principles used in children's media, where whimsy and imagination are prioritized over realism.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all major sections (e.g., Homepage, Products & Solutions) represented by fun, thematic icons instead of text labels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the edited image, it is clear that while some sections like 'Homepage' are represented by a castle icon (a thematic choice fitting the treasure map motif), other sections such as 'Products & Solutions', 'About Us', and 'Events & Resources' are still labeled with text rather than being replaced entirely by icons. Although there are thematic elements like dragons or trees near certain areas, the primary navigation labels remain textual. Therefore, not all major sections are represented solely by icons; the transformation is primarily stylistic rather than symbolic substitution.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the connections between sections represented by winding, non-linear journey trails instead of straight lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the pathways connecting different sections are depicted as curving, orange-colored trails that resemble roads on a fantasy map. These trails wind through the layout, mimicking the appearance of a treasure hunt route, rather than using straight lines. This departure from the linear structure seen in traditional site maps emphasizes the playful, exploratory theme. The non-linear nature of these paths reinforces the idea of a journey, consistent with a treasure map’s design language.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible decorative elements such as colorful trees, mystical creatures, or other fantasy-themed illustrations placed along the paths or around the map?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image contains numerous decorative elements that enhance its fantasy theme. There are vibrant, multicolored trees (yellow, red, blue, purple) scattered around the map, along with various mythical creatures such as dragons, griffins, and winged animals positioned along the winding paths. These elements are not just background details but are integrated into the visual storytelling, contributing to the whimsical atmosphere. Such decorations are typical of children's treasure maps, where fantasy imagery adds to the sense of wonder and adventure.",

      "question": "Are the colors used in the image bold and vibrant, and is the text rendered in a dynamic, storybook-style font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette of the edited image is indeed bold and vibrant, featuring bright oranges, yellows, blues, purples, and greens. These saturated hues contribute to the energetic and playful tone suitable for a children's audience. Additionally, the text uses a stylized, rounded font with a slightly uneven baseline and decorative flourishes, reminiscent of fonts commonly found in children's storybooks or fantasy games. This combination of vivid colors and whimsical typography supports the overall narrative-driven design.",

      "question": "Is the hierarchical structure of the original site map preserved despite the transformation into a treasure map style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the artistic transformation into a treasure map style, the hierarchical structure of the original site map remains intact. The main sections—such as 'Homepage', 'Products & Solutions', 'About Us', 'Events & Resources', etc.—are still clearly organized in a tree-like structure, with sub-sections branching off logically. The nesting of content (e.g., 'Product #1' under 'Products') follows the same logical flow as in the original, even though the connectors are now winding paths. The site map key also preserves the level hierarchy, indicating that each tier corresponds to a specific depth in the website structure. Thus, while the visual style has changed dramatically, the underlying information architecture is faithfully maintained.",
