      "question": "Are the surfaces of the cabin and surrounding landscape rendered with visible, dappled brushstrokes instead of smooth, photorealistic textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual texture of the cabin and surrounding landscape is distinctly characterized by thick, textured strokes that resemble oil paint application. These brushstrokes are visible across all surfaces—such as the wooden logs of the cabin, the snow on the roof, and the ground—creating a dappled, uneven surface quality. This contrasts sharply with the smooth, seamless textures typical of photorealistic images. The use of impasto-like techniques and visible layering of paint suggests an artistic rendering style rather than photographic realism. Based on these visual cues and knowledge of painting techniques, it is clear that the image employs expressive brushwork.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image softened and blended, with reduced contrast and no sharp edges between color areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B features warm yellows, oranges, and soft blues, which are gently blended together, especially noticeable in the sky and tree foliage. There is a lack of sharp transitions between hues, and edges appear diffused rather than crisp. For example, the boundaries between the snow-covered trees and the sky are softly merged, and the light emanating from the windows blends into the surrounding environment without abrupt demarcations. This softness and blending are hallmarks of impressionistic or painterly styles, where color harmony and mood take precedence over precise detail. Compared to high-contrast, sharp-edged digital renderings, this image clearly exhibits reduced contrast and smooth color gradients.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the surrounding fir trees depicted with loose, expressive brushstrokes and enhanced or non-naturalistic coloration compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fir trees are rendered using broad, dynamic brushstrokes that emphasize form and movement rather than botanical accuracy. Their green tones are interspersed with patches of purple, blue, and yellow, suggesting an artistic interpretation rather than naturalistic representation. These color choices enhance the emotional tone of the scene—evoking warmth and vibrancy even in a winter setting. In contrast, such exaggerated or stylized coloring would not typically be seen in a photorealistic depiction. The looseness of the strokes and the vivid, non-literal coloration align with expressive painting techniques, indicating a deliberate departure from realistic portrayal.",

      "question": "Is the smoke from the chimney rendered as a soft, blurred plume with indistinct edges, suggesting motion and warmth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smoke rising from the chimney in Image B is depicted with a diffuse, swirling form composed of blended purples, pinks, and whites. Its edges are not sharp or defined but instead fade gradually into the background sky, creating a sense of fluid motion. This soft, ethereal appearance conveys warmth and movement, consistent with how smoke might appear in a painted scene where atmospheric effects are emphasized. Unlike a photorealistic image where smoke might show more distinct particles or structure, here the treatment prioritizes mood and impression over physical precision. Thus, the smoke is clearly rendered as a soft, blurred plume.",

      "question": "Is the ground covered in snow, and are there visible falling snowflakes, maintaining the serene winter setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ground in Image B is clearly covered in white, textured snow, consistent with a winter landscape. Additionally, small white specks are scattered throughout the image, particularly in the air near the cabin and trees, resembling falling snowflakes. These elements contribute to the overall tranquil, wintry atmosphere. While the snowflakes are stylized due to the painting technique, their presence and distribution suggest active snowfall. The combination of snow-covered terrain and airborne particles supports the continuity of the serene winter theme, despite the artistic interpretation.",

      "question": "Are the cabin, chimney, surrounding trees, and snow-covered ground still clearly identifiable and present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the artistic transformation, the core elements of the scene remain unmistakably recognizable. The cabin maintains its A-frame structure, with a visible chimney emitting smoke. The surrounding evergreen trees are positioned symmetrically around the house, and the ground is clearly covered in snow. Even though the forms are softened and abstracted through brushwork, their shapes and spatial relationships are preserved enough to allow for immediate identification. The editing process has altered texture and color but not the fundamental composition or subject matter. Therefore, all key components are still present and identifiable.",
