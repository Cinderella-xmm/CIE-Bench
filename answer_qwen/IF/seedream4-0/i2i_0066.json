      "question": "Has the vase and bouquet been transformed into a 3D printed display model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase and bouquet are presented in a highly uniform, smooth, and monochromatic beige color, consistent with typical 3D-printed objects. The flowers lack natural texture and variation in petal shape and shading that would be expected in real roses, suggesting they are digitally modeled and fabricated. Additionally, the stems are uniformly green and perfectly aligned, which is uncharacteristic of real plant material. The entire composition sits on a flat base with a plaque, further indicating it is a display piece rather than a real floral arrangement. This presentation style aligns with common practices for showcasing 3D-printed models at exhibitions or tech events.",

      "question": "Does the 3D printed model appear to be made of matte material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the vase, flowers, and dog figurine in Image B lacks any reflective shine or glossy finish. Instead, the lighting reveals soft, diffused reflections, and there are no bright specular highlights, which are typical indicators of a matte surface. Matte materials absorb light rather than reflect it directly, resulting in a non-glossy appearance. This visual characteristic is consistent with common 3D printing materials like PLA or resin when finished with a matte coating, often used for aesthetic display models.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a display plaque added at the base of the 3D printed model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of the display base in Image B, there is a rectangular plaque with engraved text. Although the text is not fully legible, its presence and format (a framed label on a dark base) are consistent with informational plaques used in museum exhibits or trade show displays. These plaques typically provide details about the artwork or product being showcased. The inclusion of such a plaque strongly suggests that this model is intended for public display, reinforcing its role as an exhibit piece.",

      "question": "Has the background been set as a tech expo booth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features blue carpeting, large banners with company logos (such as 'TECH'), digital monitors, exhibition booths, and people interacting with displays—common elements of a technology trade show or expo. The layout includes branded panels, information boards, and professional lighting, all of which are typical of such environments. The presence of these elements indicates that the scene has been staged or edited to resemble a tech expo setting, likely to contextualize the 3D-printed model within a technological or innovation-focused environment.",

      "question": "Does the 3D printed model maintain the design of the original vase and bouquet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the vase and bouquet in Image B are stylized, they retain the essential form and structure of a traditional flower arrangement. The vase has a classic silhouette with horizontal ridges, and the bouquet consists of multiple rose-like flowers with layered petals and green stems, closely resembling the general design of a real floral arrangement. However, due to the limitations of 3D printing and artistic interpretation, the details may be simplified or idealized. Nonetheless, the overall design intent—representing a vase of roses—is preserved, even if not perfectly replicated from a real-life version.",
