      "question": "Is the entire body of the truck composed of layered, reflective crystal planes resembling emerald and jade facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck's body is visually constructed from numerous angular, geometric surfaces that reflect light in a way characteristic of cut gemstones. These surfaces display varying shades of green and clear tones, with high reflectivity and internal refraction typical of crystalline materials like emerald or jade. The material appears to be layered into facets, mimicking the look of polished gemstone cuts. Given the visual evidence—such as the sharp edges, light dispersion, and coloration—it is reasonable to conclude that the entire body is designed to resemble layered, reflective crystal planes. This artistic representation aligns with known techniques used in sculptural art involving crystal or glass materials.",

      "question": "Are the wheels transparent and made of quartz with visible internal crystalline patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheels in Image B are highly reflective and translucent, featuring a multi-faceted structure similar to the rest of the vehicle. They exhibit clarity and internal geometric patterns consistent with crystalline materials such as quartz. The transparency allows for light to pass through and refract within the structure, forming star-like or prismatic effects typical of cut crystal. While quartz is not explicitly confirmed, the visual properties—including translucency, faceting, and internal reflections—are strongly indicative of a quartz-like material. Therefore, based on the visual cues and common artistic use of such materials, it is accurate to describe the wheels as transparent and possessing visible internal crystalline patterns.",

      "question": "Is the truck placed on a smooth, white marble platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the truck resting on a flat, elevated surface that is uniformly white with subtle gray veining, characteristic of marble. The surface is highly polished and reflects the underside of the truck, indicating a smooth texture. Marble platforms are commonly used in art installations to elevate and highlight sculptures, especially those made of reflective or precious materials. The visual consistency of the surface—its color, texture, and reflection—matches known examples of white marble. Thus, based on these observations and contextual knowledge of art display practices, the platform can be identified as a smooth, white marble base.",

      "question": "Do the cabin and body surfaces feature angular, faceted crystal planes that reflect and refract light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cabin and body of the truck in Image B are entirely covered in sharply defined, angular surfaces that mimic the geometry of cut crystals. These facets are arranged in a way that maximizes light interaction, causing both reflection and refraction. Light entering the facets creates colorful internal reflections, a hallmark of crystalline materials. The overall design emphasizes geometric precision and optical effects, which are typical of crystal art installations. This is consistent with the appearance of faceted gemstones or crystal sculptures. Therefore, the surfaces clearly feature angular, faceted crystal planes that interact dynamically with light.",

      "question": "Does the crystal truck maintain the original structural proportions and layout of the military truck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A (the original), the crystal version preserves the fundamental structural elements of the military truck: the cab placement, the long cargo body, the wheelbase, and the overall silhouette. Despite being transformed into a crystalline sculpture, the relative positions of components such as the front grille, windows, doors, and axles remain consistent with the original design. The transformation does not distort or alter the proportions; instead, it reinterprets the form using a different material while maintaining fidelity to the original layout. This suggests an intentional artistic preservation of the vehicle’s structural integrity, even in its fantastical form.",
