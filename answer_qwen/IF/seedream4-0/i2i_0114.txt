    "Question": "Q1: Has the original desk and character structure remained unchanged?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central scene of 'The Last Supper' by Leonardo da Vinci is still visible, with Jesus at the center and the twelve apostles seated around a long table. The layout of the figures appears to follow the original composition, with the same number of characters and their relative positions preserved. The table itself maintains its elongated form and placement in the room, consistent with the original painting. Although there are subtle differences in lighting and color saturation, likely due to digital enhancement or restoration effects, the structural arrangement of the desk and characters remains largely unchanged. This conclusion is supported by comparing the spatial relationships and proportions of the figures and the table, which align closely with the known composition of the original artwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Has a modern man been added to the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a figure dressed in contemporary clothing is clearly present on the far right side of the composition. This individual is not part of the original 'Last Supper' scene, which depicts only biblical figures from the 1st century. The presence of a person in modern attire—specifically a tuxedo and bow tie—indicates that this figure has been digitally inserted into the image. The style and context of the figure contrast sharply with the Renaissance-era setting of the original painting, confirming that this is an addition rather than a genuine element of the original artwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the modern man wearing formal attire?",
    "explanation": "The modern man in Image B is dressed in a black tuxedo with a white dress shirt, a black bow tie, and a pocket square. This ensemble is characteristic of formal wear typically worn for events such as galas, weddings, or high-end social gatherings. The precision of the suit's fit and the accessories (bow tie, pocket square) further confirm that the attire is formal. Given that the man is standing confidently and holding a glass, his appearance aligns with the conventions of formal dress in modern Western culture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the modern man raising a glass?",
    "explanation": "The modern man in Image B is depicted holding a wine glass in his right hand, which is raised above shoulder level. His posture and the orientation of the glass suggest he is making a toast or gesture of celebration. This action is consistent with common social behaviors associated with formal events. The glass is transparent and contains a liquid, likely wine, reinforcing the idea of a ceremonial or celebratory act. The visual cues—hand position, angle of the glass, and facial expression—support the interpretation that he is indeed raising the glass.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the modern man placed on the far right empty space of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the modern man is positioned on the far right edge of the composition, adjacent to the wall and outside the main group of figures. In the original painting, the right side of the room does contain some architectural elements but no additional figures beyond the apostles. The area where the modern man stands appears to be an open space in the original work, suggesting it was chosen as a location for insertion without disrupting the central narrative. The placement ensures the man is distinct from the painted figures while still being integrated into the overall frame. Therefore, he occupies what can be described as the far right empty space of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
