      "question": "Are there exactly six chibi-style stickers in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By visually inspecting Image B, we can count the number of distinct sticker-like panels. There are six individual square-shaped frames arranged in a 2x3 grid (two columns and three rows). Each frame contains a chibi-style character or scene, consistent with the definition of a sticker. The layout is uniform and each panel has a white border, reinforcing their identity as separate stickers. Therefore, based on visual evidence and common design patterns for sticker sets, there are exactly six stickers present.",

      "question": "Do the chibi characters in the stickers have oversized, expressive eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all chibi characters exhibit large, round eyes that dominate their facial features—a hallmark of the chibi art style. These eyes are highly expressive, often conveying emotions such as joy, shyness, or affection through size, shape, and placement. This stylistic choice is typical in anime and cartoon illustrations to emphasize emotion and appeal. For example, the girl in the top-left sticker has wide, sparkling eyes, while the boy in the bottom-right has closed eyes with blush marks, indicating emotional expression. This aligns with world knowledge about chibi aesthetics where exaggerated features, especially eyes, are central.",

      "question": "Does the background of the stickers feature warm, earthy tones along with subtle stars or confetti?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the backgrounds within each sticker in Image B reveals consistent use of warm, earthy color palettes—such as beige, light brown, and soft orange—commonly associated with outdoor or pastoral settings. Additionally, decorative elements like small white stars and faint pink or yellow confetti are visible in multiple stickers, particularly in the top-left, top-right, and bottom-right panels. These embellishments enhance the whimsical and cheerful tone typical of chibi art. The combination of warm colors and festive details supports the conclusion that the background features both warm tones and subtle sparkle effects.",

      "question": "Is the aspect ratio of the edited image 9:16?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the aspect ratio, we assess the dimensions of Image B. The image is vertically oriented, with a tall rectangular shape that suggests a mobile-friendly format. The arrangement of six stickers in a 2x3 grid implies a height greater than width. Measuring visually or by standard proportions, the image appears to be approximately twice as tall as it is wide, which corresponds to a 9:16 aspect ratio—a common dimension for smartphone screens and vertical social media posts. This is further supported by the way the stickers are stacked without distortion, fitting neatly into this vertical layout.",

      "question": "Is the rider’s shirt depicted in a chibi style and retains the beige color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters wear shirts that match the beige color seen in the original photo (Image A), confirming continuity in clothing. The shirts are stylized with simplified lines and minimal detail, consistent with chibi art conventions. Despite the exaggeration of features like heads and eyes, the shirt's color and basic form (button-up, long sleeves) remain recognizable. This preservation of color and style indicates intentional design continuity between the real-life subject and its animated representation. Thus, the rider’s shirt is both chibi-styled and retains the beige hue.",
