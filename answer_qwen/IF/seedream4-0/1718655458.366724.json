      "question": "Are all spheres and cubes replaced with LEGO brick shapes that retain the original marbled patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects are clearly constructed from LEGO-like bricks, which are rectangular in shape and feature studs on top—distinctly different from the spherical and cubic forms seen in Image A. However, the marbled patterns (white with brown veining) present in the original spheres and cubes in Image A are preserved in the LEGO bricks, suggesting a stylistic continuity. The transformation is not merely a change in form but also an attempt to maintain visual consistency through pattern retention. Therefore, while the geometric forms have changed from spheres and cubes to LEGO bricks, the marbled texture has been retained. This indicates a successful translation of aesthetic elements despite the structural shift.",

      "question": "Do all LEGO bricks have a matte surface texture without reflective highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the LEGO bricks exhibit a smooth surface with subtle reflections, particularly visible on the white and marbled sections. These reflections suggest a semi-gloss or slightly polished finish rather than a fully matte texture. While the overall appearance is clean and minimalistic, the presence of soft highlights—especially on the curved edges and studs—indicates some level of reflectivity. In contrast, typical matte surfaces would absorb light more uniformly and lack such specular highlights. Therefore, the bricks do not possess a purely matte texture.",

      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks arranged in an orderly, structured pattern on a wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stack of LEGO bricks arranged in a stepped, tiered formation, resembling a small architectural structure. The arrangement is symmetrical and follows a clear geometric progression, indicating deliberate order and structure. The bricks are placed on a wooden shelf, which is visible beneath them and provides a stable base. This setup contrasts with the chaotic, scattered layout of spheres and fragments in Image A. The use of a wooden shelf and the precise stacking suggest a minimalist, curated presentation. Thus, both the arrangement and the setting support the conclusion that the bricks are organized in an orderly manner.",

      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks display subtle interlocking details such as studs or recessed connectors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO bricks in Image B clearly show raised circular studs on their top surfaces, which are characteristic features of LEGO pieces. These studs are evenly spaced and aligned, consistent with standard LEGO design. Additionally, the sides of some bricks appear to have recessed areas that would allow for interlocking with other pieces. These details are essential for the functional design of LEGO bricks and are visible here, even though they are stylized with marbled textures. The presence of these features confirms that the bricks are designed with interlocking mechanisms, aligning with real-world LEGO construction principles.",

      "question": "Is the background simplified into a clean, uniform, and uncluttered minimalist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a plain, light-colored wall behind the LEGO structure, with no visible patterns, textures, or distractions. The lighting is even and soft, contributing to a calm and neutral atmosphere. The wooden shelf adds a natural element but does not detract from the simplicity of the scene. Compared to Image A, which has a dynamic, blurred background with floating particles and complex depth cues, Image B's background is starkly minimalistic. The focus is entirely on the LEGO structure, emphasizing clarity and simplicity. This aligns with minimalist design principles, where unnecessary elements are removed to highlight the subject.",
