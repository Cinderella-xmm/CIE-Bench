      "question": "Is the edited image presented as a series of separate postcard-sized panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) presents a single, cohesive composition featuring a girl playing the violin in a paper-cut art style. There are no visible borders, seams, or divisions that would suggest it is composed of multiple separate postcard-sized panels. The entire scene appears unified, with consistent lighting, texture, and depth across the frame. The background is a continuous textured surface resembling cream-colored paper, and all elements—including the girl, violin, music notes, and candlestick—are integrated into one seamless artwork. Based on visual cues and common knowledge about postcards, which typically have defined edges and often appear in collections, this image does not resemble a series of separate panels. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Does the girl’s blouse feature intricate lace details rendered in a paper-cut style with sharp, layered edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's blouse displays detailed lace patterns around the collar and cuffs. These details are characterized by sharp, angular cuts and layered appearances, consistent with paper-cut art techniques. The design mimics traditional lacework but is stylized to resemble folded or layered paper, with visible shadows and depth suggesting physical layers. This aligns with the overall aesthetic of the image, which emulates three-dimensional paper sculptures. In contrast to realistic fabric textures, these elements are geometrically precise and lack soft gradients, reinforcing the paper-cut interpretation. Thus, the blouse features lace details rendered in a paper-cut style with sharp, layered edges.",

      "question": "Has the violin been enlarged in size relative to the girl's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the proportions in Image B, the violin appears to be scaled appropriately for a young girl. Its size is consistent with a standard full-size violin, which is proportionate to the girl’s height and arm span. The instrument fits comfortably under her chin and is held with both hands in a natural playing position. There is no visual distortion or exaggeration in its dimensions compared to her body. In contrast, if the violin were enlarged, it would appear disproportionately large, possibly extending beyond her reach or altering the balance of the composition. Since the violin maintains realistic proportions within the stylized context, it has not been enlarged.",

      "question": "Does the girl’s pose show an enhanced sense of musical expression through refined hand placement, posture, or facial focus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The girl’s pose in Image B reflects a deliberate and expressive stance typical of someone deeply engaged in music. Her head is slightly tilted downward, eyes gently closed or focused, conveying concentration and emotional immersion. Her left hand is positioned precisely on the fingerboard, suggesting accurate fingering, while her right hand holds the bow in a poised manner, ready to draw sound. The posture is upright yet relaxed, indicating confidence and control. Additionally, the subtle tilt of her head and the alignment of her body with the violin enhance the sense of musical engagement. These elements—facial expression, hand placement, and posture—collectively contribute to a refined depiction of musical expression, even within the stylized paper-cut medium.",

      "question": "Does the image have a visual appearance consistent with being printed on textured cream stock (e.g., warm off-white tone, soft matte finish)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B exhibits a uniform, warm off-white tone with a subtle grainy texture that resembles high-quality textured paper, such as cream stock. The surface lacks reflective highlights, suggesting a soft matte finish rather than a glossy one. This texture extends uniformly across the backdrop and subtly interacts with the shadows cast by the paper-cut elements, enhancing the illusion of depth. The color palette is muted and harmonious, consistent with materials used in fine art prints or artisanal postcards. Given these visual characteristics—warm tone, matte surface, and tactile texture—the image strongly resembles something printed on textured cream stock.",

      "question": "Are the back sides of the postcards illustrated with blank music sheet motifs suitable for writing notes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image provided (Image B) shows only the front side of the artwork, depicting the girl playing the violin. There is no indication of any reverse side or back panel. While the background includes faint musical notes as part of the decorative design, these are integrated into the front-facing composition and do not suggest a separate backside. Furthermore, there is no visual evidence of blank areas or layouts designed for writing notes. The question implies a multi-panel or postcard format with functional backsides, but the current image does not display such features. Without additional information or views of the reverse, we cannot confirm the presence of blank music sheets on the back. Therefore, based solely on the visible content, the answer is 'No'.",
