        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear exhibits a distinct geometric structure composed of flat, polygonal surfaces rather than smooth, rounded forms. This is characteristic of a low-poly 3D modeling style, where objects are represented using fewer polygons to create a stylized, angular look. The bear's face, limbs, and body all consist of visible facets, especially noticeable in the triangular and quadrilateral shapes forming its features. This contrasts with realistic or high-poly models that use many small polygons to simulate smooth surfaces. Based on these visual cues and knowledge of 3D modeling techniques, it is clear that the teddy bear has been rendered in a faceted low-poly style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motorcycle in Image B also displays a faceted, low-poly aesthetic. Its components—such as the fuel tank, headlight, handlebars, wheels, and engine—are constructed from flat, angular surfaces rather than smooth, curved ones. For example, the headlight is no longer a rounded glass lens but a multi-faceted shape, and the chrome parts appear segmented into geometric planes. This simplification of form aligns with low-poly rendering, which emphasizes sharp edges and minimal polygon count for a stylized effect. This is consistent with the overall artistic choice seen in the image, reinforcing the low-poly theme across all elements.",

      "question": "Is the scenic background rendered in a low-poly style while still being recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B includes a mountain (resembling Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio de Janeiro) and surrounding landscape. These elements are rendered using simplified, angular geometry typical of low-poly art. The mountain’s surface is composed of large, flat polygons with sharp edges, and the vegetation and distant buildings are abstracted into basic shapes. Despite this stylization, the iconic silhouette of the mountain remains identifiable due to its distinctive shape and relative position. This demonstrates that the low-poly rendering preserves key visual features necessary for recognition, even though details are reduced. Therefore, the background is both stylized and recognizable.",

      "question": "Has the teddy bear retained its original pose and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To assess whether the teddy bear has retained its original pose and position, we compare it to Image A. In Image A, the teddy bear sits upright on the motorcycle, facing forward, with arms gripping the handlebars and legs positioned naturally over the foot pegs. In Image B, the bear maintains the same seated posture, orientation, and placement on the motorcycle. Although the bear’s surface geometry is now low-poly, its overall spatial positioning and limb articulation remain consistent with the original. There is no indication of movement, rotation, or repositioning. Thus, despite the stylistic change, the pose and position are preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the motorcycle in both images shares the same general design: a classic cruiser-style bike with a round headlight, chrome fenders, a prominent engine block, and dual exhaust pipes. In Image B, although the motorcycle is rendered in a low-poly style, its structural layout—such as the placement of the handlebars, seat, wheels, and engine—is unchanged. The spatial relationship between the motorcycle and the teddy bear remains identical, indicating no shift in position. While the visual texture and surface detail are altered by the low-poly rendering, the core design and orientation are preserved. Therefore, the motorcycle retains its original design and position despite the stylistic transformation.",
