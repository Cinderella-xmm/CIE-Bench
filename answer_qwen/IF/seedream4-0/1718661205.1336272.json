      "question": "Is the military ship constructed entirely from LEGO bricks, with visible brick patterns and modular construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the military ship is clearly made of LEGO bricks. The surface of the ship displays a grid-like pattern characteristic of LEGO construction, with visible studs and interlocking pieces. The structure is modular, with distinct sections such as the superstructure, gun turrets, and deck elements that are typical of LEGO models. These features align with known LEGO design principles where components are assembled in a blocky, interlocking manner. The overall appearance lacks smooth surfaces or continuous materials, confirming it is built from LEGO bricks.",

      "question": "Are the ocean waves depicted using blue LEGO bricks, forming a textured surface resembling water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ocean in Image B is represented by blue LEGO baseplates arranged in a way that mimics water. White LEGO pieces are used to simulate wave crests, adding texture and depth. This method is consistent with how LEGO dioramas often depict water—using blue bricks for the surface and white or translucent pieces for foam and waves. The arrangement creates a stylized but recognizable representation of ocean waves, relying on the modular nature of LEGO bricks.",

      "question": "Is the boat’s deck composed of small, detailed LEGO accessories such as railings, panels, or equipment that replicate real deck features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The deck of the LEGO ship in Image B includes various small details such as railings, hatches, and equipment like antennas and cannons. These elements are constructed from LEGO parts designed to mimic real-world naval features. For example, the railings are made of thin LEGO pieces placed along the edges, and there are panel-like structures on the deck. These accessories are typical in LEGO military models, which aim to replicate functional details of real ships using modular components.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the life vest and shirt replaced with LEGO-textured clothing that retains their original colors but has a blocky, brick-like appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The minifigure in Image B wears a brown vest and a white shirt, both of which are standard LEGO minifigure clothing items. While the colors match those typically seen in real-life attire, the texture is inherently blocky due to the nature of LEGO printing and part design. However, these clothes are not 'replaced' with a new material; they are original LEGO parts with printed details. The appearance is not a transformation of real fabric into LEGO texture but rather the use of pre-designed LEGO clothing. Therefore, while the look is blocky, it is not a replacement of real clothing with a LEGO-textured version.",

      "question": "Is the LEGO diorama positioned on a minimalist shelf with a clean, uncluttered background that highlights the model's details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO diorama in Image B is placed on a white shelf with a plain, light-colored wall behind it. There are no visible distractions or clutter in the background, allowing the focus to remain on the model. The lighting is even, and the composition emphasizes the details of the LEGO ship and its surroundings. This setup reflects a minimalist presentation style commonly used to showcase collectibles or models without visual interference.",
