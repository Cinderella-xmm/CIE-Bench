      "question": "Are the kimono and fox mask rendered with sharp geometric shapes and angular lines characteristic of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono features a pattern composed of sharp, angular lines and geometric forms such as triangles and zigzags, which are hallmarks of Art Deco design. The color scheme includes deep reds, pale pinks, and metallic silver accents, further reinforcing this aesthetic. The fox mask also incorporates angular elements—especially in the forehead design, which is a stylized red geometric motif resembling a symmetrical abstract shape. These elements align with the Art Deco style’s emphasis on symmetry, bold geometry, and modernist abstraction. Therefore, based on visual cues and knowledge of Art Deco characteristics (e.g., use of symmetry, geometric patterns, and luxurious materials), the rendering does reflect Art Deco influence.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the outlines and internal details of both the kimono and the fox mask feature prominent bold lines and angular geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kimono in Image B displays bold, clearly defined lines forming sharp angles and repeating geometric patterns. The internal details include intersecting diagonal and linear motifs that emphasize structure and precision. Similarly, the fox mask has strong, angular contours around the eyes and forehead, with a central red emblem made of pointed, symmetrical shapes. The whiskers and ear interiors also follow clean, sharp lines rather than soft curves. This contrasts with more organic or flowing designs seen in traditional Japanese art. The use of bold lines and angularity is consistent across both garments and accessories, indicating a deliberate stylistic choice toward geometric clarity. Based on these observations and knowledge of design principles where boldness and angularity define modernist aesthetics, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Have the floral patterns on the kimono been replaced with simplified, abstract, and stylized motifs rather than realistic flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono no longer features naturalistic floral patterns. Instead, it showcases a series of abstract, geometric shapes including triangles, chevrons, and parallel lines arranged in a repetitive, symmetrical fashion. These forms are highly stylized and lack the organic curves and petal structures typical of traditional floral designs. This shift from realism to abstraction is consistent with Art Deco tendencies to simplify nature into symbolic, geometric representations. Comparing this to traditional kimonos, which often depict cherry blossoms or chrysanthemums in realistic detail, the current design clearly replaces those with modern, abstract motifs. Thus, the transformation reflects a move away from realism toward stylization.",

      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image deep reds, pale pinks, and metallic tones (such as silver or gold)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kimono in Image B prominently features deep red as the primary background color, accented with pale pink and white geometric patterns. Metallic silver lines are visible within the design, adding a reflective quality that enhances the Art Deco feel. These colors—deep red, soft pink, and metallic sheen—are commonly associated with luxury and modern elegance in Art Deco aesthetics. The fox mask also uses white and red, with the red motif having a glossy, almost metallic finish. There is no presence of gold, but silver is clearly present. Given that 'metallic tones' include silver, and the combination of deep red, pale pink, and silver dominates the palette, the description matches the visual evidence. Therefore, the color scheme aligns with the stated criteria.",

      "question": "Is the overall composition symmetrically balanced, with harmonious alignment between the kimono and mask, and do the textures appear refined and unified?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B exhibits strong bilateral symmetry: the kimono's pattern mirrors itself along the central axis, and the fox mask is perfectly symmetrical in shape and decoration. The red central motif on the mask aligns vertically with the center of the kimono, creating a cohesive visual line. The textures of both the kimono and mask appear smooth and polished, suggesting high-quality material finishes. The geometric patterns on the kimono and the structured design of the mask share similar visual language—sharp lines, clean edges, and orderly repetition—which contributes to a unified aesthetic. This harmony between form, texture, and symmetry supports a refined and intentional artistic composition. Drawing from design principles, symmetry and texture cohesion are key indicators of balance and refinement, which are evident here.",

      "question": "Are the silhouette and proportions of the person’s body, kimono, and mask preserved and harmonized despite the stylistic transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouette of the individual remains intact—shoulders, torso, and head are proportionally aligned and maintain natural human proportions. The kimono drapes appropriately over the body, following traditional garment structure while incorporating new patterns. The fox mask fits snugly and aligns with facial features without distorting the head shape. Although the design style has shifted to an Art Deco-inspired aesthetic, the underlying anatomy and garment fit remain anatomically plausible and visually coherent. The mask’s size and placement respect facial symmetry and do not exaggerate or misalign with the person’s features. Thus, even with the stylized patterns and bold lines, the overall form and proportion are preserved and harmonized. This balance between stylistic innovation and structural fidelity indicates careful design execution.",
