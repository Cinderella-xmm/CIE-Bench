      "question": "Is the mango depicted with visible pixelation characteristic of 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango exhibits a distinct blocky and jagged appearance, particularly along its edges and surface gradients. This visual effect is consistent with pixelation, where individual pixels are visibly large and not smoothly blended. The color transitions on the mango are abrupt rather than gradual, which is typical of low-resolution digital art or 8-bit graphics that use limited pixel density. Additionally, the outline of the mango has sharp, angular breaks, further indicating pixelation. These characteristics align with the visual style of 8-bit graphics, where images are rendered using a grid of discrete pixels without anti-aliasing. Based on these observations, it can be concluded that the mango is indeed depicted with visible pixelation.",

      "question": "Are the table and napkin rendered with a simplified, low-resolution appearance consistent with 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The table and napkin in Image B display noticeable pixelation and lack fine detail. The wood grain on the table appears as broad, repetitive blocks of color rather than continuous, natural patterns, which is indicative of low resolution. Similarly, the napkin’s texture, which should have subtle folds and creases, is reduced to simple geometric shapes with minimal variation. The edges of the napkin are sharply defined with jagged lines, reinforcing the low-resolution aesthetic. These features—blocky textures, simplified forms, and lack of fine detail—are hallmarks of 8-bit graphics. Thus, both the table and napkin are rendered in a manner consistent with this retro graphical style.",

      "question": "Does the image utilize a limited color palette typical of 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a restricted range of colors compared to what would be expected in a high-resolution photograph. The mango is composed of only a few shades of yellow and orange, with no smooth gradient or nuanced variation. The table is rendered in flat tones of brown and tan, lacking the depth and variation seen in natural wood. The napkin is primarily white with minimal shading, and shadows are represented by a single dark tone. This limited use of color, especially the absence of intermediate hues and soft transitions, is characteristic of 8-bit graphics, which historically used only 256 colors due to hardware constraints. Therefore, the image employs a limited color palette consistent with 8-bit design principles.",

      "question": "Are shadows and highlights on the mango and table simplified to match the flat shading typical of 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting effects such as shadows and highlights are highly stylized and lack subtlety. The shadow cast by the mango is a solid, uniform dark shape without gradation, suggesting a flat shading technique. Similarly, the highlight on the mango is a single bright area without a smooth transition into the surrounding surface. The same applies to the table, where light and shadow are divided into distinct blocks rather than blending naturally. This approach avoids realistic lighting modeling and instead uses bold, flat areas of color—hallmarks of 8-bit graphics, which often rely on dithering or simple shading to simulate depth. Thus, the rendering of light and shadow is simplified and matches the flat shading style typical of 8-bit visuals.",

      "question": "Is the overall composition of the image simplified, focusing on basic shapes and forms rather than detailed textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of Image B emphasizes simple geometric forms over intricate details. The mango is rendered as a smooth oval with minimal surface texture, ignoring the natural blemishes and pores found on real fruit. The napkin is folded into basic triangular and angular shapes without realistic fabric wrinkles. The table is a flat plane with a repetitive pattern of stripes, devoid of fine wood grain or natural imperfections. Even the background chair is reduced to a basic wooden frame with no ornate details. This simplification of forms and omission of textures is consistent with the design philosophy of 8-bit graphics, which prioritize clarity and efficiency over realism. Therefore, the overall composition is indeed simplified, focusing on fundamental shapes and forms.",
