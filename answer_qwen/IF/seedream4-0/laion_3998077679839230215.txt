    "Question": "Q1: Are there exactly six separate chibi-style illustrations, each depicting one of the specified elements (blouse, lehenga, dupatta, jewelry, bangles, background)?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, we observe a collection of nine magnets arranged in a 3x3 grid. However, only six of these magnets represent distinct chibi-style illustrations related to traditional Indian attire and accessories. Specifically, there are: (1) a purple blouse with embroidery; (2) a red dupatta; (3) a lehenga with floral patterns; (4) a figure wearing jewelry; (5) a pair of silver bangles; and (6) a decorative wall pattern. The remaining three magnets depict cartoon figures in various outfits but do not represent unique standalone elements like 'jewelry' or 'bangles' as individual items—some overlap in representation. For example, multiple magnets show stylized female figures in traditional wear, which may include jewelry or clothing but are not isolated depictions. Thus, while some elements are present, they are not all uniquely represented as separate illustrations. The count exceeds six distinct representations when including duplicates or composite figures. Therefore, the condition of 'exactly six separate chibi-style illustrations' is not met.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do all six magnets exhibit a vibrant, glossy surface with visible reflections or shine?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the magnets appear to be made of a smooth, possibly plastic or enamel material that reflects light. Each magnet shows highlights and subtle reflections, particularly noticeable on the curved surfaces and edges, suggesting a glossy finish. For instance, the red circular magnets with bangles have bright specular highlights, indicating a polished surface. Similarly, the chibi-style figures and clothing designs also display consistent sheen across their surfaces. This visual cue, combined with common knowledge about fridge magnets (especially collectible ones), supports the idea that they are designed to have a shiny, vibrant appearance for aesthetic appeal. All nine magnets in the image demonstrate this characteristic, so even if only six are considered relevant, they all share this quality. Hence, the answer is affirmative.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do all six magnets have clearly rounded edges instead of sharp corners?",
    "explanation": "Observing the shapes of the magnets in Image B, it is evident that all of them—regardless of shape—are designed with smooth, curved edges. The circular magnets (e.g., those with bangles or chibi faces) naturally have rounded edges. The rectangular or irregularly shaped magnets (such as the blouse or lehenga) also feature soft, rounded corners rather than sharp angles. This design choice is typical for safety and aesthetic reasons in collectible magnets. Even though some magnets have intricate details, their overall form maintains rounded contours. Since the question refers to 'all six magnets,' and based on visual inspection, every magnet in the set exhibits rounded edges, the answer aligns with this observation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does each of the six magnets accurately depict one of the following: the embellished purple blouse, the intricate lehenga with floral patterns, the red dupatta, the traditional jewelry, the silver bangles, or the ornate background wall pattern?",
    "explanation": "To evaluate this, we examine each of the six relevant magnets: (1) One magnet clearly shows a purple blouse with detailed embroidery, matching the description. (2) Another depicts a full lehenga with floral and paisley-like patterns, consistent with the original outfit's design. (3) A third features a red dupatta with silver trim, accurately representing the dupatta from the original attire. (4) Several magnets show figures wearing necklaces and earrings, which constitute traditional jewelry. (5) Two circular red magnets display stacked silver bangles, directly corresponding to the described element. (6) One magnet includes a background with an ornate damask-like pattern, resembling the wallpaper seen in Image A. While some magnets combine multiple elements (e.g., a figure wearing both jewelry and a sari), each still visually represents at least one of the listed components. Given that the question allows for accurate depiction—even if not exclusive—the six magnets collectively cover all six categories. Therefore, the answer is yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the six magnets rendered in a chibi art style, featuring exaggerated proportions such as large heads and simplified facial features?",
    "explanation": "Chibi art style is characterized by oversized heads, small bodies, simplified facial expressions (often with dot eyes and minimal mouths), and cute, stylized proportions. In Image B, most of the illustrated figures (especially the female characters) exhibit these traits: large round heads, tiny arms and legs, simple facial features, and rosy cheeks. Even the non-human-shaped magnets (like the blouse or bangles) are presented in a cartoonish, stylized manner consistent with chibi aesthetics. However, the two bangle magnets are purely symbolic and lack human features entirely. Yet, since the question asks whether the *magnets* are rendered in chibi style, and given that the majority of them (the character-based ones) clearly follow chibi conventions, and the others are stylized representations within the same thematic universe, it can be reasonably concluded that the entire set adheres to the chibi art style. The stylistic consistency across all magnets supports this interpretation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are the six magnets displayed as individual, standalone items arranged in a way that suggests they are part of a collectible set, rather than a single composite image?",
    "explanation": "The magnets in Image B are physically separated, each occupying its own space on what appears to be a refrigerator surface. They are arranged in a neat grid formation, which is typical for collectible sets. Each magnet has distinct boundaries and does not merge into the others, indicating they are independent objects. Additionally, their uniform size, glossy finish, and thematic coherence (all related to Indian attire and culture) suggest they are part of a curated collection. There is no visual evidence of blending or overlapping that would imply a single composite image. Instead, the layout and presentation strongly indicate they are intended to be collected and displayed individually. Therefore, the arrangement supports the idea of a collectible set.",
    "answer": "Yes"
