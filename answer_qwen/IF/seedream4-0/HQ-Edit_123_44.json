      "question": "Is the aircraft rendered in a stylized 3D model form rather than a photorealistic representation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The aircraft in Image B appears to be a highly detailed 3D rendering, but it maintains a strong sense of realism in terms of lighting, texture, and shadowing. The surface details such as panel lines, rivets, and reflections suggest a high-fidelity digital model designed to mimic photorealism. While some elements like the clouds inside the case are clearly artificial, the aircraft itself is not stylized in a cartoonish or exaggerated way. Instead, it is rendered with attention to historical accuracy and realistic materials, consistent with photorealistic 3D modeling techniques used in digital art and simulations. Therefore, despite being a digital creation, it is not stylized but rather aims for photorealism.",

      "question": "Is the aircraft fully encased within a glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft is positioned entirely inside a transparent glass enclosure with visible metal framing and a solid base. The glass walls surround the aircraft on all sides, and there is no part of the plane extending outside the structure. This indicates that the aircraft is completely enclosed within the display case, which is designed to protect and showcase it. The visual cues—such as reflections on the glass and the clear boundaries of the case—confirm full encapsulation.",

      "question": "Are there visible worn leather accents on the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base and top edges of the display case in Image B feature brown material with visible creases, discoloration, and texture consistent with aged or worn leather. These leather-like sections are reinforced with brass-colored corner fittings, and their surface shows signs of wear such as scratches and uneven coloration, suggesting intentional aging for aesthetic effect. This matches common design choices in vintage-style display cases, where leather is used for durability and visual appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the display case have brass-colored corner fittings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The corners of the display case in Image B are fitted with metallic hardware that has a golden-yellow hue, consistent with brass or a brass-like alloy. These fittings are prominent at each corner of the case’s frame, providing structural reinforcement and contributing to its antique aesthetic. Their reflective quality and placement align with typical craftsmanship seen in vintage display cases, confirming their presence.",

      "question": "Is there an engraved emblem visible on the front face of the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the front lower portion of the display case, there is a circular emblem featuring wings and a central insignia, resembling a military aviation badge. It is embossed into the leather surface and has a metallic finish, indicating it is either engraved or affixed as a decorative element. The design includes a shield and winged motif, commonly associated with air force or aviation heritage. This emblem is clearly visible and centered on the front face, serving as a symbolic decoration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small, artificial clouds placed inside the glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the base of the display case, beneath the aircraft, there are several white, fluffy formations that resemble clouds. These are clearly not real clouds but are instead sculpted or modeled objects made from a soft material like foam or cotton, designed to simulate a sky scene. They are positioned on a flat surface within the case and appear static, confirming they are artificial props meant to enhance the diorama-like presentation of the aircraft.",

      "question": "Is the aircraft oriented diagonally upward within the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The aircraft inside the display case is tilted such that its nose points upward and to the right (from the viewer's perspective), forming a diagonal angle relative to the base of the case. This orientation gives the impression of ascent or flight, enhancing the dynamic presentation of the model. The wings are angled accordingly, and the propellers are aligned with this upward trajectory, confirming a diagonal upward orientation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do the propellers of the aircraft show visual effects indicating they are spinning (e.g., motion blur or rotational distortion)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The propellers of the aircraft in Image B do not exhibit any visible motion blur or rotational distortion. Each blade is sharply defined and clearly separated, with no blurring or streaking that would indicate movement. In contrast, if the propellers were spinning, one would expect a slight blur or ghosting effect, especially in a still image attempting to convey motion. Since the blades are crisp and stationary-looking, it can be concluded that no visual effects simulating rotation are present.",
