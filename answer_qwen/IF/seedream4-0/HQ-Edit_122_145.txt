    "Question": "Q1: Is the figure depicted in a chibi style with an oversized head, large eyes, and simplified proportions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are stylized cartoon characters with exaggerated features typical of chibi art. These include disproportionately large heads relative to their bodies, large expressive eyes, and simplified facial features and body proportions. The character design is clearly inspired by anime or manga aesthetics, where chibi style is commonly used to depict cute, endearing versions of characters. This visual style emphasizes cuteness and charm through exaggeration, which aligns perfectly with the characteristics described in the question. Based on these visual cues and common knowledge of chibi art conventions, it is evident that the figures are indeed rendered in chibi style.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the floral patterns and bows on the kimono significantly more vibrant and exaggerated in color and size compared to the original?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows four chibi-style figures wearing kimonos with floral patterns and bows. The colors are bright and saturated, featuring bold pinks, yellows, and reds, which stand out vividly against the pastel background. The floral motifs are larger and more stylized than what would typically be seen in realistic depictions of traditional kimonos. In contrast, Image A depicts a more realistic and subdued representation of a kimono with delicate floral patterns and naturalistic color gradients. The bow (obi) in Image A is also proportionally smaller and less ornate. By comparing the two images, it is clear that the floral designs and bows in Image B are intentionally exaggerated for stylistic effect, enhancing visual appeal in a way consistent with chibi art. Therefore, the patterns in Image B are more vibrant and exaggerated than in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are there exactly four separate images of the chibi character, each in a unique pose corresponding to holding a cherry blossom branch, catching petals, gazing at blooming trees, and dancing amidst falling flowers?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are four distinct chibi figures arranged in a 2x2 grid. Each figure has a different pose and interaction with cherry blossoms. The top-left figure holds a cherry blossom branch, the top-right appears to be catching falling petals, the bottom-left has closed eyes and raised hand as if gazing at something above (possibly blooming trees), and the bottom-right is mid-motion, arms outstretched, suggesting a dancing movement among scattered petals. These poses align closely with the described actions: holding a branch, catching petals, gazing at trees, and dancing. While 'gazing at blooming trees' is not explicitly shown (e.g., no visible trees in the frame), the posture suggests contemplative observation, which fits the intent. Given the context and visual interpretation, all four poses match the described scenarios accurately.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does each of the four images depict a clear and distinct action—holding a branch, catching petals, gazing at trees, or dancing—with visible movement or interaction with cherry blossoms?",
    "explanation": "Each of the four chibi figures in Image B displays a clear and distinct action involving cherry blossoms. The first figure actively holds a branch with blossoms, showing direct interaction. The second has hands open toward floating petals, indicating an attempt to catch them. The third has a serene expression with one hand raised, suggesting quiet observation or admiration, possibly of blooming trees. The fourth is in a dynamic pose with arms extended and legs apart, surrounded by falling petals, conveying motion consistent with dancing. All actions involve visible engagement with cherry blossoms, either through physical contact or implied interaction. The use of scattered petals around each figure enhances the sense of movement and seasonal atmosphere. Thus, each image communicates a distinct and coherent action related to cherry blossoms.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the four fridge magnets displayed together on a single pastel-colored surface that appears to be a magnetic sheet?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows four chibi-style figures mounted on a flat, light pink rectangular surface with rounded corners and a hanging tab at the top—typical of packaging for magnetic stickers or fridge magnets. The surface has a subtle texture and uniform color, resembling a magnetic sheet commonly used for displaying collectible items. The figures are evenly spaced and appear affixed to this surface, which serves as a backing card. This presentation is consistent with how fridge magnets are often sold in sets. The pastel color scheme and clean layout further support the idea that this is a commercial product designed for display. Therefore, the evidence strongly indicates that the four images are displayed together on a single pastel-colored magnetic sheet.",
    "answer": "Yes"
