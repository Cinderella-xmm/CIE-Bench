      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a distinct figurine is visible on the right side of the desk. It has exaggerated cartoonish features, including large eyes, a small nose, and a simplified facial structure typical of stylized collectible figures such as Funko Pops or similar vinyl toys. The figure is dressed in a formal black suit with a white shirt and bow tie, standing upright on a black base. These visual characteristics—proportions, style, and material appearance—are consistent with known collectible figurines designed for display. Based on these cues and common knowledge about collectible toys, it is clear that this object is intended to be a decorative collectible figure.",

      "question": "Is the collectible figure placed on a surface suitable for a desk ornament?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The collectible figure is positioned on the top surface of a black desk, which includes drawers and an open space beneath, indicating its use as a functional workspace. Desk surfaces are commonly used for placing decorative items, especially collectibles, due to their visibility and accessibility. The placement is stable and unobtrusive, not blocking any essential functions like keyboard access or monitor placement. Given that desks often serve dual purposes—work and personal expression—it is entirely appropriate to place a collectible figure here. This aligns with typical interior design practices where personal items are displayed on work surfaces.",

      "question": "Does the collectible figure maintain visual harmony with the overall composition of the room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The room in Image B features a minimalist, modern aesthetic with neutral tones—black furniture, light wood flooring, and soft natural lighting. The collectible figure, while stylized, uses a monochrome black-and-white color scheme that matches the furniture and decor. Its placement near the mirror and other objects (keyboard, books) suggests intentional arrangement rather than random clutter. Although the figure's cartoonish style contrasts with the otherwise sleek and realistic design elements, its compact size and cohesive color palette allow it to integrate without disrupting the balance. In interior design, small, contrasting decorative pieces can enhance interest if they don't dominate. Here, the figure adds personality without overwhelming the space, maintaining visual harmony through proportion and color alignment.",

      "question": "Does the collectible figure obscure or overshadow key elements such as the mirror or existing decorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The collectible figure is located on the right side of the desk, near the edge, and is relatively small in scale compared to the large circular mirror above it. The mirror remains fully visible and unobstructed by the figure. Other items on the desk, such as the keyboard and books, are also clearly visible and not blocked. The figure does not dominate the visual field; instead, it occupies a peripheral position. While it draws attention due to its unique form, it does not eclipse or compete with larger focal points like the mirror or the plant. Therefore, based on spatial hierarchy and visual weight distribution, the figure does not obscure or overshadow key elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the collectible figure appear seamlessly integrated into the scene as though it is a natural part of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The collectible figure appears deliberately placed within the scene, suggesting it was included as a deliberate design choice rather than an afterthought. Its position on the desk aligns with typical display habits—near the edge but not in the way—and its color scheme (black and white) complements the surrounding furniture. However, its stylized, toy-like appearance contrasts with the realistic textures and forms of the rest of the room (e.g., the plant, wooden floor, smooth mirror). Despite this contrast, the integration feels intentional, possibly reflecting a personal touch or artistic statement. In interior design, such elements are often accepted as expressive additions when they do not disrupt the overall flow. Since the figure fits well in terms of scale, placement, and color, and doesn’t clash with functionality, it appears to be a natural, albeit distinctive, part of the composition.",
