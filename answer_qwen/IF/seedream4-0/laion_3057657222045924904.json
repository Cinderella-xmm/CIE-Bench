      "question": "Is the McLaren depicted as a highly detailed 3D-rendered model rather than a photographic image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The McLaren in Image B appears to be rendered with a level of precision and consistency typical of high-quality 3D modeling. The reflections on the car's surface are uniform and lack the subtle imperfections (like dust, scratches, or lens flare) commonly seen in real-world photography. Additionally, the lighting is perfectly even, with no natural shadows or ambient occlusion variations that would suggest a physical photograph. The edges are sharp, and the textures—especially on the wheels and body panels—are mathematically precise, indicating digital creation. While it resembles a real car, the flawless symmetry and lack of environmental noise point toward a 3D render rather than a photo.",

      "question": "Is the McLaren enclosed within a transparent acrylic display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the McLaren is clearly positioned inside a clear, rectangular structure with clean edges and reflective surfaces consistent with acrylic or glass. The transparency allows full visibility of the car while creating subtle reflections and refractions around its edges. This casing is mounted on a circular base and functions as a protective enclosure, which is characteristic of an acrylic display case used for showcasing collectibles or models. The clarity and thickness of the material align with standard acrylic display cases used in high-end presentations.",

      "question": "Does the car rest on a polished chrome base that resembles a rotating platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base beneath the display case in Image B is metallic, highly reflective, and has a smooth, circular design with concentric rings and visible screws—typical features of a premium rotating platform. Its polished chrome finish reflects light and surroundings with mirror-like clarity, suggesting it is designed not only for aesthetic appeal but also for mechanical rotation. This setup is common in luxury showrooms or museum displays to allow viewers to see the object from multiple angles. Therefore, it strongly resembles a rotating platform made of polished chrome.",

      "question": "Are subtle carbon fiber textures visible on the interior walls of the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the display case, particularly on the back wall behind the car, there is a distinct pattern resembling carbon fiber weave. This texture is dark gray with a diagonal crisscross pattern, commonly used in automotive interiors and high-performance branding to convey strength and sophistication. The presence of this texture adds depth and realism to the scene, reinforcing the premium nature of the display. Given the context of a luxury vehicle showcase, such materials are frequently incorporated into exhibit design.",

      "question": "Is a miniature toolset containing micro wrenches and screwdrivers visible and neatly arranged inside the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the interior back wall of the display case, just above the car’s rear wheel, there is a small set of tools mounted on a horizontal bar. These include two wrenches and three slender tools resembling screwdrivers, all scaled down proportionally to match the size of the car. They are arranged neatly in a row, mimicking a real workshop setup but at a miniature scale. This detail enhances the theme of precision engineering associated with high-performance vehicles like the McLaren.",

      "question": "Is a laser-etched cityscape silhouette visible around the display case, enhancing the urban aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Flanking both sides of the display case, there are black silhouettes of skyscrapers and buildings forming a city skyline. These appear to be precisely cut or etched into the background surface, likely using laser technology given their clean lines and uniformity. The inclusion of a cityscape adds an urban, modern feel to the presentation, suggesting a metropolitan setting—perhaps referencing major cities where luxury cars are showcased. This decorative element complements the overall sleek and sophisticated design of the exhibit.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire composition in Image B exudes a high-end showroom ambiance. The use of reflective chrome, transparent acrylic, carbon fiber textures, and a minimalist white backdrop with branded text ('MILLER MOTORCARS') all contribute to a luxurious and curated environment. The lighting is soft yet directional, highlighting the car’s contours without harsh shadows, indicative of professional studio lighting. Every element—from the rotating base to the decorative cityscape—is designed with precision and elegance, aligning with the standards of premium automotive exhibitions.",
