    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire lighthouse scene enclosed within a spherical glass or transparent globe?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighthouse and its surrounding rocky island are clearly contained within a large, transparent spherical object that resembles a glass globe. The curvature of the sphere is visible, and reflections and refractions on the surface confirm it is made of a transparent material like glass. The scene inside appears to be scaled down and positioned centrally within this sphere, which acts as a container. This structure is consistent with a snow globe or decorative glass dome, where the entire scene is enclosed. Based on visual cues such as the spherical boundary, light distortion, and containment of the scene, it is evident that the entire lighthouse scene is enclosed within a transparent globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the lighthouse inside the globe depicted as a miniature 3D model rather than a full-scale structure?",
    "explanation": "The lighthouse within the globe in Image B appears significantly smaller than life-sized, consistent with a miniature representation. Its proportions relative to the surrounding rocks and waves suggest scaling down, typical of models used in decorative globes. Additionally, the level of detail and the way the elements are arranged—such as the stylized waves and simplified terrain—support the idea that this is a crafted, three-dimensional model rather than a full-scale depiction. In contrast, if it were a full-scale structure, it would not fit within the confines of the globe. The context of being inside a globe further implies that the scene is a scaled-down, 3D model designed for display.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the waves around the lighthouse inside the globe made of translucent blue resin with a stylized appearance?",
    "explanation": "Inside the globe, the waves are rendered in a highly stylized manner, with smooth, rounded forms and bright blue hues that resemble molded plastic or resin. They lack the chaotic texture of real ocean waves and instead have a polished, almost artificial look, suggesting they are made from a translucent material like resin. Their uniformity and clarity, along with the way they refract light, support this interpretation. Such materials are commonly used in decorative globes to simulate water in a controlled, aesthetic way. Therefore, based on their appearance and material properties inferred from visual cues, the waves are best described as translucent blue resin with a stylized design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the globe rest on a wooden base with an engraved compass rose pattern?",
    "explanation": "The base supporting the globe in Image B is clearly made of wood, identifiable by its grain texture and warm brown color. At the center of the base, there is a distinct engraving featuring a compass rose—a star-like design with directional points, commonly associated with navigation. This symbol is often used decoratively on nautical-themed items, reinforcing the maritime theme of the globe. The presence of both the wooden material and the detailed compass rose engraving confirms that the globe rests on a wooden base with this specific pattern.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are painted clouds and a distant mountain panorama visible in the background behind the globe?",
    "explanation": "Behind the transparent globe in Image B, the background features a painted sky with fluffy white clouds and a distant mountain range, including a prominent snow-capped peak resembling Mount Fuji. These elements appear flat and two-dimensional, consistent with a painted backdrop rather than a real landscape. The colors and brushstroke-like textures suggest artistic rendering, likely intended to enhance the scenic effect of the globe. Since these elements are located outside the globe and do not interact with its internal components (e.g., no reflection or refraction affecting them), they are clearly part of a painted environment placed behind the globe for aesthetic purposes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are the rocks inside the globe rendered in earthy tones (such as browns, tans, and greens) and the water in vibrant shades of blue?",
    "explanation": "Inside the globe, the rocks are depicted in various earthy tones, including browns, tans, and muted greens, consistent with natural stone and moss-covered surfaces. These colors align with realistic geological representations, even though stylized. The water, particularly the wave structures, is rendered in vibrant shades of blue, ranging from deep cobalt to lighter turquoise, giving it a dynamic and eye-catching appearance. This coloration enhances the visual appeal of the scene and is typical of decorative globes that use vivid hues to simulate oceanic environments. Both the rock and water color schemes are consistent with the described characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
