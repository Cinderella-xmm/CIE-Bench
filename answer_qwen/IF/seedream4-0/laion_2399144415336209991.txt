    "Question": "Q1: Is the couple depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated facial features and proportions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the couple is rendered in a stylized, animated form. Their facial features—such as large eyes, simplified nose shapes, and smooth, rounded contours—are characteristic of cartoon or anime-style illustrations. The proportions are also exaggerated: the heads are relatively larger compared to the body, and the limbs are simplified. These visual cues align with common conventions in cartoon art, where realism is sacrificed for expressive appeal. This contrasts with typical photographic realism seen in Image A, which captures natural proportions and subtle facial details. Therefore, based on the visual style and artistic choices, the depiction is clearly cartoon-like.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Has the beadwork on the bride’s gown been enhanced to appear more elaborate or exaggerated than in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the beadwork on the bride’s gown appears more pronounced and stylized. The strands of beads on her shoulder are drawn with greater clarity and density, forming distinct, flowing patterns that emphasize decorative flair. In contrast, Image A shows the beadwork in a more realistic and subtle manner, consistent with actual wedding attire photography. The cartoon version exaggerates these details for visual impact, making them more prominent and intricate than they would appear in real life. This enhancement serves an artistic purpose in animation, where emphasis on detail enhances aesthetic appeal. Thus, the beadwork has been made more elaborate in the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Has the groom’s suit lapel been enlarged to an exaggerated size compared to its original proportion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the groom's suit lapel appears slightly broader and more angular than in typical real-world tailoring. However, when compared to Image A, the lapel width is not dramatically increased—it remains within plausible proportions for a formal suit. While the cartoon style does involve some simplification and stylization (e.g., cleaner lines and less texture), there is no significant enlargement or distortion of the lapel that would qualify as 'exaggerated' in scale. Realistic suits have lapels of standard width, and while the animated version may emphasize them slightly, they do not deviate enough from normal proportions to be considered exaggerated. Therefore, the lapel has not been significantly altered in size.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are there three distinct scenes showing the couple holding hands, toasting, and dancing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are two heart-shaped frames visible—one in the upper left and one in the lower right. The upper-left frame shows the couple holding hands, while the lower-right frame depicts them toasting with champagne glasses. There is no scene showing the couple dancing. The main central image shows them embracing, but this is not counted as a separate scene. Thus, only two scenes are present: holding hands and toasting. The third scene—dancing—is absent. Therefore, the claim of three distinct scenes is false.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is each of the three scenes enclosed in a heart-shaped border with a gold trim?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains two heart-shaped frames, both of which have a gold trim. The upper-left and lower-right insets are clearly outlined with ornate golden borders shaped like hearts. However, since there are only two such framed scenes and not three (as implied by the question), the statement about 'each of the three scenes' being enclosed in such a border is incorrect. Even if the main central image were considered a 'scene,' it is not enclosed in a heart-shaped border. Therefore, the condition fails due to the mismatch in number and framing.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q6: Is each framed scene placed on a cream-colored background featuring floral engravings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both heart-shaped frames are set against a cream-colored backdrop. This background includes faint floral engravings or patterns, particularly visible near the edges and corners. These designs are subtle but consistent with traditional wedding-themed aesthetics. The entire composition rests on this textured cream surface, which serves as a unifying element across the illustration. Given that both framed scenes are indeed on this same background with floral motifs, the description matches the visual content. Thus, the answer is affirmative.",
    "answer": "Yes"
