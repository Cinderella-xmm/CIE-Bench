      "question": "Is there a classic LEGO-style minifigure present in the edited image?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small human-like figure is visible next to the LEGO elephant. This figure has a yellow head with printed facial features, a torso with a red backpack, brown legs, and articulated armsâ€”characteristic traits of a classic LEGO minifigure. The proportions, color scheme, and design elements (such as the blocky limbs and head) align perfectly with the standard LEGO minifigure style. Based on visual cues and world knowledge about LEGO products, this confirms the presence of a LEGO-style minifigure.",

      "question": "Does the elephant in the edited image feature earthy hues accented with a rich red tone similar to the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in Image B is constructed from LEGO bricks primarily in shades of brown, which are earthy tones consistent with natural elephant skin. Additionally, several red LEGO pieces are used to accentuate parts of the elephant's body, such as its back and legs. These red accents match the color of the backpack worn by the minifigure and the red backpack in Image A, suggesting a deliberate color coordination. Therefore, the elephant does feature earthy hues with a rich red accent.",

      "question": "Is the scene encased within a transparent glass cube in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO elephant and minifigure displayed inside a clear, box-shaped enclosure with visible glass panels and metallic edges. This structure is consistent with a transparent glass display case or cube, commonly used for showcasing collectible models. The reflections and transparency of the material confirm it is made of glass or a similar transparent material, and the overall shape is cubic. Thus, the scene is indeed encased within a transparent glass cube.",

      "question": "Does the miniature rest on a matte black base with silver details in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO model is mounted on a rectangular base that appears to be matte black in color. On the front of this base, there is a silver-colored plaque with engraved text. Additionally, small silver-colored fasteners or decorative elements are visible at the corners of the base, contributing to the 'silver details' described. This combination of a matte black surface and metallic silver accents matches the description provided. Therefore, the miniature rests on a matte black base with silver details.",

      "question": "Is there an engraved nameplate on the base reading \"African Elephant\" with biological classification information beneath in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the front of the base in Image B, there is a silver plaque with engraved text. The top line clearly reads 'African Elephant'. Below it, smaller text is visible, including what appears to be scientific classification information such as 'Biological: Loxodonta africana', followed by additional Latin or technical terms. This matches the description of a nameplate with both the common name and biological classification. Given the clarity of the text and typical presentation in museum-style displays, this confirms the presence of such a nameplate.",
