    "Question": "Q1: Is the figure now a chibi-style bust with an oversized head and simplified body proportions, suitable for tabletop display?",
    "explanation": "The figure in Image B exhibits characteristics typical of chibi-style design, which is known for its exaggerated proportions, particularly an oversized head relative to the body. The head is significantly larger than the torso, and the limbs are short and simplified, consistent with chibi aesthetics. Additionally, the figure is mounted on a wooden base, suggesting it is designed as a collectible or decorative bust intended for tabletop display. This aligns with common practices in figurine design where stylized characters are produced for display purposes. Therefore, based on visual cues such as head-to-body ratio, simplification of anatomy, and mounting, it can be concluded that the figure is indeed a chibi-style bust.",

    "explanation": "The pomegranate held by the figure in Image B has a smooth, shiny surface with visible highlights and reflections, particularly near the top where light appears to strike it.

    "explanation": "The face of the figure in Image B is characterized by large, round eyes with solid black pupils, a small curved mouth, and simple, clean lines defining the cheeks and jawline. These features are typical of minimalist and cartoonish design styles, especially in chibi art, where facial details are reduced to essential elements for expressive impact. The contours are soft and rounded, lacking sharp angles or complex shading, which enhances the cute and stylized aesthetic. This contrasts with realistic depictions that would include finer details like eyelashes, subtle shadows, or skin texture. Therefore, the facial design is indeed minimalistic and simplified.",
