      "question": "Is the original fruit platter photo used as the centerpiece without significant alterations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fruit platter in Image B appears visually identical to the one in Image A, with the same arrangement of fruits: pineapple chunks, kiwi slices, green apple slices, watermelon wedges, orange segments, banana slices, and blueberries. The composition, lighting, and colors of the fruit are consistent with the original image. There is no visible distortion, resizing, or repositioning of the fruit elements that would suggest significant alterations. Therefore, it can be concluded that the original fruit platter was used as the centerpiece with minimal to no changes.",

      "question": "Have decorative green leaf graphics been added around the fruit platter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are stylized green leaf graphics placed at the corners and sides of the imageâ€”specifically, large monstera-like leaves in the bottom corners and smaller leaf clusters near the top and sides. These elements are not present in Image A, which has a plain white background. These leaves appear digitally added and serve a decorative purpose, enhancing the tropical and fresh theme of the image. This indicates that decorative graphics have indeed been introduced.",

      "question": "Does the image reflect a ready-to-eat supermarket packaging style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Ready-to-eat supermarket packaging typically includes clear plastic containers, labels, nutritional information, barcodes, and branding. Image B does not feature any such elements. Instead, it presents an artistic, promotional-style layout with a gradient background and decorative foliage. While it may resemble a health-focused food advertisement, it lacks the practical packaging features like transparent containers or product labeling. Thus, it does not reflect a typical supermarket packaging style.",

      "question": "Is the background styled with a light green gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a background that transitions from a lighter green at the center to a slightly darker green toward the edges, creating a soft gradient effect. This is clearly different from Image A, which has a plain white background. The use of a light green gradient enhances the fresh, natural aesthetic of the image and complements the theme of vitamin-rich fruits. Based on visual cues and common design practices for health-related imagery, this gradient is intentional and stylistic.",

      "question": "Are the details and colors of the original fruit platter preserved accurately in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the fruit platter maintains its original appearance in terms of color vibrancy, texture, and arrangement. The pineapple remains bright yellow, the watermelon is vivid red with green rind, the oranges are orange, and the blueberries are deep blue. There is no noticeable color distortion or loss of detail. The editing process appears to have focused on adding background elements and text rather than altering the fruit itself. Therefore, the original details and colors are preserved accurately.",
