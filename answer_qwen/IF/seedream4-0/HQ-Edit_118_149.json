      "question": "Is the ballet dancer's pose represented as two distinct sticker versions in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two separate figures of a ballet dancer are visible on the surface of a journal. Both figures are in similar poses—executing a high leg extension (à la seconde) while en pointe—but they differ in size and artistic style. One is larger and more prominent, while the other is smaller and positioned to the left. Each figure appears to be a sticker due to its clean white outline and flat appearance against the background. The visual cues such as consistent proportions, clear borders, and placement suggest that these are two distinct sticker representations of the same pose. This aligns with the concept of 'distinct sticker versions'—they are not identical but variations of the same subject. Therefore, based on visual evidence and common understanding of stickers as layered, detachable designs, it is reasonable to conclude that the pose is indeed represented as two distinct sticker versions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does one of the stickers use a pastel color scheme with soft gradients and gentle tones to convey grace?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the smaller sticker on the left side of Image B, its color palette consists of light pinks, creams, and subtle beige tones, which are characteristic of a pastel color scheme. These colors are applied with smooth transitions and soft shading, suggesting gentle gradients rather than sharp contrasts. Such a visual treatment is often used in art to evoke delicacy and elegance—qualities associated with ballet. The overall aesthetic of this sticker leans toward softness and subtlety, reinforcing the idea of grace. In contrast, the larger sticker uses more angular, fragmented shapes with sharper tonal shifts, which does not emphasize softness. Therefore, the smaller sticker aligns with the description of using a pastel color scheme with soft gradients to convey grace.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does one of the stickers feature sharp geometric lines and angular forms to create a modern aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The larger sticker on the right side of Image B displays a highly stylized representation of the dancer composed of numerous triangular and polygonal shapes. These forms are connected by sharp, straight edges, creating a faceted, almost crystalline appearance. This design approach is characteristic of low-poly or geometric art styles, which are known for their modern, abstract look. The use of angular segments across the body, limbs, and clothing emphasizes structure and form over realism, contributing to a contemporary aesthetic. This contrasts with the softer, more fluid rendering of the smaller sticker. Thus, based on the visual evidence of sharp angles and segmented geometry, the larger sticker clearly features a modern, geometric design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible detachable or segmented sections around the dancer's leg in at least one of the stickers to enable dynamic layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the larger sticker, the dancer’s leg is composed of multiple polygonal segments that appear to be separated by white outlines, giving the impression of modular or detachable parts. Additionally, there are loose triangular pieces floating near the larger figure, particularly around the lower leg and torso area. These floating elements suggest that the design may allow for reconfiguration or layering—implying interactivity or modularity. While these elements are not physically detached in the image, their visual separation and placement imply that they could be designed as removable or repositionable components. This supports the idea of dynamic layering. The smaller sticker does not show such segmentation. Therefore, the presence of these segmented and seemingly detachable parts in the larger sticker indicates that dynamic layering is a feature of at least one sticker.",

      "question": "Are both stickers placed on a beige-colored journal with a smooth, sleek appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two stickers affixed to a closed notebook or journal. The surface of the journal is uniformly beige in color, with a matte finish that reflects light subtly, indicating a smooth texture. There are no visible textures like fabric or embossing, supporting the description of a sleek appearance. The spine of the journal is visible on the left, showing a consistent material and color. Both stickers are adhered directly onto this surface, and there is no indication of any other background or object beneath them. Based on the visual cues—the uniform color, lack of texture, and clean presentation—it is evident that the stickers are placed on a beige-colored journal with a smooth, sleek appearance.",
