      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the stack of tires reshaped into a creature resembling an armadillo with a segmented, armored back made from the tire treads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is clearly a mechanical creature designed to resemble an armadillo. The body is composed of multiple segments that mimic the appearance of armor plating, and these segments are constructed using materials that resemble tire treads—specifically, the textured patterns on the tires are used to form the segmented back. This design choice integrates the original tread pattern into the creature’s shell, giving it a rugged, protective look similar to an armadillo's natural armor. The visual cues such as the layered, interlocking segments and the texture closely match the structure of a real armadillo’s carapace. Therefore, the tires have been repurposed not just as wheels but as structural elements forming the armored back.",

      "question": "Are there visible metallic joints located within the openings between the tires, suggesting mechanical articulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are visible metallic components connecting the tires to the main body of the creature. These include articulated suspension systems and pivot points that appear to allow movement. Specifically, the areas where the tires meet the chassis feature brass-colored metalwork and cylindrical joints, which resemble mechanical hinges or shock absorbers. These components suggest that the tires can move independently, indicating potential for articulation. While the 'openings between the tires' may not be explicitly shown as gaps with joints, the presence of these mechanical linkages implies mobility and articulation. Thus, based on the visible hardware, the creature includes mechanical joints that support movement.",

      "question": "Have the central wheel hubs been replaced with glowing mechanical eyes that emit light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front portion of the creature features two bright blue circular lights positioned where the face would be. These lights are embedded in a mechanical assembly that resembles eyes and are located near the front of the vehicle-like head. However, these glowing elements are not located at the center of any wheel hub. Instead, they are part of the head structure and are separate from the tire assemblies. The wheel hubs themselves remain intact and do not contain glowing components. Therefore, while the creature has glowing eyes, they are not replacements for wheel hubs.",

      "question": "Are there antennae-like structures extending from the top of the creature, featuring electric blue accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two long, thin rods extending upward from the head of the creature. These rods are mounted on mechanical bases and have visible electric blue arcs of energy emanating from their tips, resembling lightning or plasma. Their placement and shape strongly resemble antennae, and the blue electrical effects give them a futuristic or steampunk aesthetic. The combination of mechanical construction and glowing blue elements confirms their role as stylized antennae with electric accents. This matches the description in the question.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature feature steampunk-style elements such as gears, rivets, or brass-colored metalwork, giving it a mechanical guardian appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B exhibits numerous characteristics typical of steampunk design. It includes brass-colored metal fittings, rivets along the edges of the armored plates, exposed piping, and mechanical components like gears and valves. The overall aesthetic combines industrial machinery with ornate detailing, common in steampunk art. The use of aged metal textures, copper-toned fasteners, and complex mechanical systems contributes to a sense of a mechanical guardian or automaton. These visual elements align well with the steampunk genre, reinforcing the impression of a fantastical, retro-futuristic machine.",

      "question": "Are the original tire tread patterns still visible and used as part of the creature’s armored exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the tire tread patterns are clearly visible on the surface of the creature’s body. The segmented back of the creature is constructed from what appears to be repurposed tire material, with the distinctive blocky, aggressive tread pattern forming the outer layer of the armor. This design choice uses the original texture of the tires to create a durable, rugged exterior that mimics natural armor. The treads are not hidden or altered but are integrated directly into the design, serving both functional and aesthetic purposes. Therefore, the original tread patterns are preserved and utilized in the creature’s construction.",

      "question": "Does the creature have a posture or design indicating it is capable of movement, such as being balanced on wheels or having rolling components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B is supported by four large tires, each mounted on a suspension system. The wheels are positioned beneath the body, allowing for ground contact and suggesting mobility. The design includes axles, shocks, and jointed connections that imply dynamic motion. Additionally, the creature is depicted in a stance that suggests balance and readiness to roll forward. The presence of multiple wheels and mechanical articulation supports the conclusion that it is built for movement. Even though it is stationary in the image, its structure indicates it is designed to roll or traverse terrain.",
