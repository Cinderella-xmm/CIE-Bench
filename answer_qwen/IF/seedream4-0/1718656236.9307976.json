      "question": "Does the headpiece feature vibrant feathers and gold accents characteristic of Incan royal headdresses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The headpiece in Image B is adorned with a striking array of colorful feathers in hues of red, orange, blue, green, and purple, arranged symmetrically around a central golden structure. This design closely aligns with historical depictions of Incan royal headdresses, particularly those worn by high-ranking nobility or religious figures. The use of vibrant feathers is a hallmark of Andean ceremonial attire, symbolizing status, divine connection, and cultural identity. Additionally, the gold accents—especially the ornate central medallion and flanking golden elements—reflect the Inca’s reverence for gold as a sacred material. These visual cues, combined with anthropological knowledge of Incan regalia, support the conclusion that the headpiece embodies key characteristics of Incan royal adornment.",

      "question": "Are the previously metallic surfaces of the attire replaced with woven textiles displaying intricate geometric patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoulder pieces and upper torso of the attire are clearly made of woven textiles rather than solid metallic surfaces. These textiles feature detailed geometric patterns, including diamond shapes and stepped motifs, which are typical of Andean weaving traditions. The texture appears to be handwoven, with visible threads and a layered composition, contrasting sharply with the smooth, reflective metallic finish seen in Image A. This shift from metal to textile reflects a transformation toward traditional Incan clothing styles, where elaborate textiles were often more prestigious than metalwork. The use of such patterns also aligns with known Incan textile artistry, emphasizing symbolic designs passed down through generations. Therefore, the replacement of metallic surfaces with intricately patterned woven textiles is evident.",

      "question": "Is the necklace composed of multiple layered elements made of gold and turquoise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The necklace in Image B consists of several distinct layers. The topmost layer is a broad band of small, cylindrical gold beads, followed by a row of larger turquoise beads, and another layer of gold beneath. This multi-layered structure is consistent with the opulent jewelry styles associated with Incan royalty, where gold and turquoise were highly valued materials. Turquoise was not native to the Andes but was traded extensively and used symbolically in elite adornments. The combination of these materials in layered form reflects both aesthetic richness and cultural significance. The craftsmanship and arrangement match known examples of Incan regal necklaces, confirming that the piece is indeed composed of multiple layered elements made of gold and turquoise.",

      "question": "Do the overall colors of the attire and accessories include warm, regal tones such as gold, terracotta, ochre, and turquoise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette of the attire and accessories in Image B prominently features warm, rich tones. Gold dominates the headpiece, earrings, and necklace, symbolizing wealth and divinity. Terracotta and ochre hues are present in the woven textiles of the shoulder armor and background fabric, evoking earthy, natural pigments commonly used in Andean cultures. Turquoise is clearly visible in the layered necklace, adding a contrasting yet harmonious element. Together, these colors create a regal and culturally resonant appearance, consistent with Incan artistic preferences for bold, meaningful color combinations. The use of such tones enhances the sense of nobility and spiritual significance, reinforcing the authenticity of the depiction.",

      "question": "Do the attire and accessories incorporate symbolic Incan design elements such as geometric motifs, stepped patterns, or animal symbols?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The attire in Image B displays numerous symbolic Incan design elements. The woven textiles on the shoulders feature geometric motifs, including stepped patterns and angular shapes, which are characteristic of Incan textile art and architecture. These patterns often represented cosmological concepts, such as mountains, the sun, or celestial bodies. While no explicit animal symbols (like condors or felines) are immediately visible in the image, the stepped and symmetrical designs are deeply rooted in Incan symbolism. The gold elements also contain stylized forms that may represent deities or mythological beings. Overall, the integration of geometric and stepped patterns strongly suggests the presence of symbolic Incan design principles, even if animal motifs are not overtly depicted.",

      "question": "Has the facial expression and features of the person remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the facial features—including the shape of the eyes, nose, lips, and eyebrows—as well as the facial expression, appear nearly identical. Both images depict the same individual with a neutral, direct gaze and a composed demeanor. The lighting and angle are consistent, suggesting the same model and pose. While the attire and accessories have been significantly altered, the face remains unmodified. This indicates that the editing process focused on changing the costume and cultural representation while preserving the original facial identity. Therefore, based on visual consistency and absence of any changes to facial structure or expression, it can be concluded that the facial features and expression have remained unchanged.",
