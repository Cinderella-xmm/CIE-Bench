      "question": "Is the pottery setup enclosed within a transparent glass cloche?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire miniature scene is visibly covered by a dome-shaped, transparent structure that resembles a glass cloche. This cloche is mounted on a wooden base and encloses the pottery setup, including the table, tools, and fairy figures. The transparency allows full visibility of the contents while protecting them, which is consistent with the purpose of a glass cloche in display dioramas. Based on visual cues such as reflections, curvature, and clarity, this structure is clearly made of glass or a similar transparent material. Therefore, the pottery setup is indeed enclosed within a transparent glass cloche.",

      "question": "Do the clay pieces display a vibrant patina with visible coloration (e.g., green, blue, or copper tones) rather than plain gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clay pieces—such as the vases and the lumps of clay—are not uniformly gray. Instead, they exhibit a colorful, iridescent finish with hues of blue, green, and purple, resembling a patina effect often seen in aged metal or glazed ceramics. This vibrant coloration contrasts sharply with the plain gray appearance of the same objects in Image A. The presence of these vivid colors suggests intentional artistic treatment to mimic aged or glazed pottery, enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the miniature scene. Thus, the clay pieces do display vibrant patina-like coloration.",

      "question": "Are there miniature fairy figures visible, actively kneading clay, and located among pottery tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains two small figurines with wings and floral crowns, positioned at the pottery table. These figures are depicted in dynamic poses, with their hands shaping clay on pottery wheels, indicating active engagement in the process of kneading or molding clay. They are surrounded by pottery tools such as wooden paddles and sculpting instruments, reinforcing the context of a pottery workshop. Their design, including delicate wings and ethereal attire, identifies them as fairies. Therefore, the presence of miniature fairy figures actively involved in pottery work is confirmed.",

      "question": "Are there patches of green moss and small flowers growing along the edges of the wooden table and surrounding areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the structure is adorned with lush green moss and small flowering plants, including white daisies and pink blossoms, arranged around the perimeter of the wooden platform. These natural elements extend from the edge of the base upward, partially framing the table and adding a whimsical, garden-like atmosphere. The moss appears realistic and textured, suggesting it was carefully placed to enhance the fairy-tale theme. In contrast, Image A lacks any vegetation or floral elements. Thus, the presence of moss and flowers is a notable addition in Image B.",

      "question": "Is there a wooden plaque with engraved text or artisan details positioned at the base of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the front of the wooden base in Image B, there is a rectangular wooden plaque affixed with small metal screws. The plaque contains engraved text, though the exact wording is partially obscured. However, the presence of stylized lettering and the formal placement suggest it includes information about the artwork, such as the artist's name or title. This detail is absent in Image A, where no plaque or inscription is visible. The inclusion of such a plaque is typical for collectible or artisanal dioramas, serving both decorative and informational purposes. Therefore, the plaque is present in Image B.",
