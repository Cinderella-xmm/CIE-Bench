      "question": "Are the teddy bears rendered as mosaic figurines made of small colorful tiles mimicking fur texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bears are composed of numerous small, square-shaped tiles arranged in a mosaic pattern. These tiles vary in color and shade, creating a textured appearance that mimics the look of fur through color gradients and tile placement. The overall structure and surface detail suggest an intentional artistic representation using mosaic techniques rather than soft fabric or yarn. This is consistent with mosaic art, where individual tiles are used to form larger images or objects with defined textures. The visual cues—such as the geometric shapes, sharp edges between tiles, and reflective surfaces—support the conclusion that these are mosaic figurines designed to resemble the original knitted bears.",

      "question": "Have the knitted sweaters been replaced with intricate tile patterns in yellow and turquoise hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bodies of the teddy bears are covered in tile patterns that match the yellow and turquoise colors seen in the original image (Image A). However, instead of being soft knitted fabric, these areas are now constructed from small, precisely arranged tiles forming a mosaic effect. The yellow bear has a predominantly yellow-tiled torso with brown accents on the limbs, while the turquoise bear features a similar design but with turquoise tiles. The tile arrangement follows the contours of the bears' bodies, maintaining the sweater-like shape but replacing the texture of knitting with a rigid, segmented mosaic pattern. This transformation aligns with the shift from textile to ceramic or glass mosaic art.",

      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, snout) recreated using subtly shaded tiles to provide detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the facial features of the bears—including the eyes, nose, mouth, and snout—are formed using tiles of varying shades. For instance, the eyes are dark-colored tiles, the nose is a reddish-brown tile, and the snout area uses lighter beige or white tiles to create contrast. The mouth is represented by a thin line of darker tiles, suggesting a stitched or drawn expression. These details are achieved through careful selection and placement of tiles with subtle shading differences, which allows for depth and definition despite the mosaic medium. This technique is common in mosaic art to simulate natural features and expressions.",

      "question": "Do the bows appear in glossy, smooth tiles that contrast with the mosaic texture of the rest of the bears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bows on both bears in Image B have a noticeably different surface quality compared to the surrounding mosaic tiles. They exhibit a high-gloss finish, reflecting light more uniformly and appearing smoother than the matte, fragmented texture of the mosaic body. This suggests that the bows are either made from polished tiles or a different material altogether, such as glazed ceramic or acrylic, designed to mimic the sheen of satin ribbons. This visual contrast enhances the decorative appeal of the bows and distinguishes them from the rest of the mosaic structure, aligning with artistic choices to highlight certain elements.",

      "question": "Are the mosaic bears positioned on a minimalistic white pedestal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two mosaic bears are placed on a clean, white, cube-shaped platform. This pedestal has sharp edges and a uniform surface, typical of minimalist design. It contrasts sharply with the textured mosaic bears and the plain background, drawing attention to the figurines as the focal point. The simplicity of the pedestal—lacking ornamentation or color—supports the interpretation of it being a minimalistic display stand, commonly used in art exhibitions to elevate and showcase sculptures or decorative pieces without distraction.",
