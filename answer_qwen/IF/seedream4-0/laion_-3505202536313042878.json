      "question": "Is the couple depicted in a semi-cartoon style with simplified features and outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the couple is rendered in a stylized, non-photorealistic manner. Their facial features are simplified—such as large eyes, minimal shading, and smooth contours—and their bodies are drawn with clean, bold outlines typical of cartoon or graphic illustration styles. The proportions are exaggerated slightly for expressive effect, such as the man’s broad smile and the woman’s prominent hairline. These characteristics align with semi-cartoon or caricature art styles, which use simplified forms to convey likeness without photographic detail. This contrasts with realistic depictions where fine details like skin texture, nuanced lighting, and natural proportions dominate.",

      "question": "Are the man's tuxedo and the woman’s fur jacket visibly exaggerated in size or shape compared to their original appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's tuxedo and the woman’s fur jacket appear proportionally consistent with standard formal wear, though they are stylized. The tuxedo has a classic silhouette with a defined lapel and waistline, and the fur jacket maintains its general shape and volume, albeit simplified. However, there is no significant exaggeration in size or form—such as overly wide shoulders or elongated sleeves—that would suggest distortion. Comparing this to Image A (the original photo), both garments retain their original structural proportions in the cartoon version, even if rendered more simply. The artistic style emphasizes clarity and elegance rather than caricatured proportions.",

      "question": "Is the background composed of simplified linear representations of the FIA Prize Giving 2013 emblem rather than the original photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a blue backdrop with repeating patterns that resemble the FIA Prize Giving 2013 logo. However, these logos are not detailed reproductions but instead consist of abstracted, linear elements—such as radiating lines and simplified text—indicative of a minimalist or illustrative design approach. Unlike the original photograph in Image A, which displays clear, high-resolution branding with full logos and sponsor names, Image B uses symbolic line drawings to represent the same content. This simplification is consistent with graphic illustrations that prioritize visual harmony over photorealism. Thus, the background is indeed a simplified, linear interpretation.",

      "question": "Does the image feature a gold-colored, ribbon-like decorative border framing the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a white, perforated border resembling a postage stamp, with two golden ribbons curving along the left and right edges. These ribbons have a flowing, spiral design and are clearly intended as decorative elements. They frame the central image of the couple and add a celebratory aesthetic. This is a deliberate stylistic choice to enhance the visual appeal, mimicking the look of a commemorative stamp. The presence of such ribbons is unmistakable and matches the description of a gold-colored, ribbon-like border.",

      "question": "Is the stamp presented on a blue envelope that has a subtle embossed pattern of the FIA Prize Giving 2013 logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B shows a blue surface behind the stamp-like frame, which resembles an envelope due to its folded corners and texture. Upon close inspection, there is a faint, circular embossed pattern visible on the left side of the envelope, matching the FIA logo seen in the original event branding. This embossing is subtle, consistent with how official seals or logos might be printed on ceremonial envelopes. While not immediately obvious, the presence of this pattern supports the idea that the envelope is designed to reflect the event's identity. Given the context and visual cues, it is reasonable to conclude that the envelope features a subtle embossed FIA logo.",
