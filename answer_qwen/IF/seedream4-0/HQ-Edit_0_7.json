      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues clearly show a rounded, transparent structure enclosing the parrot and surrounding elements. The dome is made of clear glass or acrylic, allowing full visibility of the interior while maintaining a sealed environment. The base supports this dome with a wooden platform, confirming it is a terrarium-style display. This type of enclosure is commonly used in dioramas to protect and showcase miniature scenes. The presence of reflections on the surface and the way light interacts with the edges further confirms the material is transparent glass. Based on these observations, the entire scene is indeed enclosed.",

      "question": "Is the parrot depicted in a chibi style with a large head and simplified body proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parrot in Image B has exaggerated features typical of chibi art style: an oversized round head relative to its body, large expressive eyes, a small beak, and a simplified, cartoonish body shape. The proportions are not anatomically accurate but stylized for cuteness and appeal. This contrasts with realistic depictions seen in nature or traditional wildlife art. Chibi style is common in anime and collectible figurines, often used to create endearing characters. The overall design aligns perfectly with this aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are the leaves surrounding the parrot significantly larger than normal scale and vibrant in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaves in Image B are highly stylized and appear disproportionately large compared to the parrot, especially when considering natural scale. In reality, tropical leaves vary in size, but none would typically dominate a scene so dramatically unless scaled up for artistic effect. The colors are also vivid—deep greens with highlights of yellow and red—suggesting enhanced vibrancy beyond natural pigmentation. This exaggeration is common in fantasy or decorative dioramas to emphasize visual impact. Therefore, both the size and color intensity exceed natural norms.",

      "question": "Are there small, shiny, crystal-like beads visible on the surface of the leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, numerous small, spherical, reflective objects are scattered across the surfaces of the leaves and moss. These resemble water droplets or decorative crystal beads, exhibiting high gloss and refractive qualities. They catch light and reflect surroundings, suggesting they are intentionally placed for aesthetic enhancement. While real dewdrops can look similar, their uniformity and density suggest artificial placement, likely as part of the diorama's design to simulate freshness or sparkle. Thus, these are best described as crystal-like beads.",

      "question": "Is there a tiny human figure on a different branch, holding a sketchbook or drawing tool and facing the parrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small figurine resembling a person wearing a hat and backpack is positioned on a separate branch near the base of the scene. The figure is seated and appears to be holding a flat object that looks like a sketchbook, with one hand possibly holding a pencil or pen. Its posture suggests it is observing or drawing the parrot. This detail adds narrative depth to the diorama, implying a theme of exploration or artistry. The scale of the figure is consistent with other miniature elements, reinforcing its role as a decorative component.",

      "question": "Does the base of the glass dome feature a wooden texture with carved or etched tribal patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the glass dome in Image B is circular and made of wood, showing a distinct grain pattern typical of natural timber. Along the outer edge, there are intricate geometric designs etched into the wood, including triangles, zigzags, and angular motifs that resemble tribal or indigenous art styles. These patterns are symmetrical and carefully crafted, suggesting intentional decoration. Such designs are often used in cultural or thematic displays to evoke a sense of place or heritage, particularly in jungle or rainforest-themed items. The combination of texture and carving confirms this description.",

      "question": "Does the diorama include visual elements such as dense foliage, mist, or warm ambient lighting that suggest a rainforest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features lush green foliage surrounding the central parrot, with broad leaves and moss-covered branches, all characteristic of a tropical rainforest. However, there is no visible mist or fog present in the scene. The lighting appears bright and even, with soft shadows, indicating daylight rather than the dappled or hazy light often associated with misty rainforests. While the dense vegetation contributes to the rainforest ambiance, the absence of mist and the lack of warm ambient glow (such as golden hour lighting) mean that only some elements align with a true rainforest atmosphere. The overall impression is more curated and stylized than naturalistic.",
