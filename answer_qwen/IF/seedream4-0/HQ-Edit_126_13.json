      "question": "Is there a diagram composed of annotated lines and minimalist icons surrounding the tea set, illustrating the four steps of \"The Journey of Tea\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a circular diagram is clearly visible around the tea set. It consists of curved lines connecting minimalist icons and text annotations that describe stages in a tea ritual. The labels include phrases like 'Tea leaves harvested,' 'Boiling for water poured,' 'Sipping for mindfulness,' and 'Blossoms symbolize tranquility.' These elements are arranged in a flowing, clockwise sequence around the central tea setup. Based on visual analysis, this structure aligns with the description of a diagram illustrating a journey or process—specifically, 'The Journey of Tea.' The presence of both textual annotations and symbolic icons confirms the existence of such a diagram.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there four distinct minimalist icons visible in the image, each corresponding to one of the following: tea leaves harvested, boiling water poured, sipping for mindfulness, and blossoms symbolizing tranquility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, four distinct minimalist icons can be identified along the circular diagram. First, near the label 'Tea leaves harvested,' there is a small green leaf icon. Second, adjacent to 'Boiling for water poured,' there is a stylized depiction of steam rising from a kettle. Third, next to 'Sipping for mindfulness,' there is an icon of a meditating figure, symbolizing mindful consumption. Fourth, near 'Blossoms symbolize tranquility,' a floral motif resembling cherry blossoms is present. Each icon is simple, consistent in style, and directly associated with its respective label. This confirms that all four intended icons are present and correctly matched to their descriptions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the labels or captions accompanying the diagram written in a handwritten calligraphy style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in the diagram of Image B is rendered in a fluid, cursive script that mimics handwriting. The letters have varying stroke thicknesses and irregular spacing, characteristic of calligraphic writing rather than standard print or sans-serif fonts. Additionally, the overall aesthetic of the text complements the tranquil, artistic theme of the scene, reinforcing the impression of handcrafted calligraphy. While not strictly traditional East Asian calligraphy, it stylistically resembles a modern handwritten script used for artistic effect. Therefore, the labels can reasonably be described as being in a handwritten calligraphy style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are soft pastel green hues present in the diagram elements (e.g., lines, icons, or text) to complement the overall color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The diagram elements in Image B—including the circular line, the icons, and the text—are consistently colored in a soft, muted green tone. This hue is light and subtle, fitting the definition of a pastel green. It harmonizes well with the warm beige and brown tones of the tea set and mats, enhancing the serene and natural ambiance of the scene. The use of this color choice supports a cohesive visual theme, suggesting tranquility and connection to nature. Thus, the presence of soft pastel green hues is evident and intentional.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all original objects—the teapot, cup, chopsticks, vase with cherry blossoms, and patterned mats—present and unchanged in their positions and appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A (the original), the core objects remain present: a black teapot, a dark tea cup, wooden chopsticks, a vase with cherry blossoms, and patterned mats under the tea set. However, upon closer inspection, the teapot now rests on a bamboo mat instead of the previously solid wooden tray seen in Image A. This change alters the appearance and context of the teapot’s placement. Additionally, the lighting and shadows appear slightly adjusted due to the added diagram's overlay. While most objects are preserved, the substitution of the tray with a bamboo mat constitutes a meaningful change in appearance. Therefore, not all objects are unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the added diagram avoid overlapping or obscuring any of the original table elements and instead flow naturally around them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The diagram in Image B is designed to wrap around the central tea set without covering key objects. The lines and text arc gracefully above and around the teapot, cup, chopsticks, and vase, maintaining clear visibility of each item. The icons and labels are placed at strategic points where they do not intersect with the physical objects on the table. For example, the text 'Tea leaves harvested' appears in the upper left, away from the teapot, while 'Sipping for mindfulness' is positioned near the bottom edge, avoiding the chopsticks. The layout respects spatial boundaries and enhances the composition without obstruction. This indicates that the diagram flows naturally around the elements.",
