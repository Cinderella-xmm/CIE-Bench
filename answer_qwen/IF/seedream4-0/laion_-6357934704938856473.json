      "question": "Does the robot exhibit a brushed metal and matte finish across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the robot's surface shows a combination of textures. The primary body panels have a smooth, slightly reflective metallic sheen consistent with a brushed metal finish, particularly noticeable on the armor plating and weapon surfaces. Additionally, certain areas like joints and inner components appear to have a non-reflective, matte texture, which is common in mechanical designs to reduce glare and enhance realism. This dual-texture approach is typical in high-detail mecha models to simulate different materials (e.g., polished alloy vs. composite armor). Therefore, based on visual cues such as light reflection patterns and surface consistency, it can be concluded that the robot exhibits both brushed metal and matte finishes.",

      "question": "Is the robot displayed inside a hexagonal box labeled \"MECHA VANGUARD\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is positioned within a structured display base. Observing the base, it has a geometric, hexagonal shape with clean edges and angular design elements typical of premium collectible packaging. The front face of the base clearly displays the text 'MECHA VANGUARD' in bold capital letters, confirming the label. This presentation style is characteristic of limited-edition or collector-grade models, where branding and display aesthetics are emphasized. Thus, the visual evidence supports the presence of a hexagonal box with the specified label.",

      "question": "Are multiple weapons visible, indicating they are replaceable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is equipped with a rifle held in its right hand and a large sword-like weapon in its left. Additionally, there is a second rifle placed on the display base near the robot’s feet. The presence of an extra weapon suggests modularity and interchangeability, which is a common feature in mecha designs for versatility in combat scenarios. Furthermore, the way the weapons are stored—separately from the robot but within the same display case—implies they are detachable and potentially swappable. This aligns with real-world model kit conventions where accessories are designed to be interchangeable. Hence, the visual evidence indicates multiple weapons are present and likely replaceable.",

      "question": "Are there visible detailed engravings on the robot's armor plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A close inspection of the robot in Image B reveals fine lines, panel lines, and subtle markings on various armor sections, such as the chest, shoulders, and legs. These include linear grooves, rivet-like details, and inscriptions (e.g., on the wing-like structure behind the robot), which suggest technical labeling or serial numbers. Such engravings are typical in advanced mecha designs to convey mechanical authenticity and manufacturing detail. They serve both aesthetic and functional purposes, simulating wear, structural reinforcement, or identification tags. Therefore, based on the clarity and precision of these features, detailed engravings are indeed visible.",

      "question": "Are visible joint articulations present at key limb connections (e.g., shoulders, elbows, hips)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the robot’s limbs in Image B, distinct mechanical joints are apparent at the shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees. These joints feature segmented armor pieces, pivot points, and cylindrical connectors that mimic ball-and-socket or hinge mechanisms. For instance, the shoulder area shows layered plates with circular indentations, indicative of rotational movement. Similarly, the elbow and hip regions display articulated segments that allow for range of motion. These design elements are consistent with transformable or poseable mecha models, where joint articulation is essential for dynamic posing. The visual cues strongly support the presence of functional joint articulations.",

      "question": "Is there a dramatic splash screen behind the robot depicting a futuristic cityscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a large curved screen displaying a dynamic scene. This screen features a massive splash of water or energy emanating from the center, creating a dramatic effect. Behind this splash, a futuristic cityscape is visible, complete with towering skyscrapers, glowing structures, and illuminated pathways. The composition suggests a high-energy environment, possibly symbolizing a battle or launch scenario. The use of a curved screen to project this imagery enhances the immersive quality of the display. Therefore, the visual elements confirm the presence of a dramatic splash screen with a futuristic cityscape.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cityscape in the background of Image B includes several high-tech elements. Neon lights are evident on the buildings, emitting blue, purple, and red glows, which are characteristic of cyberpunk or futuristic urban environments. There are also sleek, airborne vehicles visible in the sky, resembling drones or personal transport units, further emphasizing advanced technology. Additionally, some structures display digital interfaces or holographic displays, suggesting integrated smart infrastructure. These elements collectively create a technologically advanced atmosphere typical of sci-fi settings. Thus, the background incorporates multiple high-tech features.",
