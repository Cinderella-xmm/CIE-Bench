      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the image is vertically aligned, we examine the orientation of the main elements within the frame. The glass cube housing the LEGO-style figure is positioned centrally and appears to be upright, with its edges parallel to the vertical and horizontal axes of the image. The base is flat and level, and the lighting and shadows are consistent with a stable, upright setup. There is no visible tilt or rotation of the scene that would suggest misalignment. Additionally, the background gradient transitions smoothly from dark gray at the top to light beige at the bottom, which further supports a vertical alignment as the gradient follows a natural top-to-bottom progression. Based on these visual cues and common photographic standards for display items, the image is properly aligned.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central figure in Image B is clearly constructed using LEGO-like components, including a head with printed facial features, articulated limbs, and a torso with button details mimicking a shirt. The proportions, blocky design, and modular construction are characteristic of LEGO minifigures. The figure is seated at a desk with a laptop, replicating the pose and attire of the person in Image A (a woman in a blue shirt working on a laptop). This transformation into a stylized, toy-like representation confirms that the subject has been reimagined in the classic LEGO minifigure format. While the original subject in Image A is a real person, Image B presents a creative reinterpretation using LEGO aesthetics.",

      "question": "Is there a small LEGO-style cat in a light blue color palette next to the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, to the left of the LEGO minifigure, there is a small feline figure constructed from LEGO bricks. It has a distinct cat shape with pointed ears, a curved tail, and simple facial features typical of LEGO animal designs. The color of the cat is consistently light blue, matching the shade of the minifigure’s shirt and the overall color theme of the scene. This light blue color palette aligns with the name 'Cerulean Cat' displayed on the nameplate, reinforcing the intentional design choice. The presence of this cat, both in form and color, confirms the answer.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire LEGO diorama is enclosed within a clear, cubic structure made of transparent material, consistent with glass or high-quality acrylic. The cube has sharp edges and reflective surfaces, allowing full visibility of the interior while protecting the contents. Light reflects off the edges, indicating transparency and structural integrity. The cube sits atop a black base, and the interior is fully visible, confirming that the scene is indeed encased in a transparent glass cube. This type of display case is commonly used for collectible models to preserve and showcase them.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base supporting the glass cube is rectangular and uniformly black. Its surface lacks shine, indicating a matte finish rather than a glossy one. On the front face of the base, there is a metallic plaque with silver-colored text and fasteners, which serve as decorative silver detailing. These elements—matte black surface and silver accents—are consistent with premium display stands often used for collectibles. The contrast between the dark base and the silver hardware enhances the aesthetic appeal and matches the description provided.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the front of the black base, there is a metallic plaque with raised lettering. The text 'Cerulean Cat' is clearly visible and written in a formal, elegant serif font, which is often used in commemorative or collectible displays. Below the main title, smaller text is present, though less legible, likely providing additional information. The style and placement of the nameplate suggest it is intentionally designed to resemble an official label or title card. The use of a serif font adds sophistication, aligning with the curated presentation of the model.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background behind the glass cube shows a smooth gradient effect. At the top, the color is a deep dark gray, which gradually lightens as it moves downward, transitioning into a soft light beige near the bottom of the frame. This gradient is uniform and free of abrupt changes, suggesting a professional studio lighting setup designed to highlight the object without distraction. The seamless nature of the transition enhances the focus on the central display, creating depth and visual harmony. Such gradients are commonly used in product photography to provide a clean, modern backdrop.",
