      "question": "Is the rose bush rendered as a mosaic mural composed of distinct tile-like segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rose bush appears to be transformed into a mosaic-style artwork. The petals and leaves are segmented into small, irregular pieces with visible outlines that resemble individual tiles. These segments are arranged in a way that mimics the natural form of the roses but with a clear artistic interpretation using mosaic techniques. The edges between segments are defined by dark lines, consistent with grout or borders in mosaics. This visual treatment suggests that the entire plant is not a photograph but a stylized representation, likely digitally altered to emulate a mosaic mural. This conclusion is supported by the fact that each petal and leaf is broken into smaller units, which is characteristic of mosaic art.",

      "question": "Are all flowers outlined with bold, distinct borders resembling ceramic tile edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, each flower is clearly delineated by sharp, dark lines that separate the individual segments of the petals and surrounding areas. These lines are consistent in thickness and style across all flowers, mimicking the appearance of grout lines between ceramic tiles. The borders are not subtle but rather prominent, emphasizing the mosaic nature of the image. This stylistic choice enhances the perception of the flowers as constructed from discrete tile pieces, reinforcing the idea of a mosaic mural. The uniformity and clarity of these outlines across all floral elements confirm that they are intentionally designed to resemble tile edges.",

      "question": "Are the petals and leaves depicted in shades of pearl (soft white/off-white) and jade (greenish tones), replacing their original colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petals of the roses are rendered in soft, off-white and creamy hues with subtle pinkish highlights, which aligns with the description of 'pearl' tones. These colors are consistent with the aesthetic of polished stone or ceramic materials used in mosaics. The leaves are depicted in various shades of green, ranging from light to darker green, which can be interpreted as 'jade' tones—commonly associated with smooth, semi-precious stones. These color choices differ significantly from the natural greens and whites seen in typical rose bushes, indicating a deliberate shift toward a more artistic, material-based palette. The use of these specific tones supports the mosaic interpretation and replaces the original natural colors with a stylized, gem-like appearance.",

      "question": "Has the red brick building been abstracted using terracotta tile shades (warm earthy tones) instead of realistic red bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background building in Image B no longer displays realistic red bricks. Instead, it is composed of a grid of square and rectangular tiles in varying warm earthy tones such as orange, rust, and terracotta. These tiles are arranged in a pattern that mimics the structure of the original building but with an artistic abstraction. The texture and color scheme suggest a mosaic rendering, where the original architectural material (brick) has been replaced with a stylized tile pattern. This transformation aligns with the overall mosaic theme of the image, where both the flora and architecture are reimagined using tile-like elements. Thus, the building has indeed been abstracted into a terracotta tile composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are architectural features of the building (such as arches or window frames) incorporated into the mosaic pattern as stylized elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural details of the building—specifically the arched window and its surrounding frame—are still discernible, but they have been integrated into the mosaic design. The arch and window frame are outlined with darker tiles and follow the same segmented, tile-based style as the rest of the image. The curves of the arch are formed by curved tile shapes, maintaining the structural integrity of the original feature while adapting it to the mosaic medium. Additionally, the window's decorative tracery is simplified but preserved in the tile pattern, indicating that key architectural elements have been stylized and incorporated into the overall mosaic composition. This demonstrates that the design does not ignore architectural features but rather transforms them into part of the mosaic artwork.",
