      "question": "Does the kimono feature stylized, bold outlines and vibrant, flat or gradient colors characteristic of anime illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono displays distinct visual traits typical of anime or manga-style illustrations. The patterns on the kimono are outlined with sharp, clean lines that define each floral element clearly, which is a hallmark of anime art. Additionally, the colors used—such as the bright reds, pinks, and whites—are vivid and appear in flat or smoothly gradient forms rather than having naturalistic shading or texture. This contrasts with realistic depictions where fabric would show subtle variations in tone due to light and shadow. The overall rendering lacks depth through traditional lighting effects and instead emphasizes clarity and color contrast, aligning with common anime aesthetics.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms visibly enlarged beyond natural proportions and rendered in bright, unnatural colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cherry blossoms in Image B are indeed larger than what would be expected in real life, especially when compared to the scale of the person’s head and face. Their size appears exaggerated for artistic effect. Furthermore, the colors of the blossoms—especially the vivid pinks, yellows, and reds—are more saturated and uniform than natural cherry blossoms, which typically have softer, more muted hues. This use of heightened color intensity and oversized elements is consistent with stylized illustration techniques often seen in anime or graphic art, where realism is sacrificed for visual impact.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossom branches depicted with sharp, high-contrast ink-like lines, lacking soft gradients or natural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branches in Image B are drawn with strong, black outlines that resemble ink strokes commonly found in comic or anime art. These lines are crisp and lack the subtle gradations or organic roughness seen in natural twigs. There is no visible texture such as bark detail or variation in thickness, and the edges are uniformly defined. This stylistic choice removes naturalism and enhances the illustrative quality, making the branches look like they were drawn with a pen or digital brush rather than photographed. Such rendering is typical in cartoonish or anime-inspired artwork.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there strong, visually striking color contrasts throughout the image, especially between the kimono, flowers, and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a high degree of color contrast. The red and white of the kimono stand out sharply against the pale blue sky in the background. Similarly, the pink and yellow flowers pop against both the dark hair and the lighter backdrop. The mask itself has a dark, metallic appearance that contrasts strongly with the skin tone and surrounding colors. These deliberate choices create a dynamic and eye-catching composition, emphasizing visual hierarchy and aesthetic appeal—a common technique in anime and illustrated media to draw attention to key elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the person’s face, mask, hairstyle, and general pose preserved in the same position and orientation as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A (the original), the subject's facial features, including the placement of the mask, the shape of the eyes, lips, and nose, remain consistent in terms of positioning and orientation. The hairstyle, with its elaborate updo and long braid, is also preserved in structure and placement. The overall pose—facing forward with a neutral expression and symmetrical framing—is identical. While the style has changed from photorealistic to illustrative, the spatial arrangement of all major components has not been altered. This indicates that the edit focused on artistic transformation rather than repositioning or restructuring the figure.",
