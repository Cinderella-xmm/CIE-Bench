    "Question": "Q1: Are the athlete's muscles visibly exaggerated in a comic-book style, with enhanced definition and volume?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the athlete's musculature is rendered with highly defined contours, sharp edges, and pronounced volume, particularly noticeable in the arms, shoulders, and abdominal region. This stylization goes beyond realistic human anatomy and aligns with the exaggerated proportions commonly seen in comic-book art, where muscles are often amplified for dramatic effect. The use of strong black outlines and shading further emphasizes this cartoonish, hyper-realistic aesthetic typical of illustrated action characters. Compared to real-life athletes, the muscle definition here is not anatomically accurate but artistically intensified, consistent with comic-book conventions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the boxing gloves predominantly fiery red with visible gold accents such as trim or highlights?",
    "explanation": "The boxing gloves in Image B are indeed a vibrant, fiery red, which stands out against the background. Upon closer inspection, especially on the wrist strap area of the right glove, there is a distinct golden band or accent that adds a metallic highlight. This gold trim enhances the visual impact and contributes to a more dynamic, stylized appearance. Such detailing is common in comic-style illustrations to emphasize power or energy, reinforcing the idea of 'fiery' intensity. The combination of red and gold creates a striking contrast that draws attention to the gloves.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the background composed of dynamic, vibrant strobe lights creating an electrifying effect with bright flashes and contrast?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B features a high-energy scene with multiple bright light sources—white and blue spotlights, along with red beams and electric-like streaks. These elements simulate strobe lighting effects, common in arenas or performance settings to create excitement. Additionally, there are visual cues like lightning bolts and flame motifs that amplify the sense of motion and intensity. The overall composition uses strong contrasts between dark areas and bright flashes, contributing to a vivid, electrifying atmosphere. This is characteristic of comic-book art styles that exaggerate lighting for dramatic effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a blank rectangular panel positioned on the side of the image, intended for a motivational quote?",
    "explanation": "On the left side of Image B, there is a white rectangular panel with no text inside it, bordered by a thin frame. It is positioned adjacent to a colorful poster with bold text. Given its clean, empty design and placement within what appears to be a promotional or artistic layout, this panel is clearly intended as a space for customization—likely for a motivational quote or message. Such design choices are common in gym decor or inspirational artwork, where users can add personal or team slogans. The surrounding context supports this interpretation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the image presented as three distinct but unified prints arranged side by side, suitable for display as gym wall art?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not appear to be composed of three separate prints. Instead, it is a single, cohesive illustration with a continuous scene. While there are visual elements like posters on the wall and a framed panel, these are part of the internal composition of the image rather than external physical prints. There is no indication of seams, borders, or separations that would suggest multiple panels. Therefore, despite its potential use as wall art, the image itself is not structured as three distinct prints arranged together.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q6: Does the image include bold, large-scale typography that contributes to the energetic and sporty aesthetic?",
    "explanation": "Yes, the image includes bold, large-scale typography on the yellow and blue poster to the left, which reads 'MINCIE SPORT SOORT ENERGY'. The text is styled in a dynamic, angular font with high contrast and color blocking, typical of energetic branding in sports or fitness contexts. This typeface choice enhances the overall vibrancy and conveys movement and power, aligning with the sporty and motivational theme of the artwork. The presence of such prominent lettering reinforces the energetic tone of the piece.",
    "answer": "Yes"
