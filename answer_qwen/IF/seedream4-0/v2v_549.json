      "question": "Is the Funko Pop-style box shown in an isometric view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the box is shown in an isometric view, we analyze its perspective. An isometric view presents three-dimensional objects with equal foreshortening along each axis, typically showing the top and two side faces at 30-degree angles, without a vanishing point. In Image B, the box is angled such that the front, top, and one side are visible, and the edges appear parallel rather than converging, which is characteristic of an isometric projection. The consistent scaling and lack of perspective distortion further support this interpretation. This aligns with common product photography techniques used to showcase collectible packaging in a clean, stylized manner.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure of the baseball player hold a bat and wear a helmet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure is clearly depicted standing outside the box. Visual inspection shows that the figure is holding a baseball bat in both hands, positioned as if ready to swing. Additionally, the figure is wearing a dark blue helmet, consistent with typical baseball gear. These elements match the standard design of Funko Pop figures, where characters are stylized but retain key identifying features like equipment and protective gear. Therefore, based on visual cues and world knowledge of Funko Pop designs, the figure does indeed hold a bat and wear a helmet.",

      "question": "Are a ball and glove included as signature elements accompanying the chibi-style figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the contents of the box in Image B, a baseball and a glove are visible inside the packaging, placed near the figure. While the figure outside the box holds a bat, the glove and ball are not attached to it. However, the question asks whether they are 'included as signature elements accompanying' the figure. In the context of collectible figurines, especially Funko Pops, accessories like balls and gloves are often included in the box as part of the set, even if not physically attached to the figure. Since both items are present in the packaging and associated with the figure, they can be considered included signature elements. This aligns with typical Funko Pop product design where thematic accessories enhance the character’s identity.",

      "question": "Is there a realistic depiction of the figure positioned outside of the box with detailed textures and lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure outside the box in Image B is rendered with smooth surfaces, simplified proportions, and exaggerated features—hallmarks of the chibi or Funko Pop style. While the lighting is carefully applied to create shadows and highlights, giving a sense of depth, the textures are stylized rather than photorealistic. For instance, the surface of the helmet and uniform lacks fine detail like fabric weave or material imperfections. The overall rendering prioritizes aesthetic appeal and brand consistency over realism. Thus, while the image uses professional lighting and shading techniques, the figure itself is not a realistic depiction but rather a stylized representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box in Image B prominently displays text on both the front and side panels. On the front, below the window showing the figure, the words 'BASEBALL LEGEND' are clearly printed in bold, uppercase letters. This title is repeated on the side panel as well. Given the context of the product—a collectible figure of a baseball player—the title 'BASEBALL LEGEND' fits thematically and is consistent with branding strategies for sports-themed Funko Pop releases. Therefore, based on direct visual evidence from the packaging, the title is indeed 'BASEBALL LEGEND'.",
