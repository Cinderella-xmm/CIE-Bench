      "question": "Is the typewriter now depicted as part of a notebook cover, with the overall shape resembling a closed book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object is clearly a notebook or journal with a rectangular, closed-book form. The typewriter image is not a physical object but rather an illustration printed on the front cover of this notebook. The edges are rounded and consistent with a bound book, and the perspective shows it lying flat on a surface, reinforcing the impression of a closed book. This contrasts with Image A, where the typewriter is a three-dimensional object placed on a wooden table. Therefore, based on visual cues such as the binding, spine, and overall shape, the typewriter is indeed now part of a notebook cover.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Tales Untold\" visible in a retro-style font across the top half of the notebook cover?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Tales Untold' is prominently displayed in the upper portion of the notebook cover in Image B. The font style is serifed, slightly ornate, and evokes a vintage or classic aesthetic, consistent with retro typography often used for literary or historical themes. It is positioned centrally in the upper half of the cover, above the typewriter illustration. This matches the description of a retro-style font placed in the top half of the cover. In contrast, Image A contains no text at all, so this element is entirely new in Image B.",

      "question": "Are faded ink splatters and parchment-like textures visible on the notebook cover?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cover of the notebook in Image B exhibits a weathered, aged appearance. There are visible brown stains and splotches scattered across the surface, resembling ink splatters or water damage. Additionally, the background texture mimics old parchment paper, with uneven tones, creases, and a slightly rough surface. These details contribute to an antique look, suggesting deliberate design choices to evoke age and history. Such features are absent in Image A, which presents a clean, polished typewriter on a smooth wooden surface without any signs of aging or distress.",

      "question": "Has the wooden table been replaced with a marbled background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the notebook has a white-and-gray veined pattern characteristic of marble. This is distinct from the rich, warm-toned wooden table seen in Image A, which has clear wood grain and a natural finish. The transition from a wooden desk to a marbled surface indicates a change in setting and aesthetic—shifting from a functional workspace to a more refined, decorative presentation. The marbled background enhances the elegant, timeless feel of the notebook, aligning with the nostalgic theme.",

      "question": "Is there a leather-textured spine on the notebook with subtle embossed icons resembling typewriter keys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The left edge of the notebook in Image B shows a dark brown spine with a stitched leather appearance. Along this spine, there are five circular embossed symbols that resemble typewriter keys, including recognizable shapes like 'Q', 'W', 'E', 'R', and 'T'. These icons are stylized but clearly inspired by keyboard layout, reinforcing the typewriter theme. This detail is not present in Image A, where the typewriter stands alone without any binding or spine elements. The inclusion of these embossed icons adds thematic depth and craftsmanship to the notebook's design.",

      "question": "Are the visual details (such as texture, lighting, and iconography) rendered with high fidelity and consistency to evoke a strong sense of nostalgia?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates high visual fidelity in its rendering. The textures—such as the worn parchment cover, the leather spine, the ink stains, and the detailed typewriter illustration—are crisp and realistic. The lighting is soft and even, enhancing the tactile qualities of the materials without harsh shadows. The iconography (typewriter, vintage font, aged paper) consistently supports a nostalgic, literary theme. Together, these elements create a cohesive and immersive aesthetic that strongly evokes the past. In comparison, Image A, while also well-rendered, lacks the layered narrative and thematic depth provided by the notebook format and aging effects in Image B. Thus, Image B’s design successfully uses visual details to build a nostalgic atmosphere.",
