      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the armored figure visibly smaller in scale compared to its original form, consistent with being a miniature sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armored figure is positioned inside a glass dome that is clearly designed as a display case for a small object. The proportions of the figure relative to the surrounding mechanical components—such as the gears and base structure—indicate that it is significantly smaller than life-size. The entire setup resembles a collectible or decorative piece, typical of miniature sculptures displayed under glass domes. Additionally, the intricate details visible on the armor suggest high craftsmanship appropriate for a scaled-down model rather than a full-sized entity. This context, combined with the common use of such enclosures for miniatures, supports the conclusion that the figure is indeed a smaller-scale representation.",

      "question": "Is the armored figure enclosed within a transparent dome featuring metallic structural elements consistent with steampunk design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the armored figure housed within a clear glass dome supported by a brass-colored base. The base includes exposed copper piping, gear mechanisms, and ornate metalwork, all of which are hallmark elements of steampunk aesthetics. The dome itself has a vintage, industrial look, with golden filigree ornaments suspended from chains, reinforcing the steampunk theme. These visual cues—metallic frameworks, brass components, and mechanical motifs—are consistent with the steampunk genre, which blends Victorian-era design with steam-powered technology. Therefore, the enclosure fits the description of a steampunk-inspired display.",

      "question": "Are there visible rotating cogwheels located at the base of the structure beneath the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the base of the glass dome, multiple gear-like structures are visible. These appear to be made of brass or a similar golden-toned metal and are interconnected by pipes, suggesting they are part of a mechanical system. While the image does not show motion, the presence of interlocking cogs and their placement beneath the figure imply they are meant to represent a functional clockwork mechanism. In the context of steampunk design, such components are often depicted as rotating or operational, even if static in still images. Given the detailed rendering and the aesthetic intent, these cogwheels are clearly intended to be perceived as part of a working mechanical assembly.",

      "question": "Are there small mechanical wings attached to the back of the armored figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the armored figure’s back, there are no visible wing-like structures. The shoulder plates are large and spiked, extending outward but not forming any appendages resembling wings. There is no indication of mechanical flaps, articulated joints, or wing-like extensions that would suggest the presence of wings. The design focuses on heavy armor and angular geometry, without any elements that resemble flight apparatus. Thus, based on visual evidence, mechanical wings are absent.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible copper-colored piping details integrated into the surface of the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor itself is primarily composed of silver-gray metallic plating with darkened edges and weathering effects. While there are red-orange accents in certain areas—particularly around the shoulders and chest—these appear to be either paint or glowing elements rather than actual copper piping. The copper-colored elements are concentrated on the base structure and external framework of the display case, not on the armor's surface. No pipework is visibly embedded into the armor’s design. Therefore, despite the steampunk theme, the armor does not feature integrated copper piping.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there multiple spherical brass filigree objects suspended in the air around the figure, mimicking planetary orbits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the glass dome, several spherical objects with intricate brass filigree designs are suspended by thin chains from the top of the dome. These spheres vary in size and are positioned at different heights and angles around the central figure, creating a spatial arrangement that resembles orbiting celestial bodies. Their placement and reflective surfaces enhance the illusion of a miniature solar system. This design choice aligns with artistic representations of cosmic or astronomical themes, particularly within steampunk or gothic fantasy contexts. Hence, the suspended orbs functionally mimic planetary orbits.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the brass filigree orbs arranged in a way that creates a sense of orbiting celestial bodies, contributing to a mystical ambiance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brass filigree orbs are distributed asymmetrically within the dome, with some closer to the figure and others farther out, appearing to follow curved paths around the central axis. This layout evokes the appearance of planets in orbit, especially when viewed from a frontal perspective. The soft lighting reflects off the polished surfaces, enhancing their ethereal glow and reinforcing a sense of movement and mystery. Combined with the mechanical base and the armored figure, this arrangement contributes to a mystical, otherworldly atmosphere typical of fantastical or steampunk art. The intentional spacing and elevation differences further support the interpretation of an orbital system.",
