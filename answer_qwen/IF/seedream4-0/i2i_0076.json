      "question": "Is the word \"warm\" placed at the top left corner in large letters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'warm' is clearly visible in the upper left portion of the image. It is rendered in a large, bold, sans-serif font that stands out against the background wall. Its placement is near the top-left corner, slightly overlapping the edge of the painting and the wall, but still positioned within the top-left quadrant. The size of the text is significantly larger than any other textual elements in the image, making it prominent. Based on visual inspection and common design principles, this placement and sizing align with the description of being 'in large letters' and 'at the top left corner'.",

      "question": "Is the word \"freedom\" placed at the bottom right corner in small letters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'freedom' appears in the lower right section of the image. It is written in lowercase, sans-serif font, and is considerably smaller than the word 'warm'. Its position is close to the bottom-right corner, just above the edge of the rug and near the base of the potted plant. While it is not perfectly centered in the corner, it is clearly located in the bottom-right area. The font size is modest compared to the rest of the image, consistent with the description of 'small letters'. This placement adheres to typical minimalist design practices where secondary text is subtly introduced without dominating the composition.",

      "question": "Are all original elements, such as the sofa, cushions, rug, plant, and wall art, still present without alteration except for additions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements in Image B—the beige sofa, the arrangement of cushions (two light and one darker), the textured rug, the tall potted plant, and the framed mountain landscape artwork—appear visually identical to those typically found in such interior settings. There are no visible distortions, missing parts, or modifications to these objects. The only changes are the addition of two words: 'warm' and 'freedom'. These texts are overlaid on the image and do not alter the physical attributes or positions of the original furniture or decor. Therefore, based on visual analysis and the absence of any evident editing to the core elements, they remain intact and unaltered except for the textual additions.",

      "question": "Does the image convey a \"home living\" feel with warm tones, soft lighting, and cozy arrangement of furniture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a well-composed living room scene with a neutral color palette dominated by beige, cream, and earthy browns. The lighting appears soft and natural, likely from a window on the left, casting gentle shadows and highlighting textures such as the sofa fabric and rug. The furniture arrangement is balanced and inviting, with a central sofa flanked by a plant and framed art above, creating a sense of harmony and comfort. The artwork itself features a sunset over mountains, reinforcing warmth and tranquility. Together, these elements—color scheme, lighting, furniture layout, and decorative choices—strongly evoke a 'home living' atmosphere that feels serene and cozy. This interpretation aligns with common design principles associated with comfortable domestic interiors.",

      "question": "Is the text placement well-balanced so that it complements the rest of the image without disrupting the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B consists of 'warm' in the top-left and 'freedom' in the bottom-right. These placements follow a diagonal balance, which is a common compositional technique in graphic design to create visual interest without clutter. 'Warm' is large and dominant but positioned near the edge, allowing the main subject (the sofa and artwork) to remain the focal point. 'Freedom' is smaller and less intrusive, placed discreetly in the corner, avoiding interference with key visual elements. Neither text overlaps critical details like the sofa or plant in a disruptive way. Their contrast in size and placement creates a subtle narrative arc while maintaining aesthetic harmony. Thus, the text enhances rather than detracts from the overall composition, supporting the image’s mood and theme.",
