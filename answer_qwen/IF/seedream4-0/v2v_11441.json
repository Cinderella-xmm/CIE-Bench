        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground is visibly covered with a layer of white snow, particularly noticeable on the grassy areas and along the edges of the sidewalk. The snow appears to be piled up slightly around the base of the sidewalk, indicating accumulation over time. This is consistent with typical winter scenes where snow blankets the ground. The presence of snow on the pavement and surrounding areas strongly suggests that the ground is indeed covered in snow.",

      "question": "Are there snowflakes falling in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small white shapes resembling snowflakes are scattered across the sky and appear to be drifting downward. These shapes are consistent with the visual representation of falling snowflakes in illustrations. Additionally, the overall atmosphere of the image, including the snowy ground and the characters' winter attire, supports the idea that it is actively snowing. This aligns with common artistic depictions of snowfall, where individual flakes are illustrated to convey ongoing precipitation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the radish character is wearing a pink and beige plaid scarf wrapped around its neck, which is clearly visible. Additionally, it has a knitted hat with a pink and white pattern covering the top of its head, complete with a small pom-pom-like detail. These accessories are typical winter clothing items designed to keep warmth, and their presence indicates that the character is dressed for cold weather. The combination of both scarf and hat confirms that the radish character is fully equipped for winter conditions.",

      "question": "Is the dog wearing a winter jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is wearing a brown puffy jacket with a white fur-lined collar and visible stitching, which resembles a winter coat or jacket. This type of clothing is commonly used to protect animals from cold temperatures during winter. The jacket covers most of the dog's body, leaving only its legs and head exposed, which is characteristic of pet winter wear. The presence of this garment, combined with the snowy environment, strongly suggests that the dog is dressed appropriately for cold weather.",

      "question": "Does the scene overall appear to be a winter landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple visual cues indicate a winter setting: the ground is covered in snow, snowflakes are falling from the sky, and both the radish character and the dog are dressed in winter clothing (scarf, hat, and jacket). These elements collectively create an atmosphere typical of a winter landscape. The muted color palette, soft lighting, and presence of snow further reinforce the seasonal context. Comparing this to a typical summer or spring scene would reveal significant differences—such as green grass, no snow, and lighter clothing—making it clear that this scene depicts winter. Therefore, based on the comprehensive environmental and attire cues, the scene is unmistakably a winter landscape.",
