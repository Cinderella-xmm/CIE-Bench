      "question": "Has the Hagia Sophia been transformed into a creature-like figure with a distinct body, head, or limb-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure that was originally the Hagia Sophia has undergone a dramatic transformation. The central dome now serves as the 'head' of a fantastical creature, with two large, symmetrical wing-like appendages extending from either side. These wings are highly ornate and metallic, glowing with intricate patterns. Below the dome, multiple slender, leg-like structures emerge from the base, supporting the entire form. These features collectively give the appearance of a mythical, biomechanical creature with a clear body, head (the central dome), and limbs (the legs and wings). This transformation is not realistic but rather surreal and artistic, combining architectural elements with biological and mechanical forms. Based on visual cues—such as the symmetry, the presence of limbs, and the organic yet metallic design—it is evident that the building has been reimagined as a creature-like entity.",

      "question": "Do the smaller domes on the sides of the structure appear as large, metallic, wing-like appendages extending outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smaller domes that were originally part of the Hagia Sophia's architectural complex have been replaced or reinterpreted as massive, wing-like structures. These wings are made of reflective, metallic material with glowing golden patterns and circular motifs resembling celestial designs. They extend outward symmetrically from the central dome, mimicking the form of wings. While in Image A these domes are small, rounded, and functional architectural elements, in Image B they have been artistically transformed into prominent, fantastical appendages. This transformation suggests an intentional reimagining of the original structure’s features into symbolic, almost divine wings. Therefore, based on the visual evidence, the smaller domes have indeed been reinterpreted as large, metallic, wing-like extensions.",

      "question": "Have the four minarets been replaced with long, slender, leg-like structures that support the body of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the Hagia Sophia is flanked by four tall, slender minarets, which are traditional Islamic architectural features. In Image B, these minarets are no longer visible. Instead, the structure is supported by multiple long, metallic, leg-like appendages extending downward from the central body. These legs are sleek, reflective, and appear to be structural supports for the creature-like form. Their placement and function—supporting the entire entity—are consistent with limbs in a biological or mechanical organism. Given that the minarets are absent and replaced by these new, leg-like structures, it is clear that the original minarets have been replaced in this artistic rendition. Thus, the transformation aligns with the description of replacing the minarets with limb-like supports.",

      "question": "Are there glowing, intricate patterns resembling Byzantine art covering parts of the structure’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the creature-like structure features numerous glowing, ornamental patterns, particularly on the wings. These patterns include circular motifs, filigree designs, and radiant light effects that resemble both celestial imagery and decorative art styles. While Byzantine art is known for its use of gold, mosaics, and religious symbolism, the patterns here are more futuristic and stylized. However, the aesthetic—rich, detailed, and luminous—does evoke a sense of Byzantine opulence, especially in the use of gold and symmetry. The glowing elements suggest a fusion of ancient artistic traditions with modern or sci-fi interpretations. Although not strictly Byzantine in style, the visual language shares thematic similarities, such as intricate ornamentation and sacred geometry. Therefore, while not exact replicas, the patterns do resemble Byzantine-inspired art in their complexity and grandeur.",

      "question": "Has the central dome been replaced with a large, jewel-like object that displays cosmic imagery such as stars, nebulae, or galaxies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central dome of the Hagia Sophia has been transformed into a spherical, reflective surface that resembles a giant gemstone or orb. At its center is a vivid, oval-shaped window displaying a dynamic cosmic scene filled with stars, nebulae, and swirling galaxies. This imagery evokes deep space and celestial phenomena, giving the impression of a portal or a mystical eye. Unlike the original dome in Image A, which is a solid, historical architectural feature made of stone and tiles, this version is entirely reimagined as a luminous, otherworldly object. The transformation clearly replaces the traditional dome with a fantastical, jewel-like element containing cosmic visuals. This change is consistent with the overall surreal and imaginative theme of the edited image.",
