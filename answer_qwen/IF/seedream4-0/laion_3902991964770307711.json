      "question": "Are the three top portions of the candelabra replaced with transparent, tapered glass perfume caps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top portions of the candelabra are indeed transparent and have a geometric, faceted shape resembling cut crystal or glass. These shapes are consistent with the form of perfume caps, particularly those used in high-end perfumes, which often feature a diamond-like or multifaceted design to reflect light. The transparency and angular facets suggest they are made of glass or acrylic, and their placement at the ends of the arms mimics how perfume caps would be affixed. Given that these elements are not traditional candle holders but rather decorative caps, and considering their visual similarity to perfume bottle tops, it is reasonable to conclude that they are intended to resemble transparent, tapered glass perfume caps.",

      "question": "Have the curved arms connecting the top portions been replaced with sleek, seamless gold-finish tubing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the arms connecting the central column to the top portions are smooth, continuous, and exhibit a uniform gold finish without visible seams or joints. The curvature is fluid and modern, lacking ornamental detailing such as fluting or beadwork seen in traditional designs. This sleekness and uninterrupted surface strongly suggest the use of seamless tubing, likely metal coated in gold. In contrast to Image A, where the arms appear more classical with defined joints and a silver finish, Image B's arms are minimalist and refined, aligning with the description of 'sleek, seamless gold-finish tubing.'",

      "question": "Is there a minimalist brand logo embossed on the base of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the object in Image B features a circular, flat design with an engraved pattern around its perimeter. At the center of this base, there is a distinct embossed symbol — a stylized letter 'M' enclosed within a circle. This emblem is simple and elegant, fitting the definition of a minimalist brand logo. The use of a single monogram-like mark in a clean, uncluttered style is typical of luxury branding. Therefore, based on visual evidence and common branding practices, the presence of a minimalist logo can be confirmed.",

      "question": "Are intricate floral-engraved patterns visible across the surface of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the only area with engraved patterns is the base, which features a delicate floral motif surrounding the central logo. However, the rest of the object — including the central tube and the arms — lacks any such engravings. The surfaces are smooth and reflective, emphasizing simplicity and minimalism. While the base does contain floral engraving, the phrase 'across the surface of the object' implies widespread decoration, which is not accurate. Thus, although some floral engraving exists, it is limited to the base and not present throughout the entire object.",

      "question": "Is there a subtle, elegant script font label positioned on the central tube of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the central tube of the object in Image B, there is a white rectangular label with text written in a flowing, cursive script. The word 'Swept' appears to be the primary text, followed by smaller, less legible characters below. The font style is clearly elegant and artistic, fitting the description of a 'subtle, elegant script font.' Its placement on the central tube is prominent yet tasteful, suggesting intentional branding. This matches the characteristics of a product label designed for aesthetic appeal and brand recognition. Therefore, the presence of such a label is confirmed.",
