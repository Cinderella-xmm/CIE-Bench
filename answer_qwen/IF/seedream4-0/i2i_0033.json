        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a stylized illustration of a man in mid-air, with dynamic lines around his feet suggesting motion and impact. This pose is reminiscent of actions seen in extreme sports such as skateboarding, parkour, or freerunning, where individuals are often depicted jumping or performing acrobatic moves. The text 'Extreme Sports Series' at the bottom of the image explicitly labels the theme, reinforcing the connection to extreme sports. Additionally, the energetic posture and urban-style background further support this interpretation. Combining visual cues like motion lines, body position, and textual labeling with common knowledge about how extreme sports are visually represented in media confirms that the image is themed around extreme sports.",

      "question": "Is the person in the edited image shown in a jumping pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the individual is depicted with both feet off the ground, knees bent, and arms outstretched for balanceâ€”classic indicators of a jump. The positioning of the legs and the presence of motion lines beneath the feet suggest upward momentum and airborne movement. This posture is consistent with a jumping action, commonly seen in illustrations of athletic or acrobatic movements. Even without prior knowledge of the original photo, the visual cues in the edited version clearly indicate a jump. Comparing this to Image A, where the person is standing still and facing forward, the transformation into a dynamic jump in Image B is a clear artistic alteration meant to convey motion and energy.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uses thick, black outlines around the figure and clothing, which is characteristic of comic book or graphic novel art styles. These outlines define shapes sharply and separate them from the background, creating a strong contrast that mimics hand-drawn illustrations. The style includes simplified shading and stylized details (like the pattern on the tie), further enhancing the cartoonish, illustrative quality. This technique is commonly used in graphic design to give images a sketch-like or animated feel. In contrast, Image A is a photographic portrait with natural gradients and soft edges, lacking any such outlines. The stark difference in rendering between the two images supports the conclusion that Image B has been stylized with bold, hand-drawn-like outlines.",

      "question": "Are abstract graffiti elements visible within the background of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background behind the illustrated figure contains colorful, chaotic markings with angular lines, splashes of color, and abstract letterforms typical of graffiti art. These elements are not realistic but stylized representations of urban street art. They appear layered and fragmented, contributing to a sense of urban energy and rebellion, often associated with extreme sports culture. The use of red, blue, and black spray-paint-like strokes adds to the graffiti aesthetic. While Image A has a blurred, indistinct background with no such elements, Image B deliberately incorporates these graffiti motifs to enhance the theme. This artistic choice aligns with common visual tropes in urban-themed illustrations, confirming the presence of abstract graffiti.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outer frame of the edited image shows a rough, cracked surface resembling weathered concrete. This texture is particularly visible around the edges of the central illustration, especially in the corners and along the sides. It appears to be a digital overlay designed to mimic an aged wall, adding depth and realism to the urban setting. This textured backdrop contrasts with the clean white area where the character is drawn, emphasizing the graffiti elements and giving the image a gritty, street-level atmosphere. In comparison, Image A has a smooth, softly blurred background with no texture, indicating a standard photograph taken in a public space. The inclusion of a concrete texture in Image B is a deliberate stylistic choice to evoke an urban environment, consistent with themes of street art and extreme sports.",
