      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly shows a transformation of the original kitchen scene into a stylized representation where all surfaces—including the cabinets, countertop, sink, and skateboard—are rendered with fragmented, multi-colored sections separated by dark outlines resembling lead cames. This is characteristic of stained glass art, where colored glass pieces are arranged in geometric patterns and held together by metal frames. The visual cues such as angular divisions, bright hues (red, blue, yellow, green), and dark borders strongly align with the aesthetic of stained glass windows. These features are consistent across the entire scene, confirming the presence of a stained glass effect.",

      "question": "Are the skateboard, kitchen sink, and cabinets outlined with vivid geometric designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, every object—skateboard, kitchen sink, and cabinets—is composed of sharp, angular segments filled with vibrant colors and bounded by dark lines that mimic the leading in stained glass. The skateboard's deck is divided into irregular polygonal shapes, each filled with a different color, and similarly, the cabinets and sink area feature complex geometric patterns. These designs are not just decorative but structural to the overall visual style, emphasizing sharp edges and bold contrasts. The use of geometric segmentation is pervasive and intentional, indicating that these objects are indeed outlined with vivid geometric designs.",

      "question": "Does the image incorporate intricate patterns and vibrant colors reminiscent of a cathedral window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image’s visual style closely mirrors that of traditional stained glass cathedral windows, particularly in its use of rich, saturated colors and complex geometric arrangements. The arched background above the sink resembles Gothic arches commonly found in cathedrals, and the color palette—featuring deep blues, reds, yellows, and greens—echoes typical stained glass motifs. Furthermore, the way light appears to refract through the colored segments enhances the illusion of illuminated glass. These elements, combined with the overall composition, evoke the grandeur and artistry associated with cathedral stained glass.",

      "question": "Is the overall design of the image visually striking with a clear emphasis on geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is highly stylized, with every surface transformed into a mosaic of angular, interlocking shapes. The dominant visual theme is geometry—triangles, quadrilaterals, and irregular polygons dominate the composition. The contrast between the dark outlines and bright interior colors intensifies the visual impact, making the image dynamic and eye-catching. The uniform application of this geometric treatment across all objects reinforces the emphasis on shape and structure, resulting in a design that is both bold and cohesive. This level of stylization ensures the image is visually striking.",

      "question": "Do the skateboard, kitchen sink, and cabinets stand out prominently due to the applied stained glass and geometric design effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite being part of a unified artistic style, the skateboard, kitchen sink, and cabinets retain their recognizable forms while being reimagined through the stained glass motif. The skateboard, for instance, maintains its elongated shape and wheel placement, but its surface is now a kaleidoscope of colors and angles, drawing attention. Similarly, the sink and cabinets are clearly identifiable, yet their integration into the geometric pattern makes them visually prominent within the scene. The contrast between the familiar household objects and their fantastical rendering enhances their prominence, ensuring they are central to the viewer’s perception.",
