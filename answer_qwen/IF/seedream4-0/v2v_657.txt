    "Question": "Q1: Is the individual depicted within a Funko Pop figure box in an isometric perspective?",
    "explanation": "The image shows a Funko Pop figure inside a box, which is positioned at an angle that allows visibility of the front, side, and top surfaces. This angled view is characteristic of an isometric perspective, where three dimensions are visible without distortion, commonly used in product photography to showcase packaging. The box appears to be shot from a slightly elevated angle, giving depth and allowing viewers to see multiple sides simultaneously. This aligns with standard practices in commercial photography for collectibles, especially Funko Pop boxes, which often use such angles to highlight design elements. Therefore, the depiction is consistent with an isometric or near-isometric viewpoint.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the box feature the title “SKATEBOARDER”?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining the front of the box in Image B, the word 'SKATEBOARDER' is clearly printed in bold, uppercase letters along the bottom edge of the box. This is a common labeling practice for Funko Pop figures, where the character or theme is identified on the packaging. The text is legible and matches the style typically used by Funko for their product lines. There is no ambiguity in the text's presence or content, making it evident that the title is indeed 'SKATEBOARDER'.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a chibi-style figurine inside the box, accompanied by a skateboard, a helmet, jeans, and a black shirt?",
    "explanation": "The figurine inside the box exhibits the classic chibi-style design associated with Funko Pop figures—large head, small body, exaggerated facial features. It is wearing a black helmet, blue jeans, and a black t-shirt, consistent with typical skateboarding attire. A skateboard is also present in the figure’s hand, resting on the base of the display. These accessories are standard for themed Funko Pop figures and match the visual cues in the image. The combination of clothing, accessories, and stylized proportions confirms the description provided in the question.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a realistic depiction of the figurine placed outside the box, featuring detailed textures and lighting?",
    "explanation": "Outside the box, there is a second figurine that appears identical to the one inside. However, this version is rendered with enhanced realism—smooth surface textures, accurate shadows, reflections, and lighting effects that simulate a physical object under studio lighting. The details such as the sheen on the helmet, the fabric texture of the jeans, and the subtle highlights on the plastic suggest a highly realistic rendering rather than a simple toy representation. This level of detail indicates a digital enhancement or photorealistic modeling technique, distinguishing it from the stylized look of the actual Funko Pop figure. Thus, the figurine outside the box is presented in a realistic manner.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the overall design of the image conform to the Funko Pop figure box style?",
    "explanation": "The box in Image B follows the standard Funko Pop packaging design: white background with a clear plastic window, the 'POP!' logo in a speech bubble, a numbered label ('00'), and thematic artwork on the top and sides. The character illustration on the box matches the style of Funko’s branding, including the cartoonish face and pose. Additionally, the inclusion of the character name and thematic elements like graffiti in the background aligns with how Funko markets its collectibles. The overall layout, typography, and color scheme are consistent with official Funko Pop product designs. Therefore, the image conforms to the expected style.",
