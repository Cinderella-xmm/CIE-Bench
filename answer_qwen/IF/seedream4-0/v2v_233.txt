    "Question": "Q1: Is the leaf enclosed within a transparent spherical container resembling a snow globe?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf is clearly visible inside a transparent, spherical object that has a dome-like shape and is mounted on a dark base. This structure matches the typical design of a snow globe. The presence of internal elements such as water ripples, snowflakes, and golden sparkles further supports this identification. The transparency allows full visibility of the leaf, and the overall form and context are consistent with a snow globe. Therefore, based on visual cues and common knowledge about snow globes, it can be concluded that the leaf is indeed enclosed within such a container.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the snow globe placed on a surface resembling a tabletop near a window?",
    "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B is resting on a flat, wooden-textured surface that appears to be a tabletop or windowsill. The lighting suggests natural sunlight coming from behind the globe, casting soft shadows and highlights consistent with light entering through a nearby window. Additionally, the background shows a blurred view of what looks like a window frame and outdoor scenery, reinforcing the idea that the globe is positioned near a window. These visual cues, combined with everyday experience of placing decorative items like snow globes on surfaces near windows for optimal lighting, support the conclusion that the globe is on a tabletop near a window.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the background softly blurred and contains warm tones such as orange or yellow?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is indeed softly blurred, indicating a shallow depth of field commonly used in photography to emphasize the subject. The color palette includes warm hues—specifically shades of orange, yellow, and golden light—that suggest sunlight streaming through a window during sunrise or sunset. These warm tones contribute to a cozy, serene atmosphere. The blurring effect enhances the focus on the snow globe while maintaining the impression of a sunlit environment outside. Based on both visual observation and understanding of lighting effects in indoor scenes, the description aligns with the observed background.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are there golden sparkles scattered within the snow globe due to sunlight filtering through?",
    "explanation": "Inside the snow globe in Image B, there are numerous small, bright points of light that resemble golden sparkles. These appear concentrated toward the upper portion of the globe, where sunlight seems to enter from the background. The distribution and glow of these particles are consistent with how light interacts with suspended glitter or reflective particles when illuminated by direct sunlight. Given that the scene is lit by warm, directional sunlight, it is reasonable to infer that the sparkles are caused by sunlight filtering through the globe and reflecting off tiny particles within. This phenomenon is typical in snow globes, especially when placed in sunlight.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the leaf suspended in water with visible gentle ripples and delicate snowflakes drifting around inside the snow globe?",
    "explanation": "Within the snow globe in Image B, the leaf appears to float above a layer of white material resembling snow at the bottom. There are concentric circular patterns beneath the leaf that resemble ripples in water, suggesting the presence of liquid. Additionally, faint snowflake shapes are visible throughout the globe, some appearing to drift slowly, which is characteristic of snow globes. While the snowflakes may be static illustrations rather than actual moving ones, their placement and style mimic the appearance of falling snow. The combination of ripples, snowflakes, and the floating leaf strongly implies a simulated aquatic environment inside the globe. Thus, based on visual evidence and the typical design of snow globes, the description holds true.",
    "answer": "Yes"
