      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall composition stylized with strong geometric lines, symmetry, and decorative elements typical of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image displays a highly stylized aesthetic characterized by sharp angles, symmetrical forms, and a sense of verticality and elegance. The figure is composed of angular, faceted planes that mimic crystalline or metallic structures, which are hallmarks of Art Deco design. The background features a gradient sunset with bold horizontal bands of color—orange, red, and purple—commonly seen in Art Deco-inspired visuals for their dramatic and luxurious feel. Additionally, the use of repeating linear patterns on the chair and the overall balanced composition reinforce the symmetry and decorative nature typical of the Art Deco movement. These visual cues align closely with the defining characteristics of Art Deco, which emphasize geometry, glamour, and modernity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the suit’s contours replaced with bold, angular geometric shapes in metallic silver and blue colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suit in the image is not rendered in traditional fabric folds but instead consists of sharply defined, angular facets that resemble polished metal. These facets create a three-dimensional, almost crystalline appearance, particularly evident in the shoulders, lapels, and sleeves. The dominant colors are metallic silver and deep blue, which are applied in high contrast to enhance the geometric structure. This transformation from organic clothing to abstract, polygonal forms reflects a deliberate artistic choice to stylize the attire in a manner consistent with modernist and Art Deco aesthetics, where materials like chrome and glass were often symbolically represented through geometric abstraction.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chair feature sleek, linear, or repeating decorative patterns consistent with Art Deco streamlining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chair in the image is designed with clean, vertical lines and a minimalist yet elegant form. Its backrest and seat consist of parallel, elongated strips that create a sense of rhythm and repetition, a common trait in Art Deco design aimed at conveying speed, modernity, and precision. The metallic finish and reflective surfaces further enhance its streamlined appearance, reminiscent of industrial design motifs popular during the Art Deco era. These features—linear repetition, smooth surfaces, and an emphasis on verticality—are all characteristic of Art Deco's focus on modern engineering and decorative elegance.",

      "question": "Is the background a gradient transitioning through warm sunset colors such as orange, red, and purple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the image clearly shows a gradient sky that transitions from deep purple at the top, through vibrant reds and oranges in the middle, to a darker hue near the horizon. This color progression mimics a dramatic sunset, with warm tones dominating the central portion of the image. Such a palette is commonly used in Art Deco and retro-futuristic art to evoke a sense of grandeur and theatricality. The presence of a setting sun partially visible behind the figure reinforces the interpretation of a sunset scene, making the description accurate.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the figure maintained its original seated pose with arms crossed and facial features (such as the mustache and closed eyes) clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is seated in a pose that closely mirrors the original posture from Image A: arms crossed, leaning slightly forward, and resting one arm on the back of the chair. However, there is a key difference in the facial expression: while the original sketch shows closed eyes, the edited version depicts open eyes, suggesting a shift in the subject’s state of awareness or intent. The prominent mustache remains a defining feature and is preserved in both images. Therefore, although the general seated pose is retained, the facial feature of closed eyes has been altered to open eyes, which means the full original facial expression is not preserved.",
