      "question": "Is the image presented as a snow globe resting on a rustic wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B clearly show a transparent spherical object with a black base, which is characteristic of a snow globe. Inside this sphere, there are miniature figures and elements resembling a baseball scene. The snow globe is placed on a weathered wooden surface that appears to be a shelf or bench, with visible grain and texture consistent with rustic wood. The overall composition, including the positioning and lighting, supports the interpretation that this is indeed a snow globe resting on a wooden shelf. This conclusion is based on common knowledge of snow globes and their typical presentation.",

      "question": "Are the surroundings faded into a vintage baseball clubhouse backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the snow globe features a building with a sign reading 'TWINS,' a chain-link fence, and a structure that resembles a classic baseball dugout or clubhouse. The colors are warm and slightly desaturated, giving a nostalgic, vintage feel. The lighting suggests a soft glow, possibly from sunlight, enhancing the aged appearance. These elements—such as the signage, architectural style, and color tone—are consistent with a vintage baseball clubhouse setting. The background is intentionally blurred, creating a sense of depth and focusing attention on the snow globe, which aligns with artistic choices often used in such scenes.",

      "question": "Does soft sunlight filter through the globe, creating warm, golden reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B shows a bright source coming from the upper left, casting a warm, golden hue across the scene. This light interacts with the transparent surface of the snow globe, producing subtle reflections and highlights, particularly on the glass dome and within the interior. The glow around the edges of the globe and the way it illuminates the snow and grass inside suggest that sunlight is filtering through. The warm tones and soft shadows further support the presence of natural sunlight, contributing to a cozy, nostalgic atmosphere. This effect is commonly seen in scenes involving morning or late afternoon sunlight.",

      "question": "Are the characters inside the globe depicted as cheerful chibi-style 3D figures in baseball uniforms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the snow globe, there are two small figurines with exaggerated heads, large eyes, and simplified facial features—hallmarks of the chibi art style. They are wearing white pinstriped baseball uniforms with 'TWINS' written across the chest and blue helmets marked with a red 'C.' Their expressions are smiling, conveying cheerfulness. These figures are three-dimensional and proportionally stylized, consistent with collectible chibi-style models. This matches the description of cheerful chibi-style 3D figures in baseball uniforms.",

      "question": "Does the interior scene include a tiny baseball field with bats propped against the fence and a light layer of snow on the grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the snow globe, the base includes a patch of green grass with a small brown diamond-shaped area representing home plate, indicating a miniature baseball field. Two wooden bats are positioned upright near the back, leaning against a chain-link fence, which is part of the scene's backdrop. A thin layer of white material, resembling snow, covers parts of the grass and the ground around the figures. This setup accurately reflects a scaled-down baseball field with props like bats and snow, consistent with the whimsical, wintery theme of a snow globe.",
