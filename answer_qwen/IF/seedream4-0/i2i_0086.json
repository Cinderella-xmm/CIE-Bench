      "question": "Has a butterfly been added above the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a butterfly is clearly visible within the circular mirror, positioned slightly above the center of the reflection. The butterfly appears to be superimposed or digitally added, as it does not cast any shadow or interact with the physical environment in a realistic way. Its placement is directly in the upper portion of the mirror's reflection, which suggests it was intentionally placed there for aesthetic effect. This is not something one would expect to see naturally in a bathroom setting unless it were part of a decorative installation or digital enhancement. Therefore, based on visual cues and common sense about real-world objects, the butterfly has been added digitally.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly golden in appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B exhibits a bright, metallic yellow hue that closely resembles gold. Its wings reflect light in a way consistent with a shiny, reflective surface, typical of golden materials. Given that gold is often used in luxury design elements and matches the warm lighting tone around the mirror, the choice of color enhances the aesthetic harmony of the scene. This golden appearance is intentional and aligns with the modern, high-end decor style of the bathroom. Thus, based on visual analysis and understanding of color symbolism in interior design, the butterfly is indeed golden in appearance.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly placed above rather than beside or below the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the position of the butterfly in Image B, it is located in the upper central region of the mirror’s reflection. It is not aligned with the sides or lower part of the mirror but instead hovers above the center, suggesting a deliberate placement to draw attention upward. In terms of spatial orientation, 'above' refers to a position higher than the main focal point (the sink), and this butterfly occupies such a location. There are no butterflies on the sides or beneath the mirror. Therefore, based on spatial reasoning and visual positioning, the butterfly is correctly described as being placed above the mirror.",

      "question": "Does the butterfly blend naturally with the lighting around the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting around the mirror emits a warm, golden glow that matches the color of the butterfly. The butterfly itself reflects this ambient light, appearing luminous and almost glowing, which creates a cohesive visual effect. However, despite the color harmony, the butterfly lacks realistic shadows or depth that would suggest it exists within the same physical space as the light source. It appears flat and two-dimensional, indicating it is likely a digital overlay. While the color blends well, the lack of natural interaction with the environment (e.g., soft shadows, refraction) means it does not fully integrate into the scene. Thus, while visually harmonious, it does not blend naturally in a physical sense.",

      "question": "Does the butterfly maintain harmony with the overall environment of the bathroom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bathroom features a minimalist, modern design with neutral tones—marble walls, black cabinetry, and warm accent lighting. The addition of a golden butterfly introduces an element of fantasy or artistry, which contrasts with the otherwise clean and functional aesthetic. However, the golden color complements the warm lighting and adds a touch of elegance, fitting within the luxurious theme. While not a typical bathroom feature, the butterfly serves as a decorative focal point that enhances the ambiance without disrupting the balance. Given that artistic elements like symbolic motifs are sometimes used in high-end interiors for emotional impact, the butterfly maintains harmony through its color coordination and subtle presence. Therefore, considering both design principles and contextual aesthetics, the butterfly contributes positively to the environment.",
