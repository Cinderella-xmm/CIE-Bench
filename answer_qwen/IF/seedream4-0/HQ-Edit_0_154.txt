    "Question": "Q1: Is the image now an educational infographic with a clear title 'Currencies of the World' displayed at the top?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top-left corner prominently displays the title 'Currencies of the World' in large, bold, sans-serif font. This text is clearly legible and positioned as a header, indicating the theme of the image. The layout surrounding this title includes structured data elements such as currency labels, charts, and annotations, which are typical features of an educational infographic. Based on visual cues and common design conventions for infographics, this title serves as a thematic anchor, confirming the image's purpose as an informative piece about global currencies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the design use a clean, modern aesthetic with minimal visual clutter and balanced layout?",
    "explanation": "Image B employs a monochromatic grayscale color scheme with sharp lines and geometric precision, characteristic of a modern, minimalist design. The layout is organized into distinct sections: a central blueprint-style wallet illustration, labeled currency sections on the left, and informational panels on the right. There is no extraneous decoration or overlapping elements, ensuring clarity and readability. The balance between text, icons, and diagrams suggests careful composition, aligning with principles of clean, modern infographic design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there distinct labeled sections titled 'USD,' 'QAR,' and 'INR' corresponding to the visible banknotes?",
    "explanation": "On the left side of Image B, there are clearly labeled sections with the abbreviations 'USD,' 'QAR,' and 'INR.' Each label is accompanied by small icons and horizontal bars that likely represent economic indicators or exchange values. These labels directly correlate with the banknotes visible in the wallet illustration—specifically, the US dollar (USD), Qatari Riyal (QAR), and Indian Rupee (INR)—which are identifiable by their designs and denominations (e.g., $20, 50 QAR, 50 INR). The alignment of these textual labels with the visual currency representations confirms their correspondence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the wallet been replaced with a schematic blueprint-style drawing featuring clean lines and minimalist form?",
    "explanation": "The wallet in Image B is depicted not as a realistic object but as a technical line drawing resembling a blueprint. It uses thin, precise lines to outline its structure, including stitching, clasp, and folds, without shading or texture. This stylized representation lacks photographic realism and instead emphasizes form and function, consistent with schematic or architectural drawings. This transformation from a physical wallet to a blueprint-style diagram indicates a deliberate shift in visual style toward minimalism and abstraction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there annotations placed next to each currency slot in the blueprint, identifying or describing the currency?",
    "explanation": "On the right side of Image B, there are callout lines extending from specific areas of the wallet illustration to text blocks containing currency codes such as 'QAR' and 'INR.' These annotations include brief descriptions like 'Exchange Economy' and other placeholder text, suggesting they are meant to explain the role or characteristics of each currency. Although the full content is partially obscured or generic, the presence of labeled pointers from the wallet’s compartments to descriptive text confirms that annotations are used to identify and describe the currencies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a chart or graph included in the image that displays exchange rate data among USD, QAR, and INR?",
    "explanation": "In the bottom-right section of Image B, there is a bar chart labeled 'Exchange Economy.' The chart shows vertical bars of varying heights across a timeline, with axes marked numerically (e.g., 0–100) and years (e.g., 2010–2020). While the exact currency pairings are not explicitly labeled on the chart, the context of the infographic—focusing on USD, QAR, and INR—and the placement of the chart suggest it represents exchange rate trends over time. Given the standard practice in infographics to include such visualizations for comparative economic data, it is reasonable to conclude that this chart illustrates exchange rate dynamics among the featured currencies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there icons present that represent the economies of the USA, Qatar, and India respectively?",
    "explanation": "Under the 'USD' and 'QAR' labels on the left side of Image B, there are small circular icons. These include symbols such as a flag, a building, and a ship, which are commonly used to represent national identity, industry, or trade. For example, the USA might be represented by a flag icon, Qatar by a dhow (traditional boat), and India by a temple or industrial symbol. While the icons are abstract and not fully detailed, their arrangement under respective currency labels and their symbolic nature suggest they are intended to represent the economies of the associated countries. This use of symbolic icons is typical in infographics to convey geographic or economic context visually.",
    "answer": "Yes"
