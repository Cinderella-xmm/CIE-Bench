      "question": "Is the phrase 'Stories Through Time' present in the image using an elegant serif typeface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phrase 'Stories Through Time' is clearly visible on the right side of the typewriter. The font used has distinct characteristics of a serif typeface—specifically, it features small decorative strokes (serifs) at the ends of the letters, such as the crossbars on the 'T' and the terminal flourishes on the 'S' and 'e'. These traits are typical of elegant serif fonts often used in vintage or literary contexts. Additionally, the letterforms are proportioned with classic balance and spacing, reinforcing the impression of an elegant serif style. This aligns with common design practices where serif fonts are chosen to evoke tradition, sophistication, and timelessness—especially appropriate for a theme involving stories and history.",

      "question": "Is the text 'Stories Through Time' rendered in a distressed gold color that matches the typewriter’s metallic tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Stories Through Time' in Image B appears in a golden hue with subtle texture variations that give it a weathered or aged appearance—consistent with a 'distressed' effect. The color closely complements the dark metallic tones of the typewriter, which itself has a patina-like finish suggesting age and use. The gold color enhances the vintage aesthetic while harmonizing with the warm sepia lighting and metallic surfaces. In design terms, this choice of color not only evokes antiquity but also creates visual continuity between the typography and the machinery, reinforcing the theme of timeless storytelling. The distressing adds authenticity, mimicking wear over time, which is consistent with the overall narrative tone of the image.",

      "question": "Has a sepia filter been applied uniformly across the entire image to create an aged effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a consistent warm, monochromatic brownish-yellow tone throughout, characteristic of a sepia filter. This effect is applied evenly across all elements—the typewriter, desk, lamp, mug, and background—creating a unified aged appearance. Sepia filters are commonly used in photography and digital art to simulate old photographs and evoke nostalgia. The uniformity of the tone suggests a deliberate post-processing application rather than localized coloring. Moreover, the absence of vibrant colors or contrasting hues supports the conclusion that a global sepia filter was used to enhance the vintage feel. This technique is standard in creating retro or historical aesthetics, especially in thematic compositions like literary posters.",

      "question": "Are there visible swirling, translucent pages emanating from the typewriter, appearing as if stories are emerging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, in Image B, multiple sheets of paper are depicted rising from the typewriter in a dynamic, swirling motion. These pages are semi-transparent and appear to be floating upward, resembling smoke or ethereal energy. The handwriting on the pages is faintly visible, reinforcing the idea that they contain written stories. Their movement and translucency suggest a magical or metaphorical emergence of narratives from the machine. This visual metaphor is a creative device often used in artistic representations to symbolize the birth of ideas or literature. The effect is enhanced by the lighting and shadow, giving depth and realism to the otherwise surreal element.",

      "question": "Does the image feature a decorative Art Deco-style border framing the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The border surrounding Image B consists of geometric patterns with angular lines, symmetrical motifs, and ornamental corners—hallmarks of the Art Deco design style popular in the 1920s–1930s. The frame includes repeating linear designs and stylized corner embellishments that are typical of Art Deco aesthetics, which often incorporate symmetry, luxury, and modernist geometry. This border not only frames the central image but also contributes to the vintage and theatrical feel of the composition. Such borders are frequently used in retro posters and book covers to convey elegance and timelessness, making them a fitting choice for a literary-themed artwork.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do all visual elements (text, color scheme, ghostly pages, border) collectively contribute to a cohesive vintage literary poster aesthetic focused on storytelling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All elements in Image B work together synergistically to create a unified vintage literary poster aesthetic. The sepia tone establishes an aged, nostalgic atmosphere; the Art Deco border adds elegance and period-specific flair; the distressed gold text reinforces the theme of enduring stories; and the swirling translucent pages visually represent the act of creation and the transcendence of stories through time. Together, these components form a narrative-rich composition that centers on the idea of storytelling as a timeless, almost magical process. The typewriter serves as both a literal and symbolic centerpiece, linking past writing tools with the imagination. This cohesive design language aligns perfectly with the concept of a promotional or thematic poster celebrating literature across eras.",
