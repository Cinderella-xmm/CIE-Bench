      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a visible, cartoon-style face with expressive features (eyes, mouth, etc.) drawn on the frame near the handlebars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area near the handlebars of the bicycle's frame has been stylized to include a cartoon face. The face features large, round eyes and a wide, smiling mouth, which are typical characteristics of animated or comic-style characters. This facial design is positioned where the head tube meets the top tube, giving the impression that the bike itself has a personality. This transformation is consistent with anthropomorphism commonly seen in cartoons, where inanimate objects are given human-like traits. Based on visual cues, the presence of these expressive features confirms the existence of a cartoon-style face.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there cartoon-style limbs (arms or legs) visibly extending from the front and/or rear wheel hubs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no visible limbs such as arms or legs extending from the wheel hubs. Instead, the pedals have been stylized with yellow and red elements resembling boots or feet, but these are not actual limbs attached to the wheels. In contrast, the original bike in Image A does not have any such additions. The modification in Image B focuses on adding character to the bike through facial features and motion effects rather than giving it physical limbs. Therefore, while there are stylized foot-like pedal designs, there are no cartoon-style limbs extending from the wheel hubs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there dynamic motion lines (such as streaks or curved lines) surrounding the bike or its wheels to indicate speed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes several black, angular lines beneath the wheels and along the sides of the bike, particularly near the rear wheel and front wheel. These lines are characteristic of motion effects used in comic books and animations to convey movement and speed. They are angled backward, suggesting forward momentum. Such visual cues are standard in graphic storytelling to imply rapid motion. In comparison, Image A lacks any such lines, presenting a static, realistic depiction. Thus, the presence of these motion lines in Image B clearly indicates an intentional artistic choice to depict speed.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the red frame been redesigned to resemble a superhero suit, including visual elements like patterns, textures, or symbols associated with a hero costume?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the red frame of the bike in Image B remains largely unchanged in color and basic structure compared to Image A, there are no additional patterns, textures, or symbols (like capes, emblems, or armor-like detailing) that would suggest a superhero suit design. The frame retains its original sleek appearance, albeit with added cartoon features like a face and exaggerated proportions. There is no evidence of thematic elements typically associated with superhero costumes—such as stars, lightning bolts, or layered fabric textures. Therefore, although the bike is personified, it does not visually transform into a superhero suit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there comic-style sound effect texts such as “Vroom!” or “Zoom!” overlaid on the image in a stylized, bold font typical of comic books?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly features two prominent sound effect texts: 'Vroom!' inside a yellow starburst shape on the left side and 'Zoom!' in large, orange, bold letters with a black outline on the right. These text styles are classic examples of comic book sound effects, designed to emphasize action and energy. The use of bold fonts, contrasting colors, and explosive shapes aligns perfectly with traditional comic aesthetics. In contrast, Image A contains no text or sound effects, maintaining a clean product shot. The addition of these elements in Image B enhances the playful, animated tone.",

      "question": "Does the entire image exhibit a comic book aesthetic, including exaggerated features, bold lines, vibrant colors, and dynamic composition consistent with a lively animated character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits multiple hallmarks of a comic book aesthetic: the bike has been anthropomorphized with a cartoon face, dynamic motion lines, stylized sound effects ('Vroom!', 'Zoom!'), and exaggerated proportions (e.g., oversized pedals resembling feet). The use of bold outlines, high-contrast colors (especially the bright red frame), and energetic composition all contribute to a lively, animated feel. Compared to Image A, which is a straightforward, realistic product photograph, Image B transforms the bike into a character with personality and movement. This shift reflects a deliberate artistic style consistent with comic book illustrations, where objects are dramatized for entertainment and visual impact.",
