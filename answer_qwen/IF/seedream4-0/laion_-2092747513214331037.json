      "question": "Are sleek, metallic textures visible on both the cyclist and the escort car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cyclist is depicted wearing a full-body suit with a highly reflective, chrome-like finish that gives off a metallic sheen. This texture is consistent across the suit and helmet, suggesting a futuristic or high-tech design. Similarly, the escort car also exhibits a glossy, metallic surface with enhanced reflections, particularly noticeable in the front grille and body panels. The visual cues—such as light reflections, uniform shine, and lack of fabric or matte finishes—support the conclusion that both the cyclist and the car have sleek, metallic textures. This aligns with common representations of advanced materials in sci-fi or futuristic aesthetics.",

      "question": "Are electric blue neon glow lines present along both edges of the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, bright electric blue glowing lines are clearly visible running parallel along both sides of the road. These lines are not part of the natural environment but appear as artificial enhancements, likely added digitally to emphasize speed and technology. Their consistent placement and luminous quality suggest they are intended to represent futuristic road markings or energy trails. This contrasts with typical real-world road conditions where such glow lines do not exist unless under special lighting or augmented reality effects.",

      "question": "Does the cyclist's helmet feature a transparent visor with visible digital data displays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cyclist’s helmet in Image B has a smooth, reflective surface that appears to be made of polished metal or glass. Upon closer inspection, there is a translucent section at the front of the helmet, resembling a visor. Within this visor, faint digital readouts are visible, including numerical values and graphical elements such as speed indicators and performance metrics. These details suggest an integrated heads-up display (HUD), commonly seen in futuristic or sci-fi designs. The presence of these digital overlays confirms that the visor is not just transparent but actively displaying information.",

      "question": "Are holographic cycling statistics visible near the escort car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Near the escort car in Image B, there are floating, semi-transparent screens emitting a blue glow. These screens contain various data points such as numbers, graphs, and icons related to cycling performance (e.g., '12', '900', '1238'). The layout and style resemble holograms, commonly used in futuristic interfaces to project real-time information without physical devices. These elements are positioned above and beside the car, indicating they are projected from or associated with it. Given their appearance and context, they can be reasonably interpreted as holographic cycling statistics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text at the top of Image B reads '12 WEEK PLAN' and '40K TIME TRIAL', which matches exactly with the original title seen in Image A. There is no indication of any change to the title; the font, color, and content remain identical. The phrase 'Turbocharged Trial Tactics' is not present anywhere in the image. Therefore, despite the futuristic modifications elsewhere, the title has not been altered.",

      "question": "Does the image convey a high-tech, futuristic racing theme suitable for a sci-fi-style advertisement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features numerous elements that evoke a high-tech, futuristic aesthetic: metallic surfaces on both the cyclist and car, electric blue neon lines on the road, holographic data displays, and a sleek, aerodynamic design. These visual components are characteristic of science fiction themes often used in advertisements for advanced technology or speculative sports. The combination of realistic elements (like the cyclist and car) with exaggerated, digitally enhanced features creates a stylized, immersive experience typical of sci-fi marketing. Thus, the overall tone and design strongly support a futuristic racing theme appropriate for a sci-fi-style ad.",
