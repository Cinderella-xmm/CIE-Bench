    "Question": "Q1: Has the original book illustration been replaced with a snow globe?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central object is a transparent spherical snow globe containing a small open book, resting on a bed of artificial snow. The book inside is stylized and three-dimensional, contrasting with the flat, two-dimensional illustration in Image A, which features a simple line-art depiction of an open book beneath the text 'STORY PAGES'. The snow globe replaces the original flat illustration entirely, transforming it into a whimsical, enclosed scene. This substitution indicates that the original book illustration has indeed been replaced by a more elaborate and thematic representation—the snow globe—centered around the same literary motif.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the snow globe placed on a shelf surrounded by other books?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the snow globe positioned on a wooden surface that appears to be a bookshelf. To the left and right of the snow globe are stacks of physical books with visible spines and covers, suggesting they are part of a collection. Below the shelf, additional books are arranged vertically, reinforcing the idea that this is a bookshelf environment. The presence of multiple books surrounding the snow globe confirms that it is situated among other books on a shelf.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the background depict a blurred cozy library with warm tones such as orange and yellow?",
    "explanation": "The background of Image B is softly out of focus, featuring warm lighting and indistinct shapes that resemble bookshelves filled with books. The dominant colors are warm hues like amber, orange, and yellow, particularly emanating from the illuminated lamp on the right. These visual cues, combined with the ambient glow and depth of field, suggest a cozy, inviting library or study room setting. The warmth and soft blur contribute to a serene and intimate atmosphere typical of a well-lit reading space.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a nearby lamp emitting soft golden light that refracts through the snow globe, creating sparkles?",
    "explanation": "To the right of the snow globe in Image B, there is a table lamp with a beige lampshade emitting a warm, golden light. This light source illuminates the scene and interacts with the glass surface of the snow globe, causing reflections and refractions. Inside the globe, numerous bright star-like sparkles and glowing particles are visible, which are likely created by the light passing through the glass and interacting with the internal elements (such as suspended glitter). This effect enhances the magical ambiance and aligns with the description of light refraction producing sparkle effects.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Inside the snow globe, is the book depicted as a compact, chibi-style 3D model with fluttering pages in a snowy environment?",
    "explanation": "Inside the snow globe, the book is rendered in a simplified, cartoonish style with exaggerated proportions relative to its surroundings, consistent with a 'chibi' aesthetic. It is three-dimensional, standing upright on a base of white snow, and its pages appear slightly lifted or angled, suggesting movement or fluttering. The surrounding environment includes artificial snow and floating paper fragments, reinforcing the snowy, magical theme. While the term 'chibi' is typically associated with anime-style characters, the book's stylized, miniature form fits within a broader interpretation of cute, compact design. The combination of 3D rendering, snowy base, and dynamic page appearance supports the description of a compact, stylized 3D model in motion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
