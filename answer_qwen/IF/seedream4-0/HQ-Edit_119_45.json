      "question": "Has the overall style of the sculpture been transformed into a steampunk aesthetic, featuring industrial elements like gears, copper, and brass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) presents a figure that retains the iconic form of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh's burial mask, such as Tutankhamun's, but with significant modifications. The dominant materials now appear to be copper and brass, which are characteristic of steampunk design. Industrial elements such as visible gears, cogs, and mechanical components are integrated into the collar and wings. Additionally, there is steam emanating from pipes on the collar, further reinforcing the steampunk theme. These visual cues—mechanical parts, metallic textures, and functional steam emissions—are hallmarks of the steampunk genre, which blends Victorian-era industrial design with fantastical machinery. This transformation aligns with the definition of steampunk aesthetics, where historical styles are reimagined through a lens of retro-futuristic engineering.",

      "question": "Are the stripes of the headdress now composed of or replaced by intricate brass gears and polished copper elements, while preserving the original shape and silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the headdress maintains the traditional nemes pattern—a striped headcloth associated with Egyptian royalty—with its original shape and silhouette preserved. However, the stripes themselves are not made of gears or copper elements; instead, they retain their classic blue and gold coloration, albeit with a slightly more metallic sheen. While the surrounding areas (such as the shoulders and collar) incorporate brass gears and copper, the headdress itself does not feature these mechanical components within the stripes. Therefore, although the overall aesthetic has shifted toward steampunk, the headdress stripes remain largely unchanged in composition, even if subtly enhanced with metallic tones.",

      "question": "Does the figure have mechanical wings attached to its back or shoulders, featuring visible gears, metal framework, and emerald-colored accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure clearly displays large, wing-like structures extending from the shoulders. These wings are constructed from metal, primarily copper and brass, and feature intricate gear mechanisms embedded within them. The feathers of the wings are stylized to resemble mechanical blades, and each wing includes multiple interlocking gears and riveted joints. Furthermore, green gemstones, resembling emeralds, are embedded at key points along the wings, adding decorative and symbolic accents. These elements—metallic construction, visible gears, and emerald highlights—are consistent with steampunk design principles, particularly the fusion of organic forms (wings) with industrial mechanics. Thus, the presence of mechanical wings with these features is evident.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the collar been redesigned with detailed clockwork patterns, including gears, cogs, or other mechanical components, replacing the original decorative elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The collar in Image B has undergone a dramatic transformation compared to traditional Egyptian royal collars. Instead of the usual ornate inlays of lapis lazuli, turquoise, and gold, this version incorporates numerous mechanical components. Prominent gears, cogs, and clockwork mechanisms are visibly integrated into the design, especially around the central area where a small analog clock face is mounted. The structure suggests functionality, with moving parts and layered metalwork, all consistent with steampunk motifs. The original decorative elements have been replaced entirely by these industrial features, indicating a deliberate redesign to emphasize mechanical complexity over traditional ornamentation.",

      "question": "Are there small steam exhaust pipes visible on the collar, with subtle wisps of vapor or steam emanating from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the collar in Image B includes several small, pipe-like protrusions positioned symmetrically on either side of the neck. These pipes are crafted from copper and have a mechanical appearance, consistent with industrial steam systems. From the ends of these pipes, faint plumes of white vapor or steam are visibly rising, suggesting active operation. This detail is a classic element of steampunk imagery, where steam-powered machinery is both functional and visually expressive. The presence of both the pipes and the steam confirms that this feature is intentionally included to enhance the mechanical and dynamic nature of the sculpture.",
