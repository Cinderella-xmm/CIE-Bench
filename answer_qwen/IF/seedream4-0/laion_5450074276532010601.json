      "question": "Are the two table tennis paddles illustrated as cartoon characters with distinct facial features and accessories (one with a red helmet, the other with a blue cap)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two table tennis paddles are clearly stylized as animated characters. Each paddle has a face with eyes, cheeks, and a smiling mouth, giving them anthropomorphic qualities. The paddle on the left is wearing a red helmet with visible ventilation holes and a chin strap, while the one on the right is wearing a blue baseball cap. These accessories distinguish them visually and contribute to their character-like appearance. This transformation from simple sports equipment into expressive cartoon figures aligns with common design practices in children’s or game-themed illustrations, where objects are personified for storytelling purposes. Based on visual cues and typical cartoon design logic, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image vivid and saturated, using bright tones such as red, blue, gold, and green to emphasize an adventurous theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B is highly vibrant and saturated. Bright reds (on the helmet and paddle), deep blues (on the cap and paddle), golden yellow (on the treasure chest edges and text), and lush greens (in the palm trees and background foliage) dominate the scene. These colors are not only eye-catching but also commonly associated with adventure and excitement—especially gold, which symbolizes treasure, and the tropical setting implied by the greenery and map. The use of such bold, contrasting hues enhances the playful and energetic mood, reinforcing the 'adventure' theme suggested by the title 'Ping Pong Adventure.' This deliberate choice of coloration is consistent with marketing visuals for games or children's products aiming to convey fun and action.",

      "question": "Is the box depicted as a treasure chest with visible golden edges that appear to shimmer or glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box in Image B is designed to resemble a classic treasure chest, complete with wooden planks, a metal clasp, and prominent golden trim along its edges. The golden parts are rendered with sparkles and highlights, creating a visual effect of shimmering or glowing light. This artistic treatment is often used in digital illustrations to suggest value, magic, or excitement, especially in contexts involving treasure or discovery. The chest is centrally positioned and emits rays of light upward, further enhancing the impression of radiance. Thus, based on both visual cues and common illustrative techniques, it can be concluded that the box is indeed portrayed as a gleaming treasure chest.",

      "question": "Is there a speech bubble above the paddles containing the text \"Ready for the ultimate match quest!\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A white speech bubble is clearly visible above the two cartoon paddles in Image B. Inside this bubble, the text reads exactly: 'Ready for the ultimate match quest!' The font is bold and easy to read, matching the playful tone of the illustration. Speech bubbles are standard narrative tools in cartoons and games to convey dialogue or thoughts. In this context, the message serves as a call to action, fitting the adventure theme. The presence and content of the speech bubble are unambiguous based on direct observation.",

      "question": "Are the paddles positioned as if leaping or springing from the treasure chest toward a background that features a sketched treasure map?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The two paddles are shown mid-air, angled upward and outward from the top of the treasure chest, with motion lines and sparkles beneath them suggesting dynamic movement. This posture strongly implies they are leaping or springing out of the chest. The background behind them is a detailed, hand-drawn-style treasure map with islands, ships, and markings typical of pirate maps. The combination of the paddles’ upward trajectory and the map backdrop creates a sense of adventure and discovery. This composition uses visual storytelling conventions to depict emergence from a treasure chest into an exploratory world, aligning with the game-like theme of the image.",
