      "question": "Are the chicken wings replaced with plush toy replicas made of golden-brown fabric that have a slightly crunchy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects on the white rectangular plate resemble chicken wings in shape and arrangement, but their appearance is clearly not that of cooked food. Instead, they are made of a soft, golden-brown fabric with visible stitching and a fuzzy texture, consistent with plush toys. The term 'slightly crunchy texture' contradicts the visual evidenceâ€”plush toys are soft and not crunchy. Therefore, while they are indeed plush replicas, the description of them having a 'crunchy texture' is inaccurate. Based on visual cues such as texture, material, and lack of browning or grease typical of cooked chicken, these are clearly fabric-based toys.",

      "question": "Is the sauce replaced with a soft, textured pillow in bright orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small white bowl that previously held sauce now contains a square-shaped object in bright orange. This object has a smooth, padded surface and defined edges, consistent with a small decorative pillow rather than a liquid or semi-liquid sauce. Its texture appears soft and fabric-like, lacking any signs of viscosity or consistency associated with real sauce. Given its shape, color, and texture, it is clearly a plush item designed to mimic the sauce bowl's contents, but it is not actual sauce. Thus, the sauce has been replaced with a soft, textured pillow.",

      "question": "Is the entire scene set on a smooth, light-colored wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the white plate placed on a flat surface with visible wood grain patterns and a light beige tone, characteristic of a smooth, light-colored wooden table or board. There are no signs of a dark or textured background like stone or slate. The lighting and reflections also suggest a natural, matte finish typical of wood. Comparing this to Image A, which features a dark blue-gray surface, the change in background is clear. In Image B, the surface is distinctly light and wooden, confirming the setting.",

      "question": "Are the plush wings and the orange pillow arranged in the same spatial configuration as the original chicken wings and sauce?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing Image A and Image B, we observe that the placement of the items on the white plate is nearly identical. The plush wings occupy the same positions relative to each other and to the bowl as the original chicken wings did. Similarly, the orange pillow is positioned in the same location on the plate as the original sauce was, maintaining the same spatial layout. This suggests a deliberate recreation of the original composition, preserving both form and arrangement. The alignment and spacing between objects match closely, indicating intentional replication of the original setup.",

      "question": "Do the plush wings and pillow clearly appear as fabric-based toys rather than real food items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plush wings in Image B exhibit characteristics inconsistent with real food: uniform golden-brown coloration, visible seams, soft texture, and lack of realistic details such as skin, fat, or char marks. Additionally, the 'sauce' is a solid, square pillow with no liquid properties. These elements are unmistakably crafted from fabric and designed for play or decoration. Their appearance contrasts sharply with the realistic, crispy, and greasy look of actual cooked chicken wings and sauce in Image A. Therefore, they are clearly identifiable as toys, not edible items.",
