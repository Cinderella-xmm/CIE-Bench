    "Question": "Q2: Have the zebra’s characteristic black-and-white stripes been retained?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is depicted with distinct black and white stripes covering its body, including the legs, torso, neck, and head. These stripes follow a pattern similar to those seen in real zebras, although they are stylized and more uniform. The contrast between the black and white is strong and clearly visible, which aligns with the defining visual trait of zebras. While the stripes are simplified and cartoonish, they still retain the core feature of alternating black and white patterns. Based on world knowledge, zebras are known for their unique striping, and this design preserves that essential characteristic, albeit in a more artistic form. Therefore, the stripes have been retained in a recognizable way.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the ears of the zebra in an upright position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's ears are clearly shown standing straight up, pointing forward. This posture is consistent with alertness in animals, and in this case, it contributes to the playful and animated appearance of the character. The ears are well-defined, with inner pink shading and black outlines, and they maintain an upright orientation. From a biological perspective, zebras often hold their ears upright when attentive or curious, so this depiction aligns with natural behavior. Additionally, in stylized or cartoon representations, upright ears are commonly used to convey liveliness and awareness. Thus, the ears are indeed in an upright position.",

    "Question": "Q4: Does the overall design of the zebra appear simple enough and visually appealing for use in various cultural derivative products?",
    "explanation": "The zebra in Image B has a clean, cartoon-style design with smooth lines, rounded features, and a friendly facial expression. Its proportions are exaggerated in a way typical of children’s toys or animated characters—such as a large head, big eyes, and a smiling mouth—which enhances visual appeal. The color scheme is limited to black, white, and subtle gray tones, making it visually striking yet not overwhelming. The simplicity of the design allows for easy reproduction across various media, such as plush toys, stickers, animations, or educational materials. Furthermore, the lack of complex textures or fine details makes it suitable for mass production and adaptation into different cultural contexts. Given these factors, the design is both simple and aesthetically pleasing, meeting the criteria for broad applicability in cultural derivative products.",

    "Question": "Q5: Has the design been simplified sufficiently to make it appropriate and engaging for children?",
    "explanation": "The zebra in Image B exhibits several design choices that are specifically tailored to appeal to children. It has large, expressive eyes, a smiling face, and soft, rounded contours—common traits in child-friendly illustrations and toys. The stripes are bold and evenly spaced, avoiding any intricate or confusing patterns. The limbs are short and sturdy, giving it a stable, toy-like appearance. Additionally, the absence of realistic anatomical details (like hooves or musculature) and the inclusion of a cheerful expression suggest that the design prioritizes cuteness and approachability over realism. Such simplification is standard in children’s media to ensure clarity and emotional engagement. Therefore, the design is clearly simplified and optimized to be engaging and developmentally appropriate for young audiences.",
