        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the clock tower exhibits numerous cracks and structural damage, particularly around the arches and along the stonework. The central archway is significantly damaged, with large portions of the stone missing or collapsed, exposing dark voids behind. The surface shows extensive weathering, and there are no visible signs of recent restoration work such as fresh mortar, new stone inlays, or smooth transitions between old and new materials. The cracks appear natural and consistent with long-term deterioration rather than repaired joints. Based on visual cues and architectural restoration knowledge—where repairs typically involve filling gaps with matching material and smoothing surfaces—the absence of such indicators suggests no restoration has occurred. Therefore, the cracks and broken areas have not been restored.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple sections of the clock tower show clear gaps and missing parts. The most prominent example is the large arched opening below the clock face, which is partially collapsed and reveals a hollow interior. The edges of this arch are jagged and uneven, indicating that significant stone material is missing. Additionally, smaller cracks and chipped areas are visible across the surface, especially near the top and sides of the tower. These features are consistent with structural decay and abandonment. Since these gaps are open and unpatched, and there are no signs of fill material or reconstruction, it can be concluded that many parts remain unfilled. This aligns with common observations of deteriorated historical structures where restoration has not yet taken place.",

      "question": "Do the restored parts match the original texture and color of the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any clearly restored sections. There are no visible patches of newer stone or mortar that differ in texture or color from the surrounding aged masonry. The entire structure maintains a uniform grayish tone with consistent weathering patterns, including pitting, flaking, and discoloration typical of old limestone or sandstone exposed to the elements. If restoration had occurred, one would expect differences in surface finish—such as smoother textures, lighter colors, or sharper edges—due to modern repair techniques. However, such contrasts are absent. Thus, since no restoration appears to have been done, the question of matching texture and color becomes moot. The answer must be 'No' because there are no restored parts to evaluate.",

      "question": "Does the restored clock tower maintain the original architectural style and details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The architectural style of the clock tower in Image B is Gothic Revival, identifiable by its pointed arches, ornate detailing, and spire-like top. Despite visible damage, the remaining structure still preserves key design elements such as the pointed arches, decorative moldings, and symmetrical layout. However, the term 'restored' implies prior intervention to repair or reconstruct damaged areas. Since no restoration work is evident (as established in previous questions), the tower's current state reflects degradation rather than a maintained or reconstructed form. While the original style is still recognizable due to surviving features, the presence of major structural losses undermines the completeness of the original design. Therefore, although the architectural language remains intact in concept, the physical integrity required to fully maintain the original details is compromised. Hence, the tower does not currently maintain the full original architectural expression due to lack of restoration.",

      "question": "Is the clock face intact and legible after the restoration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock face in Image B is clearly visible and appears to be intact. The Roman numerals are fully present and legible, and the hands of the clock are in place, pointing to a specific time. There are no visible cracks or missing numbers on the dial, and the glass covering (if any) seems undamaged. However, the surrounding stonework is cracked, but this does not affect the clock face itself. Importantly, there is no evidence of restoration work on the clock mechanism or face—no signs of repainting, replacement parts, or modern materials. Yet, since the clock face is functional-looking and readable despite the tower’s ruinous condition, it can be considered intact and legible. The question asks about post-transformation status, and since the clock face is undamaged and readable, it meets the criteria for being legible. No restoration is needed for it to be legible at this moment.",
