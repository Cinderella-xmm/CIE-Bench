      "question": "Is the person and giraffe depicted in a classic LEGO minifigure style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is clearly a LEGO minifigure, identifiable by its characteristic blocky proportions, yellow head with printed facial features, and articulated limbs. The figure wears a blue uniform with a cap, consistent with LEGO’s design language for human characters. The giraffe is also constructed from LEGO bricks, featuring geometric shapes and color patterns typical of LEGO animal models. Its long neck, ossicones (horn-like structures), and spotted pattern are simplified but recognizable as a LEGO interpretation. This construction method and aesthetic align perfectly with the classic LEGO minifigure style, which emphasizes modular building blocks and stylized forms rather than photorealism.",

      "question": "Does the giraffe feature matching tones and patterns inspired by the person's outfit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The person in Image B is wearing a light blue uniform, which is a dominant color in the scene. However, the giraffe is primarily composed of beige and brown LEGO bricks, with orange-brown spots mimicking natural giraffe patterning. There is no visual indication that the giraffe’s color scheme or pattern directly references or matches the blue tones of the person’s outfit. In fact, the giraffe’s colors are biologically accurate representations of real giraffes, not stylistically aligned with the uniform. Therefore, while both figures share a cohesive design language, the giraffe does not feature matching tones or patterns inspired by the person’s clothing.",

      "question": "Is the composition enclosed within a transparent glass cube?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO figures placed inside a clear, rectangular enclosure with visible edges and reflections, consistent with a glass or acrylic display case. The transparency allows full visibility of the figures inside, and the structure appears to be sealed, resembling a museum-style display. This type of casing is commonly used to protect collectibles and enhance presentation. The material is transparent, and the shape is cubic, supporting the conclusion that it is a transparent glass cube.",

      "question": "Is there a matte black base with silver accents and an engraved nameplate reading \"Giraffa Elegans\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base beneath the glass cube in Image B is indeed matte black, with clean lines and a polished finish. It features silver-colored trim along the edges, adding a refined accent. A metallic plaque is affixed to the front, engraved with the text 'Giraffa Elegans,' which is the scientific name for the giraffe species (though technically, 'Giraffa camelopardalis' is more accurate; 'Giraffa elegans' may refer to a subspecies or artistic liberty). The font and layout resemble formal taxonomic labeling, reinforcing the museum-like presentation. All elements—matte black base, silver accents, and engraved nameplate—are present and match the description.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B transitions smoothly from a deep black at the top to a lighter gray near the bottom, creating a subtle gradient effect. This lighting technique is often used in product photography to draw attention to the subject while minimizing distractions. The gradient enhances depth and highlights the display case, making the LEGO model stand out. This visual cue is consistent with studio lighting setups designed for showcasing collectibles.",
