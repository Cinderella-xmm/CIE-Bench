        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central table between the two armchairs now features a teapot instead of the previously seen black vase. The teapot is white with blue floral patterns, consistent with traditional porcelain designs. This change is clearly visible as the object's shape, color, and decorative style differ significantly from the original dark, cylindrical vase in Image A. Based on visual cues, the replacement is evident. The reasoning involves comparing the object's form (rounded body, spout, lid) and surface texture (glazed ceramic) to known characteristics of teapots versus vases.",

      "question": "Are there two porcelain cups placed on the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, only one porcelain cup is visible on the table next to the teapot. It matches the teapot in design—white with blue floral patterns—and appears to be made of the same material. There is no second cup present. In contrast, Image A shows a single black vase with dried flowers, so no cups were present originally. The absence of a second cup can be confirmed by analyzing the space on the table and the arrangement of objects. Given that tea service typically includes at least one cup per person, the presence of just one cup suggests an incomplete set. Thus, based on visual evidence, there are not two cups.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of the teapot and the single cup on the table in Image B suggests a setting for tea, but it does not strongly imply a conversation scene. A conversation scene would typically involve items or placements indicating interaction between two people—such as two cups, perhaps facing each other, or signs of recent use like steam or open books. Here, only one cup is present, which may suggest a solitary moment rather than a shared experience. Additionally, the chairs remain unoccupied, and there are no other contextual clues (e.g., books, notes, or gestures) that indicate dialogue. While the setup is cozy and inviting, the lack of symmetry or multiple cups reduces the implication of a conversation. Therefore, the scene leans more toward solitude or preparation than active exchange.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the overall layout of the room—including the two armchairs, the rug, the window, curtains, and the potted plant—remains consistent. The furniture positions have not shifted; both chairs are symmetrically placed around the central table, and the large green plant is still in the corner. The window framing, curtain drapes, and wall colors are identical. Even the smaller decorative elements like the small potted plant on the windowsill and the stack of books remain in place. The only notable change is the replacement of the vase with a teapot and cup on the table. Since all other elements are spatially preserved, the background and furniture positions have indeed remained unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teapot and porcelain cup in Image B are well-integrated into the room’s lighting and environment. The natural daylight coming through the window illuminates the objects evenly, highlighting their glossy surfaces without causing unnatural glare or shadows. The soft, diffused light complements the delicate blue-and-white pattern typical of porcelain, enhancing its visual appeal. Furthermore, the reflective quality of the porcelain aligns with how such materials behave under indoor daylight. The placement on the small round table also ensures they are within the ambient light zone, consistent with realistic interior lighting behavior. There are no visual inconsistencies such as mismatched reflections, harsh highlights, or incorrect shadow directions. Therefore, the teapot and cup appear to harmonize naturally with the room’s lighting and aesthetic.",
