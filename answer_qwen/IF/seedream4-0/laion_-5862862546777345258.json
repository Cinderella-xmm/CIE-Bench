      "question": "Is the entire church and square scene enclosed within a visible baroque-styled dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly contained within a transparent dome that sits atop an ornate base. The dome itself is not made of glass but appears to be part of a decorative structure with elaborate scrollwork and gilded detailing along its edges—characteristic of Baroque design. The curvature of the dome and the ornamental flourishes on its frame align with Baroque aesthetics, which emphasize grandeur, movement, and intricate ornamentation. The presence of this dome encasing the entire miniature scene confirms that it is indeed enclosed within a visible Baroque-styled dome. This contrasts with real-world architecture where such domes are not typically present over public squares.",

      "question": "Is the church depicted with a glossy, white or off-white porcelain-like surface featuring intricate painted or molded details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The church in Image B has a smooth, reflective surface that mimics porcelain or fine ceramic material. Its color is predominantly white with subtle beige tones, consistent with glazed porcelain. The architectural elements—such as the columns, arches, and decorative motifs—are sharply defined and appear either molded into the surface or finely painted, giving them a delicate, handcrafted appearance. These features are typical of high-quality porcelain miniatures often used in collectible dioramas. The surface reflects light uniformly, suggesting a polished finish, reinforcing the impression of porcelain craftsmanship.",

      "question": "Are all human figures in the scene replaced with small, metallic gray pewter-like figures with detailed features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the human figures are uniformly rendered in a monochromatic silver-gray tone, resembling metal such as pewter. They possess distinct postures and clothing folds, indicating attention to detail despite their small size. Unlike the natural skin tones and varied clothing colors seen in real-life scenes (as would be expected in Image A), these figures lack realistic color variation and instead have a uniform metallic sheen. Their stylized yet discernible features—such as heads, limbs, and garments—suggest they are crafted from a solid material like cast metal, commonly used in miniature figurines. This transformation from living people to static, metallic representations is consistent across all individuals in the scene.",

      "question": "Is the entire diorama placed upon a visible base made of textured, veined, or aged-looking marble?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base supporting the dome in Image B exhibits a patterned surface with swirling veins of gray and brown through a creamy white background, characteristic of natural marble. The texture appears slightly rough and irregular, suggesting age or intentional antiquing. Additionally, the base is adorned with gold-leafed Baroque-style carvings, including scrolls and floral motifs, which enhance its opulent appearance. This combination of marbled texture and ornate detailing strongly indicates that the diorama rests on a purposefully designed marble-like pedestal, likely intended to evoke classical elegance.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the café tables in the scene rendered as small, transparent, or reflective glass objects with delicate structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The café tables in Image B are depicted as simple, flat rectangular surfaces without transparency or reflectivity. They appear to be made of a matte material, possibly wood or plastic, and do not exhibit any signs of being glass or crystal. While some parts of the scene—like the tree—are transparent, the tables themselves lack refractive qualities or internal structures typical of glass. In contrast, real-world café tables (as seen in Image A) might be wooden or metal, but here they are simplified and non-reflective. Therefore, they are not rendered as transparent or reflective glass objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the trees in the scene made of transparent or translucent glass with visible internal details or refractive qualities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree located on the left side of the diorama in Image B is composed of clear, crystalline material that allows light to pass through it, creating a sparkling effect. Its branches and leaves are formed from interconnected glass elements, giving it a faceted, gem-like appearance. Light interacts with the structure, producing refraction and internal reflections, which are hallmarks of glass or crystal artistry. This is distinctly different from a real tree (as in Image A), which would have green foliage and organic textures. The artificial nature and optical properties confirm that the tree is made of transparent or translucent glass with visible internal details.",

      "question": "Does the scene exhibit a cohesive, elegant aesthetic with rich textures and balanced lighting that conveys a sense of vibrancy and timelessness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a highly curated and artistically refined diorama. The combination of materials—porcelain-like building, metallic figures, glass tree, and marble base—creates a harmonious blend of textures and finishes. The lighting is soft and evenly distributed, highlighting the reflective surfaces without harsh shadows, contributing to a serene and timeless atmosphere. The Baroque styling of the dome and base adds grandeur, while the meticulous craftsmanship enhances the sense of elegance. Despite the absence of motion or natural variation, the scene feels vibrant due to its intricate details and visual richness. Overall, the composition achieves a balance between realism and artistic abstraction, evoking both historical charm and enduring beauty.",
