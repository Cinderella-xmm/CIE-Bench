      "question": "Does the edited image depict the camera with intricate gears and mechanical components characteristic of steampunk design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a camera that has been stylized to include numerous mechanical elements such as exposed gears, pipes, and brass-like fittings. These components are not present in standard modern cameras but are hallmark features of steampunk aesthetics, which blend Victorian-era industrial design with fantastical machinery. The presence of large, detailed gears on the side of the camera body and within the lens assembly strongly suggests an intentional steampunk transformation. This is consistent with the genreâ€™s emphasis on visible mechanics and retro-futuristic engineering.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the camera and tripod in the edited image rendered with a metallic finish resembling brass, iron, or similar materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in the edited image indicate that the camera and tripod have been rendered with a rich, metallic texture. The coloration is predominantly coppery-brown with golden highlights, typical of aged brass or bronze. The sheen and reflective qualities suggest polished metal surfaces, while darker areas imply depth and material thickness. These characteristics align with common representations of metals like brass and iron in steampunk art, where such finishes are used to evoke an industrial, vintage feel.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image include visible rivets, bolts, or pipe-like structures as part of the camera and tripod design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection, the edited image reveals multiple structural details consistent with industrial design. There are clearly visible rivets along the edges of the camera body and tripod legs, as well as hexagonal bolts securing various components. Additionally, curved pipe-like structures connect parts of the camera and tripod, especially noticeable on the right side of the camera body and extending down into the tripod head. These elements are not found on real-world digital cameras but are typical in steampunk designs, where functional-looking hardware is exaggerated for aesthetic effect.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting in the edited image emphasize the metallic textures through strong contrasts and reflections, enhancing the three-dimensional appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in the edited image is carefully designed to highlight the metallic surfaces. Bright highlights appear on curved edges and convex surfaces, such as the gears and lens barrel, suggesting directional light sources. Shadows are cast in recessed areas, creating depth and volume. Reflections are visible on polished parts, indicating a glossy surface finish. This interplay of light and shadow enhances the perception of three-dimensionality and emphasizes the texture of the metal, which is a common technique in digital rendering to simulate realistic materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image incorporate signs of aging or weathering, such as rust or scratches, on the metallic surfaces of the camera and tripod?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfaces of both the camera and tripod exhibit subtle signs of wear and tear. There are darkened patches, pitting, and discolorations that resemble rust or oxidation, particularly around the joints and edges. These imperfections contribute to a sense of age and use, reinforcing the steampunk theme, which often includes worn, vintage machinery. Such weathering effects are intentionally applied in digital art to give objects a lived-in, historical quality, distinguishing them from pristine, modern equipment.",
