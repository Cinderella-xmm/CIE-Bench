      "question": "Is the dog depicted as a plush stuffed animal with soft, fabric-like texture and visible seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is clearly a plush toy, not a real animal. The surface exhibits a soft, fabric-like texture typical of stuffed animals, with visible stitching along the edges of the limbs and facial features. The material appears to be a plush or velvety fabric, common in toys. Additionally, the seams around the ears, limbs, and body are noticeable, which is characteristic of sewn plush items. This contrasts with real fur, which would have a more natural, less uniform texture without such defined stitching. Therefore, based on visual cues like texture and seams, it is evident that this is a plush toy.",

      "question": "Does the plush dog retain white fur with sandy-colored spots in the same pattern as the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush dog has a predominantly white body with light brown or sandy-colored patches on its ears, paws, and face. These spots are consistent in color and placement with the original dog in Image A, particularly around the ears and lower limbs. However, the pattern of these spots is stylized and simplified due to the nature of the plush design—realistic patterns may not translate directly into a toy's design. Nevertheless, the overall distribution and coloration match the original, suggesting an intentional replication of the dog’s appearance. Thus, while not identical in detail, the pattern is preserved in a way that aligns with the original.",

      "question": "Has the harness been replaced with a corset featuring visible crystal-like embellishments that create a sparkling effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the harness worn by the plush dog is distinctly different from the one in Image A. Instead of a floral-patterned fabric harness, this version features a structured, V-shaped corset-style accessory made of shiny, reflective material. It is adorned with numerous clear, faceted elements resembling crystals or rhinestones, which catch the light and produce a sparkling effect. This is a significant transformation from the original harness, indicating a deliberate stylistic change. The design suggests a fashion-forward or decorative purpose, likely intended to enhance the toy’s aesthetic appeal.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plush dog in Image B is positioned on a flat, light-colored wooden shelf with a clean, smooth surface. The background is a plain, neutral off-white wall, devoid of any clutter, decorations, or additional objects. This minimalist setup emphasizes the plush toy, drawing attention to its details without visual distractions. The lighting is even and soft, further enhancing the clean presentation. This setting aligns with modern product photography standards, where simplicity highlights the subject. Therefore, the environment is intentionally minimalistic.",

      "question": "Are the paws of the plush dog slightly dangling below the edge of the shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the plush dog is seated on the shelf with its front paws extending slightly over the edge. The toes are visible beneath the shelf, indicating that the paws are indeed hanging down. This positioning gives the toy a relaxed, casual posture, commonly used in display setups to add charm and realism. The slight overhang is subtle but noticeable, contributing to the overall aesthetic of the image. This detail enhances the sense of depth and dimensionality in the composition.",

      "question": "Does the plush dog exhibit a cute demeanor through soft facial features, gentle expression, and overall design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plush dog in Image B has large, rounded eyes (though partially obscured by sunglasses), a small black nose, and a stitched smile that conveys a friendly, approachable expression. The soft, fluffy texture of the fur, combined with the symmetrical and proportionate design, contributes to a universally perceived 'cute' aesthetic. Even with the addition of sunglasses and a flashy corset, the overall design remains playful and endearing. Such characteristics are typical of children’s toys designed to evoke affection and warmth. Therefore, despite the fashionable accessories, the core design maintains a cute and appealing demeanor.",
