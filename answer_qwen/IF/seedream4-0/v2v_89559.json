      "question": "Have the 'Search for a Star' and 'Rising Star' logos been transformed into stylized, gleaming golden award statuettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Search for a Star' logo is not present at all; instead, a golden Oscar-style statuette appears on the left side of the image. This suggests that the 'Search for a Star' logo has been replaced by a generic award figure, which may be interpreted as a symbolic representation of recognition or achievement. However, the 'Rising Star' logo has been reimagined in a more elaborate form: it now appears atop a wooden pedestal with a metallic sheen and a golden star, resembling an award trophy. While it retains its original design elements (like the star and text), it has been stylized to look like a gleaming golden award statuette. Therefore, only the 'Rising Star' logo has been transformed into a stylized award statuette, while the 'Search for a Star' logo has been entirely replaced by a different icon. Based on this analysis, the answer is no — both logos have not been transformed as described.",

      "question": "Has the background been changed to a rich, dark velvet curtain, replacing the original green background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a deep black, textured backdrop that exhibits soft folds and subtle highlights consistent with a draped fabric, such as velvet. The lighting emphasizes the material's depth and richness, creating a dramatic and formal atmosphere typical of award ceremonies. In contrast, Image A has a solid, bright green background with no texture or depth. The transition from a flat green color to a luxurious, dark curtain indicates a deliberate stylistic change aimed at enhancing the prestige and ceremonial feel of the image. Given the visual cues and common associations with award presentations, it is reasonable to conclude that the background has indeed been changed to resemble a rich, dark velvet curtain.",

      "question": "Is the 'Sumo Digital' logo rendered as an embossed seal on a polished wooden plaque beneath the 'Rising Star' logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Rising Star' logo is mounted on a wooden base that resembles a trophy pedestal. On the right side of this base, there is a circular emblem with the word 'Sumo' inscribed within it, surrounded by a decorative border. This emblem closely resembles an embossed seal or medallion, and it is affixed to the polished wooden surface, giving it the appearance of being stamped or engraved into the wood. The overall presentation mimics a formal seal of approval or branding commonly seen on official awards. Comparing this to Image A, where the 'Sumo Digital' logo appears as a flat graphic element, Image B elevates it into a three-dimensional, tactile object. Thus, the transformation aligns with the description of an embossed seal on a wooden plaque.",

      "question": "Is the 'Character Art Directory 2018' text presented in elegant, engraved silver lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Character Art Directory 2018' in Image B is rendered in a metallic silver font with a beveled edge and subtle shading, giving it a three-dimensional, engraved appearance. The letters reflect light as if made of polished metal, and their placement over the dark background enhances their prominence. This style is consistent with engraved or chiseled lettering often used on plaques or trophies. In contrast, Image A displays the same text in plain white sans-serif font against a green background, lacking any metallic or engraved qualities. The change in typography and material effect clearly indicates that the text has been redesigned to appear as elegant, engraved silver lettering.",

      "question": "Has the structural integrity of the original image been maintained while applying the specified changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The structural integrity of the original image refers to whether the core components—such as the logos, text, and overall layout—are preserved in a coherent and recognizable way despite visual modifications. In Image B, the 'Rising Star' logo remains central and identifiable, though stylized into a trophy format. The 'Sumo Digital' branding is still present, albeit repositioned and re-rendered as a seal. The 'Character Art Directory 2018' text is retained but transformed in style. The 'Search for a Star' logo has been replaced entirely by a golden statuette, which deviates significantly from the original composition. While most key elements are preserved in spirit and placement, the substitution of one major logo with a completely different symbol alters the original structure. Therefore, although the overall theme and purpose remain intact, the structural integrity is compromised due to the removal and replacement of a significant component.",
