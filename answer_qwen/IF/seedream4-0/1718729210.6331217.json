      "question": "Is the scarecrow presented within a box-like packaging structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the scarecrow is clearly resting on a rectangular cardboard box. The box has visible edges and flaps, typical of packaging, and features Halloween-themed illustrations such as jack-o'-lantern faces. This suggests it is not just a random platform but a purpose-built container, likely for display or storage. Given that the scarecrow's feet are positioned inside the box and the structure appears to be supporting it, this indicates the scarecrow is indeed presented within a box-like packaging structure. The presence of such packaging aligns with common commercial presentation of decorative items, especially seasonal ones like Halloween decorations.",

      "question": "Does the background feature a nighttime farm scene with a dark sky, stars, and a field under moonlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B shows a night sky filled with stars and a bright celestial body resembling the moon, casting soft illumination across the landscape. Below, there is an expansive field of harvested crops, consistent with a farmland setting. In the distance, mountain silhouettes and faint outlines of farm structures (such as a red barn) are visible, reinforcing the rural, agricultural context. These visual elements—dark sky, stars, moonlight, and open fields—are characteristic of a nighttime farm scene. Therefore, the background matches the description provided in the question.",

      "question": "Has the scarecrow's body been replaced with glossy, weather-resistant materials instead of natural straw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the scarecrow in Image B, its torso and limbs appear to have a shiny, reflective surface, unlike the rough, fibrous texture of natural straw. This glossiness suggests the use of synthetic or coated materials, possibly plastic or vinyl, which are commonly used in weather-resistant outdoor decor. Additionally, the material seems to resist wear and tear, indicating it is designed for durability in outdoor conditions. This contrasts with traditional scarecrows made entirely of natural materials like hay and cloth. Thus, the body has been replaced with glossy, weather-resistant materials.",

      "question": "Is the scarecrow's hat designed with a visible cavity or opening suitable for holding a candle, indicating it is a detachable candle holder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the scarecrow’s head in Image B features a lantern-like structure with a glowing candle inside. The hat itself is shaped like a classic conical design but includes a transparent dome over the candle, suggesting it functions as a protective cover. There is no visible cavity beneath the candle; instead, the candle is encased in a glass lantern attached directly to the hat. While the hat may be removable, the primary function appears to be lighting rather than being a standalone candle holder. However, the presence of a defined space around the candle and the structural design imply that the hat could serve as a detachable candle holder. Based on the visual cues, the hat does include a cavity suitable for a candle, and its construction supports the idea of detachment for maintenance or replacement.",

      "question": "Are LED string lights visibly present in the image, either on or near the scarecrow or packaging, emitting a soft glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a series of small, warm-colored lights are strung across the scarecrow’s arms and torso, forming a continuous loop. These lights emit a soft, golden glow and are consistent in appearance with LED string lights commonly used in festive or decorative displays. They are wrapped around the scarecrow’s body and extend down to the base, where they also illuminate the surrounding area. The even spacing and brightness suggest modern lighting technology rather than traditional bulbs. Furthermore, the light pattern is uniform and consistent with LED strands used in holiday decorations. Therefore, LED string lights are clearly visible and active in the image.",

      "question": "Is there a decorative crow figurine placed on top of the box packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the very top of the scarecrow’s head, there is a black bird perched on the lantern structure. This bird resembles a crow or raven and is positioned directly above the candle. However, it is not on the box packaging—it is on the scarecrow’s hat. The box is located below the scarecrow’s legs, while the bird is at the highest point of the figure. Although the bird is decorative and fits the Halloween theme, it is not placed on the box itself. Therefore, despite its presence, it does not meet the criterion of being 'on top of the box packaging.'",
