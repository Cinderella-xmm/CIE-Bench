      "question": "Is the tall ice tower in the foreground rendered with pixelated textures and visible circuit-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall ice tower on the right is clearly not a realistic representation of ice. Instead, it is composed of blocky, pixelated cubes that resemble digital or voxel-based construction, similar to styles seen in games like Minecraft. Additionally, glowing blue lines resembling electronic circuitry are embedded within its structure, forming intricate pathways that mimic computer circuit boards. This visual style strongly suggests a digital or cybernetic aesthetic rather than natural ice. These features—pixelation and circuit patterns—are consistent across the entire surface of the tower, indicating intentional stylization toward a futuristic, digital theme. Based on this analysis, the answer is clearly affirmative.",

      "question": "Is the Sydney Opera House represented using glowing neon lines instead of solid surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sydney Opera House is depicted with bright, luminous outlines in vivid colors such as cyan, pink, and purple. These lines trace the iconic shell-like structures of the building, but they do not fill in the surfaces with solid material. Instead, the interior areas appear dark or transparent, emphasizing the outline effect. This stylistic choice resembles neon signage or digital wireframes commonly used in retro-futuristic or cyberpunk aesthetics. The absence of solid surfaces and the dominance of glowing edges confirm that the Opera House is rendered using neon lines rather than traditional architectural rendering. Therefore, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Are the waves in the ocean composed of geometric shapes rather than realistic water ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ocean in Image B does not display natural water ripples or fluid motion. Instead, the surface is overlaid with sharp, angular patterns formed by intersecting lines and triangular shapes, all illuminated with bright cyan light. These patterns resemble digital grids or abstract geometric designs, reminiscent of augmented reality overlays or digital landscapes. The lack of realistic wave behavior and the presence of structured, repeating forms indicate that the ocean has been stylized into a geometric, digital representation. This contrasts sharply with real-world water dynamics, confirming that the waves are indeed composed of geometric shapes.",

      "question": "Does the drink on the left appear as a transparent, floating hologram with visible depth and light distortion effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drink on the left in Image B retains a physical appearance similar to a real cocktail, complete with ice cubes, liquid coloration, and a straw. While there is some pixelation and slight digital artifacting around the edges, especially near the glass rim and ice, it is not rendered as a translucent, floating hologram. There is no evidence of depth distortion, refraction effects, or ethereal glow typical of holographic projections. The drink remains grounded on the surface and appears solid, despite minor digital stylization. Thus, it does not meet the criteria of being a hologram with light distortion effects.",

      "question": "Does the entire scene exhibit a unified futuristic digital aesthetic, with all elements (ice tower, Opera House, ocean, drink) transformed according to their specified styles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cohesive futuristic digital theme. The Sydney Opera House is outlined in neon, the ocean features geometric, glowing patterns, and the ice tower is constructed from pixelated blocks with circuitry. Even the drink shows subtle digital artifacts, aligning with the overall aesthetic. However, the drink on the left, while slightly stylized, lacks the full transformation seen in other elements—it does not fully adopt the pixelated or holographic qualities of the rest of the scene. Despite this minor inconsistency, the majority of the elements are uniformly transformed into a digital, cyberpunk-inspired style. Given that most components adhere to the same thematic language and only one element deviates slightly, the overall scene can still be considered unified in its futuristic digital aesthetic.",
