      "question": "Is the statue rendered with a matte, textured surface resembling molded clay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the surface of the statue appears to have a non-reflective, slightly uneven texture that is consistent with molded clay or terracotta. The coloration is earthy and uniform, lacking the polished sheen typical of stone or metal sculptures. This texture is further supported by subtle variations in tone and surface detail, such as minor indentations and soft edges, which are characteristic of hand-molded materials. These visual cues, combined with common knowledge about traditional religious statuary made from clay, suggest that the material representation aligns with molded clay.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the statue enclosed within a large circular glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is clearly surrounded by a transparent, spherical structure that resembles a glass dome. The curvature of the dome is evident from the way light reflects and refracts across its surface, and the presence of internal lighting fixtures confirms it is a sealed enclosure. The dome’s size is substantial enough to fully encase the statue, which is consistent with a display case or protective housing. This observation aligns with common practices of preserving or showcasing sacred artifacts under domes, especially in ceremonial or museum-like contexts.",

      "question": "Is the glass dome resting on a decorative pedestal with ornamental design elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the glass dome in Image B features a richly detailed pedestal with intricate carvings and symmetrical patterns. The design includes floral motifs, scrollwork, and layered architectural elements, all indicative of traditional craftsmanship. The pedestal is not plain but elaborately decorated, serving both a functional and aesthetic purpose. This matches known styles of religious or cultural display bases, where ornamentation enhances spiritual significance and visual appeal.",

      "question": "Are there visible ornate patterns on the glass dome, including lotus and wave motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the surface of the glass dome in Image B, decorative etchings or engravings are visible. Among these, stylized lotus flowers can be seen—symbolic in many Eastern traditions, particularly Hinduism—alongside wavy lines that resemble ocean waves. These patterns are artistically integrated into the dome's surface, enhancing its visual richness. The use of lotus and wave motifs is culturally significant, often representing purity and the cycle of life, respectively. Their presence here suggests intentional symbolic decoration.",

      "question": "Are the trident, snake, and drum illuminated by spotlights that emphasize their golden color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the glass dome, multiple spotlights are positioned above the statue, casting focused beams of light downward. These lights highlight specific elements of the statue, particularly the trident, the coiled snake around the neck, and the drum held in one hand. The illumination accentuates the golden hue of these objects, making them stand out against the more subdued tones of the rest of the statue. This selective lighting technique is commonly used to draw attention to sacred symbols, reinforcing their importance.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the muscular contours of the statue emphasized with detailed and intricate shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue in Image B displays well-defined musculature, especially in the arms, chest, and legs. The interplay of light and shadow, created by the internal spotlights, enhances these contours, giving depth and dimensionality to the figure. Shadows fall precisely along anatomical lines, suggesting careful sculptural modeling and deliberate lighting to accentuate physical form. This technique is often used in classical and religious sculpture to convey strength and divinity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the base of the pedestal in Image B, several small, bowl-shaped containers are arranged symmetrically. Each contains upright incense sticks, indicating they are incense burners. These are typical offerings in religious settings, especially in Hindu worship. Their placement around the pedestal reinforces the sacred context of the statue, suggesting ritual use. The presence of such items is consistent with devotional practices associated with deities like Shiva.",
