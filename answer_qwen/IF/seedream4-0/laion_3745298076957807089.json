      "question": "Has the black bottle cap been replaced with a transparent or translucent glass stopper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the bottle features a clear, transparent glass stopper that is cylindrical in shape and allows visibility into the neck of the bottle. This contrasts sharply with the original black plastic or rubber cap seen in typical whisky bottles. The glass stopper appears to be designed for aesthetic appeal and functionality, consistent with fragrance diffusers. Based on visual cues, the stopper is not opaque or dark but rather transparent, indicating a significant change from the original design. This conclusion is supported by common knowledge about reed diffusers, which often use glass stoppers to allow reeds to extend into the liquid.",

      "question": "Are thin, dark-colored reeds visible protruding from the top of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several thin, dark-colored sticks are clearly visible extending vertically from the top of the bottle through the glass stopper. These reeds are characteristic of reed diffusers, where they absorb and disperse fragrance into the air. Their presence is unmistakable due to their uniform thickness, dark color (likely black or deep brown), and arrangement in a fan-like pattern. This aligns with standard design practices for fragrance diffusers, confirming their identity as reeds.",

      "question": "Does the label display an art deco design with geometric patterns, symmetrical elements, or stylized fonts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label in Image B features a highly decorative design with strong vertical lines, symmetrical floral motifs, and ornate borders. While it includes some geometric framing and symmetry—hallmarks of Art Deco—it also incorporates naturalistic botanical illustrations. However, the dominant style leans more toward a vintage botanical illustration with a green background and gold detailing, rather than a purely Art Deco aesthetic, which typically emphasizes bold geometric shapes, zigzags, and streamlined forms. Therefore, while there are elements of symmetry and stylization, the overall design is best described as botanical-artistic rather than strictly Art Deco.",

      "question": "Is the label predominantly colored in emerald green and gold, replacing the original color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label is clearly dominated by a deep emerald green background with intricate gold detailing, including floral patterns and border designs. This is a stark contrast to the original label in Image A, which featured a golden-yellow hue with black text and branding. The shift from a warm amber-gold tone to a rich green-and-gold palette indicates a deliberate redesign, likely to evoke a sense of luxury and nature, fitting for a fragrance product. Thus, the new color scheme has indeed replaced the original one.",

      "question": "Are floral or botanical illustrations (such as flowers, leaves, or plants) present on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label in Image B prominently displays detailed illustrations of various flowers and plants, including yellow blossoms, red buds, white blooms, and leafy stems, all rendered in a stylized yet realistic manner. These botanical elements are central to the design and occupy most of the label's surface area. Such imagery is commonly used in luxury fragrances to suggest natural ingredients or garden-inspired scents. Given the clarity and prominence of these illustrations, it is evident that floral and botanical motifs are present.",

      "question": "Has the bottle been transformed into a functional-looking luxury fragrance diffuser with all associated components (stopper, reeds, redesigned label)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bottle that has been repurposed from its original function as a whisky container into a fragrance diffuser. Key indicators include the transparent glass stopper, the presence of dark reeds inserted into the liquid, and a redesigned label with botanical artwork and a luxurious green-and-gold color scheme. These components are all standard features of high-end reed diffusers. The transformation maintains the original bottle’s shape but alters its contents, accessories, and labeling to serve a new purpose. This complete conversion suggests a deliberate redesign into a functional and aesthetically pleasing diffuser.",
