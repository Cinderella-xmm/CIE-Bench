    "Question": "Q1: Is the image now structured as a multi-panel infographic with at least three distinct steps?",
    "explanation": "The image is clearly organized into a vertical layout divided into three separate sections, each labeled with a step number (Step 1, Step 2, Step 3). Each section contains both visual illustrations and textual instructions. This format is characteristic of a multi-panel infographic designed to guide viewers through a sequence of actions. The presence of numbered steps and corresponding visuals confirms that it is structured as an instructional infographic with multiple panels.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a panel showing a simple figure in a kneeling position with bent arms pulled back, labeled as 'Step 1: Positioning: Kneel with bent arms back'?",
    "explanation": "In the first panel of the infographic, there is a white silhouette-style figure depicted in a kneeling position. The arms are bent and positioned behind the body, consistent with the description of 'bent arms back'. The accompanying text explicitly labels this as 'Step 1: Positioning: Kneel with bent arms back', confirming both the visual and textual alignment with the question. The use of a simplified figure emphasizes the posture without distraction, which is typical in instructional diagrams.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a panel showing an explosive leaping motion with visual cues of propulsion (e.g., motion lines, energy burst), labeled as 'Step 2: Leap Attack: Propel using core strength'?",
    "explanation": "The second panel features an illustrated character in mid-leap, with dynamic motion lines radiating from the body to suggest rapid movement and force. These lines are commonly used in anime and comic art to indicate speed or power, serving as visual cues for propulsion. The character's pose — legs extended forward and arms back — supports the idea of a powerful leap. The label 'Step 2: Leap Attack: Propel using core strength' matches the described action, reinforcing the intended interpretation of the scene as a forceful jump powered by core strength.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a panel showing the figure mid-air with knees tucked tightly, labeled as 'Step 3: Mid-Air Adjustment: Tuck knees tightly'?",
    "explanation": "The third panel displays the character in a seated, crouched position in mid-air, with knees drawn up close to the chest, indicating a tucked posture. This aligns directly with the instruction 'Tuck knees tightly'. The figure is also shown on a stand, simulating suspension in air, which supports the 'mid-air' context. The caption reads 'Step 3: Mid-Air Adjustment: Tuck knees tightly', matching both the visual and textual elements of the question. This configuration is consistent with techniques used in acrobatics or martial arts to stabilize during aerial maneuvers.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the illustrations rendered with bold outlines, vibrant blues and whites as dominant colors, and captions written in energetic, stylized fonts?",
    "explanation": "The entire image uses a high-contrast design with thick, black-outlined figures and clean, sharp edges, which is typical of anime-inspired artwork. The color scheme prominently features bright blue (in the character’s outfit and background) and white (for highlights and text), creating a visually striking palette. The font used for the title 'Master the Power Jump' and the step labels is bold, stylized, and slightly italicized, giving it an energetic, dynamic feel appropriate for action-oriented content. These stylistic choices are consistent with manga and anime aesthetics, enhancing the sense of motion and excitement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
