      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top door shelf of the refrigerator displays a label with the text 'Xu's Fresh Zone' in colorful, stylized font. This is clearly visible and positioned on the door’s uppermost shelf, which is typically used for branding or decorative labels. Based on visual inspection, this label appears to be a custom addition rather than an original manufacturer's logo. The rest of the refrigerator does not show any other prominent branding, suggesting that the original brand logo has been replaced or obscured by this new label. Given that 'Xu's Fresh Zone' is not a known appliance brand and its placement is consistent with personalized branding, it can be inferred that the original brand logo has been altered or replaced.",

      "question": "Is there a custom label with the user’s name added on the top shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the top shelf of the refrigerator in Image B, there is a white rectangular label with the text 'User's Name' printed on it. This label is positioned centrally on the upper edge of the fridge interior, just below the top frame. The text is generic and appears to be a placeholder, suggesting it is intended to be customized with a real name. This indicates that a custom label has indeed been added, although the specific name is not yet filled in. The presence of such a label implies personalization, aligning with the concept of a user-specific identifier. Therefore, based on the visual evidence, a custom label with the user’s name (or placeholder) is present.",

      "question": "Have any additional parts of the refrigerator's design or logo been altered besides changing the brand logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, aside from the addition of the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' label on the door shelf and the 'User's Name' label on the top shelf, no other structural or design elements of the refrigerator appear to have been modified. The overall shape, color, shelving layout, and internal components (such as crisper drawers, door bins, and lighting) remain consistent with standard refrigerator designs. There are no visible changes to the exterior panels, handles, or control interface. The only alterations are the textual labels, which are superficial additions rather than modifications to the physical design. Thus, no additional design or structural changes beyond the labeling are evident.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Xu's Fresh Zone' is displayed on the upper door shelf of the refrigerator in Image B. It is written in a bold, colorful font with green, red, and yellow letters, making it highly visible against the white background of the shelf. The letters are well-spaced and large enough to be easily read from a normal viewing distance. There is no blurring, distortion, or overlapping with other objects, ensuring clarity. Given these visual characteristics, the text is both clear and legible, fulfilling the purpose of a branded or personalized label.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label reading 'User's Name' is located on the top shelf of the refrigerator, specifically on the upper interior edge, just beneath the top frame. This placement is consistent with a custom label being affixed to a prominent but non-intrusive location. No other labels with similar content are visible elsewhere in the refrigerator. While other items like bottles and containers are present, none bear a name or personalized text. Therefore, the custom label is placed solely on the top shelf, and there is no indication of it appearing anywhere else in the appliance. This confirms exclusivity of placement.",
