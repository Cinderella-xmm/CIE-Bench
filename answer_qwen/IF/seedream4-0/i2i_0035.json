      "question": "Does the edited image contain the exact title “Today’s Balanced Lunch” at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the image clearly displays the text 'Today’s Balanced Lunch' in a bold, white font against an orange background. This text is positioned prominently at the top center of the image, above the plate. The font style and placement are consistent with typical design choices for titles in promotional or educational materials. Based on visual inspection, the exact phrase matches the one in the question. No other variations or misspellings are present.",

      "question": "Is there a placeholder for the school logo located at the bottom right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom right corner contains a small graphic of a cartoon cow wearing a hat, which appears to be a logo. Below it, the text 'Toogy's Balanced Lunch' and 'Fortress Hill/Loganah Schools' is visible. This suggests that the cow graphic is likely the school's logo or branding element. Given that this logo is integrated into the design and placed in a standard location for institutional branding (bottom right), it functions as a logo placeholder. The presence of the school name further supports that this is a designated space for the school's identity.",

      "question": "Have the colors in the food and background been visibly enhanced to appear more vivid and bright?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the two images, Image B exhibits noticeably brighter and more saturated colors than Image A. The orange background is more intense, the green of the lettuce appears more vibrant, the red of the sauce on the sandwich is richer, and the orange slices have a more luminous hue. Additionally, the white plate contrasts more sharply against the background. These enhancements suggest post-processing to increase color saturation and brightness, commonly done in promotional or educational imagery to make food look more appealing. Such enhancement aligns with common practices in school meal marketing to encourage healthy eating.",

      "question": "Are white outlines visible around the edges of all items on the plate in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, there are no distinct white outlines around the individual food items such as the salad, orange slices, sandwich, or milk carton. While the entire plate is framed by a dashed white border, this does not extend to the edges of the food items themselves. In contrast, some digital editing techniques might add such outlines for emphasis, but in this case, the food items blend naturally into the plate without any artificial outlining. Therefore, no such white outlines are present on the food.",

      "question": "Has the image been formatted to fit an A4 vertical layout, ensuring proper alignment of text and imagery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a vertical orientation with a clear top-to-bottom flow: a title at the top, the main image centered in the middle, and branding/logo elements at the bottom. The layout includes balanced spacing, with text aligned properly and the central image proportionally scaled. The dimensions and arrangement suggest it is designed for a printed or digital document format like A4, where vertical layouts are standard for flyers or informational sheets. The inclusion of page numbering ('4') in the bottom left corner further indicates formatting for a multi-page document, typical of A4 layouts used in schools or publications. Thus, the image appears professionally formatted for such a purpose.",
