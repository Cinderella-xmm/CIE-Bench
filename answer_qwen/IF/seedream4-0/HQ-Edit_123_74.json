      "question": "Has the snowboarder's helmet been enlarged proportionally compared to their head and body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder’s helmet appears consistent in scale with the proportions of their head and body. The helmet fits naturally on the head, maintaining a realistic ratio relative to facial features and overall body size. There is no visual distortion or exaggeration that would suggest an unnatural enlargement. The design of the helmet follows typical proportions seen in real-world ski or snowboarding gear, where helmets are designed to cover the head without appearing oversized. The surrounding elements—such as the backpack and gloves—are also proportionally balanced, reinforcing the sense of accurate scaling. No evidence suggests the helmet has been disproportionately enlarged.",

      "question": "Have the snowboarder's hands been visibly enlarged compared to their arms and body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the snowboarder’s hands appear proportionate to their arms and body. The gloves are sized appropriately for the hand structure, and there is no indication of exaggerated or disproportionate enlargement. In artistic representations, especially stylized ones like this paper-cut aesthetic, limbs may be slightly altered for visual impact, but here the hands maintain natural proportions relative to the rest of the figure. The fingers are clearly defined and align with expected anatomical scaling. This consistency supports the conclusion that the hands have not been enlarged.",

      "question": "Are the red elements of the snowboarder’s outfit vivid and highly saturated, contrasting sharply with the deep blue tones of the snowy environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the red elements of the snowboarder’s outfit—specifically the jacket and pants—are rendered with high saturation and vibrancy. They stand out prominently against the predominantly cool-toned background, which consists of deep blues and whites representing snow and pine trees. This strong chromatic contrast is a deliberate design choice, common in visual art to draw attention to the subject. The red color is not muted or desaturated; instead, it appears bold and eye-catching, enhancing the dynamic feel of the image. This use of complementary colors (red vs. blue) is a well-known principle in visual composition to create emphasis and depth.",

      "question": "Do the snowdrifts and pine trees exhibit a paper-cut style with clean, angular edges and layered textures resembling cut paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the snowdrifts and pine trees in Image B clearly demonstrate a paper-cut art style. The edges of the snowbanks and tree silhouettes are sharp, geometric, and angular, mimicking the appearance of folded or layered paper. The layering effect creates depth, with multiple tiers of blue and white forming the mountains and forest. Additionally, the texture of the trees and snow is simplified into flat planes with clean lines, characteristic of paper art. This stylistic choice is further emphasized by the way light and shadow are represented through overlapping layers rather than smooth gradients. The overall aesthetic strongly resembles traditional or modern paper sculpture techniques.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are multiple snowboarding poses or trick variations visible or indicated in the image as interchangeable action presets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "No, the image depicts only one snowboarding pose—a dynamic, forward-leaning stance during descent. There are no additional poses, alternative stances, or visual indicators such as motion trails, overlays, or icons suggesting interchangeable action presets. The scene focuses entirely on a single moment in time, capturing the snowboarder mid-turn. While the posture is athletic and expressive, it does not imply multiple actions or options. The artistic style emphasizes stillness and composition rather than movement variety or interactive elements.",

      "question": "Is the image presented within a matte-finish collector's album layout that includes bold typography and winter sports-related decorative motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Yes, the image is framed within what appears to be a collector’s album or book cover. The left spine shows a dark blue binding with vertical red text reading 'NOKANEBANEATH' and 'BACKCOUNTRY,' indicating branding or title information. The surface has a matte finish, lacking any glossy reflections. Decorative elements such as snowflake cutouts, layered paper textures, and stylized mountain silhouettes reinforce a winter sports theme. The typography is bold and prominent, especially on the spine and snowboard, contributing to a curated, collectible aesthetic. These features collectively suggest a purposefully designed collector’s item layout.",
