      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays a stylized, cartoonish rendition of a bedroom scene with exaggerated softness and simplified forms. The central pillow has a cute face with rosy cheeks and a gentle smile, which is a hallmark of kawaii (cute) aesthetics commonly seen in Japanese pop culture. Additionally, the overall design is framed with a metallic border, suggesting it is meant to resemble an enamel pin. The use of rounded shapes, pastel-like colors, and playful elements like the smiling pillow aligns with kawaii art style. Combined with the pin-like framing, this strongly indicates that the image is intended to be a kawaii-style enamel pin.",

      "question": "Are there glossy metallic outlines present in the enamel pin design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of all objects—including the bed, lamp, curtains, and frame—are outlined with a thin, reflective golden line. These lines have a shiny, consistent appearance typical of metallic borders used in enamel pins. Enamel pins often feature raised metal outlines that separate colored sections, giving them a polished, three-dimensional look. The visual cues here—uniform thickness, high contrast, and reflective quality—match the characteristics of glossy metallic outlines used in such designs.",

      "question": "Does the enamel pin feature bright and colorful enamel fills?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B includes warm tones such as orange, yellow, beige, and light blue for the window. While not overly vibrant, the colors are saturated and distinct, especially compared to the muted, dimly lit original scene. The background wall is a bright orange, the curtains are a soft teal, and the bedding is a creamy yellow—all applied in solid blocks typical of enamel fillings. This use of bold, flat, and cheerful colors is characteristic of enamel pins designed for visual appeal. Even though the colors are not neon or extremely bright, they are vivid enough to qualify as 'bright and colorful' within the context of enamel art.",

      "question": "Are there any additional elements included in the enamel pin design beyond the bedroom scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The image focuses solely on the bedroom scene: a bed with pillows, a nightstand with a lamp and candles, curtains, a window, and a small framed picture on the wall. There are no extra decorative elements such as text, symbols, or accessories outside the room’s interior. The entire composition is contained within the pin’s border, and everything depicted is part of the bedroom setting. No external motifs, logos, or embellishments are visible beyond the core scene.",

      "question": "Is the enamel pin mockup presented in a square format on a plain white background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the design enclosed within a rounded square frame, which is typical for enamel pin mockups. The background surrounding the pin is uniformly white and devoid of any texture or pattern, indicating a clean, neutral presentation. This is standard practice for product mockups to highlight the item without distraction. The shape is clearly a square with slightly rounded corners, and the placement on a white backdrop confirms it is displayed as a standalone collectible piece.",
