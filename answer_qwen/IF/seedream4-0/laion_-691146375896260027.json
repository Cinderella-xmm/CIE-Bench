      "question": "Is the entire dresser constructed from LEGO bricks, primarily in brown and gold colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show a structure that is clearly made of interlocking plastic bricks, consistent with LEGO construction. The color palette is dominated by shades of brown for the body and golden-yellow for the decorative elements, which aligns with typical LEGO brick colors used to simulate wood and metal finishes. The overall form mimics a classic French-style commode, but every visible surface exhibits the blocky, modular texture characteristic of LEGO bricks. There are no signs of real wood or metal materials; instead, all components appear to be constructed from LEGO pieces. This conclusion is supported by world knowledge about LEGO sets, which often replicate furniture and architectural designs using standardized brick shapes and colors.",

      "question": "Are the decorative patterns on the front of the dresser recreated using small interlocking LEGO pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ornate patterns on the front of the dresser in Image B feature intricate scrollwork and symmetrical designs that closely resemble the brass inlays seen on traditional furniture. These patterns are composed of individual LEGO pieces arranged in precise configurations, forming continuous lines and curves. Given that LEGO allows for detailed modeling through the use of small, specialized pieces such as 1x1 tiles, slopes, and curved bricks, it is plausible that these decorative elements were built using such components. The pixelated yet deliberate nature of the design suggests careful placement of small interlocking bricks to mimic the original's elegance. This aligns with known LEGO techniques for creating detailed artwork and ornamentation.",

      "question": "Are the curved sides and legs of the dresser constructed using smoothly joined sloped LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sides and legs of the dresser exhibit smooth, flowing curves that are characteristic of classic Rococo furniture design. While LEGO bricks are inherently angular, certain types—such as slope bricks, curved slopes, and rounded plates—are specifically designed to create smooth transitions and curves. The curvature of the dresser’s silhouette, particularly along the sides and legs, appears to be achieved through the strategic use of these sloped and curved pieces, which are joined together seamlessly. This technique is common in advanced LEGO builds where realism and fluidity are prioritized. The absence of sharp edges or visible gaps supports the inference that sloped bricks were used to achieve the smooth contours.",

      "question": "Has the marble top been replaced with gray flat LEGO tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top surface of the dresser in Image B is uniformly gray and composed of a grid-like pattern of small, flat LEGO tiles. Unlike the original marble top shown in Image A, which has natural veining and variation in color, this version is solid and lacks any marbled texture. The use of flat LEGO tiles is a common method for simulating stone surfaces in LEGO models due to their uniformity and stability. The consistent texture and color confirm that the original marble has been replaced with LEGO elements, specifically gray flat tiles, to represent a stone-like surface in a simplified, modular form.",

      "question": "Is the dresser placed on a neutral, plain background that does not distract from the LEGO structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the LEGO dresser positioned against a solid, light beige or off-white backdrop. There are no additional objects, textures, or patterns in the background that could draw attention away from the subject. This minimalist setting is typical for product photography, especially when showcasing detailed models like LEGO constructions. The lighting is even and soft, further emphasizing the dresser without introducing shadows or reflections that might obscure details. Therefore, the background serves to highlight the LEGO structure without distraction.",

      "question": "Does the LEGO dresser maintain the original two-drawer layout with ornate frame designs around each drawer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO model in Image B preserves the two-drawer configuration of the original dresser, with a clear horizontal division between the upper and lower sections. Each drawer is framed by elaborate golden outlines that mirror the ornamental brass mounts found on the original piece. These frames include scrolled flourishes and symmetrical detailing, consistent with the Baroque or Rococo style. The alignment and proportion of the drawers match those in the original, indicating a faithful reproduction of the functional and aesthetic layout. The use of LEGO pieces to recreate the frame designs demonstrates an effort to maintain both structural and decorative accuracy.",

      "question": "Are all surfaces of the dresser visibly composed of LEGO bricks, with no realistic wood or metal textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Every visible surface of the dresser in Image B displays the characteristic appearance of LEGO bricks—modular, slightly raised studs, and distinct seams between pieces. There are no applied textures or printed decals that simulate wood grain or metallic finishes; instead, the material properties are entirely derived from the physical shape and color of the bricks themselves. The brown bricks simulate wood, while the gold ones represent metal inlays. Since the image shows no painted or textured surfaces beyond the inherent look of LEGO elements, it can be concluded that all surfaces are made solely of LEGO bricks without added realistic textures.",
