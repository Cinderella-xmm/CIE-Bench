      "question": "Is there a holographic projection screen added to the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a glowing blue translucent interface with a detailed city map and various digital elements is visible above the sandwich. This structure is not present in typical real-world settings and exhibits characteristics of a holographic display—such as floating in mid-air, emitting light, and having a futuristic design. These visual cues strongly suggest that a holographic projection screen has been digitally added to the scene. The presence of this element is inconsistent with normal physical objects and aligns with sci-fi or augmented reality concepts.",

      "question": "Does the holographic projection appear to emerge from the man's phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic projection in Image B is positioned directly above the smartphone held by the man. A faint blue light beam connects the phone to the edge of the holographic screen, suggesting an origin point. In real-world technology, such projections are often depicted as emanating from devices like smartphones in science fiction media. Given the alignment and the visual cue of the light beam, it appears intentional and designed to imply that the projection originates from the phone. This is consistent with common portrayals in movies and tech concept art.",

      "question": "Does the holographic projection screen display a city map interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The content displayed on the holographic screen includes a detailed overhead view of a cityscape with buildings, roads, and grid lines, resembling a digital map. Additionally, surrounding panels show data readouts, graphs, and navigation controls, which are typical features of advanced city mapping interfaces used in futuristic or surveillance-themed applications. Based on these visual elements, the screen clearly displays a city map interface, likely for navigation or monitoring purposes.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the holographic projection screen designed in a futuristic and transparent style characteristic of sci-fi elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic screen features a sleek, transparent layout with glowing blue edges, digital overlays, and interactive panels—all hallmarks of science fiction aesthetics. Its semi-transparent nature allows background elements (like the sandwich and table) to be partially visible through it, which is typical of futuristic holograms in media. The use of neon colors, dynamic UI elements, and floating data boxes further reinforces its sci-fi design. This style is commonly seen in films like 'Minority Report' or 'Iron Man,' where advanced technology is visually represented in such a manner.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the sandwich, knife, paper wrapper, and table surface remain visually identical in composition, lighting, and positioning. The only significant addition is the man and the holographic projection. The sandwich and surrounding environment have not been altered in terms of color, texture, or placement. While the man is new, his inclusion does not distort or alter the original elements. Therefore, aside from the intentional additions (man and hologram), the rest of the image remains consistent with the original, indicating no unintended modifications to the core scene.",
