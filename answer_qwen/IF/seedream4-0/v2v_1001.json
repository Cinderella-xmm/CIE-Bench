      "question": "Is there a ketchup bottle positioned in the lower-right corner of the image, angled slightly toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a red bottle with a white cap is visible in the lower-right corner. The bottle is tilted at an angle, with its opening directed toward the center of the image, from which a stream of red liquid (resembling ketchup) flows upward. The label on the bottle clearly displays 'HEINZ' and features a tomato illustration, consistent with a ketchup bottle. Based on visual cues such as shape, color, branding, and orientation, this object is identifiable as a ketchup bottle. Its placement and angle align with the description provided in the question.",

      "question": "Is the text “The king of flavors” displayed in the middle of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phrase 'The king of flavors' is prominently displayed in the upper-central region of the image, above the dinosaur and slightly below the top edge. While it is centered horizontally, it is not located in the absolute middle of the image but rather in the upper half. However, given the context of visual prominence and spatial positioning, it is reasonable to interpret 'middle' as referring to the central visual area rather than the geometric center. The text is clearly legible and occupies a central position in terms of attention and composition. Therefore, it can be considered displayed in the middle of the image in a compositional sense.",

      "question": "Is the text “The king of flavors” crafted in a glossy, ketchup-style script font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'The king of flavors' in Image B is rendered in a cursive, flowing script font that mimics the appearance of liquid ketchup. It has a shiny, reflective surface with highlights and shadows suggesting a viscous texture. Additionally, droplets appear to be falling from the letters, reinforcing the illusion of ketchup being poured. This stylistic choice directly references the product shown in the ketchup bottle and aligns with common advertising techniques used by Heinz to promote their ketchup as 'the king of flavors.' The combination of the font style, glossiness, and realistic liquid effects confirms that it is indeed crafted in a ketchup-style script font.",

      "question": "Do the letters of “The king of flavors” appear to hover in the air and subtly mingle with the mist of the forest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'The king of flavors' is suspended in mid-air, with no visible support or grounding. It floats above the dinosaur and appears to blend into the surrounding foggy atmosphere. The edges of the letters are slightly diffused, especially where they meet the mist, creating a soft transition between the text and the environment. This visual effect gives the impression that the ketchup-like letters are interacting with the forest mist, enhancing the surreal and artistic quality of the image. The mist itself is dense and ethereal, and the semi-transparent nature of the text’s edges suggests integration with the atmospheric conditions. Thus, the letters do appear to hover and subtly mingle with the mist.",

      "question": "Are there streams of ketchup visually linking back to the opened bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple thin streams of red liquid extend downward from the letters of 'The king of flavors' and connect to the open ketchup bottle in the lower-right corner. These streams follow a natural flow path, suggesting that the text is being 'poured' from the bottle. The continuity of the liquid trail from the bottle to the text reinforces the idea that the words are made of ketchup originating from the bottle. This visual connection is both literal and symbolic, emphasizing the brand's message. Given the clear depiction of these connecting streams, the answer is affirmative.",
