      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right-side skier casts a distinct shadow on the snow directly beneath and slightly behind them. The shadow is elongated and sharp, indicating strong directional lighting from above and slightly in front, consistent with a high sun angle typical of midday in mountainous regions. The shadow's placement relative to the skier’s position suggests that the skier is close to the ground and not elevated, which contributes to a sense of depth. However, the shadow does not extend significantly forward or appear distorted in a way that would suggest extreme proximity to the viewer. Instead, it appears natural and proportionate to the skier’s height and the slope angle. Therefore, while the shadow adds depth, it does not strongly suggest the skier is unusually close to the viewer compared to other elements in the scene.",

      "question": "Are there motion lines or blurring effects around the edges of the right-side skier to simulate movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no visible motion lines or blurring effects along the edges of the right-side skier. The skier’s form is sharp and clearly defined, with clean outlines on the jacket, helmet, skis, and poles. In real-world photography or realistic digital rendering, fast-moving subjects often exhibit some degree of motion blur, especially at the extremities (e.g., arms, legs, skis). However, here the skier appears static in terms of visual clarity, despite being in a dynamic pose. This lack of blur suggests either a high shutter speed in a photographic simulation or an artistic choice to emphasize clarity over realism. The snow spray behind the skier indicates motion, but the skier themselves remain crisp and unblurred. Thus, no motion lines or blurring are present around the skier’s edges.",

      "question": "Has the right-side skier been repositioned to appear significantly closer to the viewer than any other objects in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right-side skier is positioned prominently in the foreground, appearing larger and more detailed than the second skier in the background. This size difference, combined with perspective cues such as overlapping and relative scale, suggests that the skier is indeed closer to the viewer. Additionally, the skier’s body fills a significant portion of the frame, while the background mountains and the second skier are smaller and further away. This compositional technique—using size, depth of field, and spatial arrangement—is commonly used in photography and visual art to create a sense of depth and foreground emphasis. Compared to Image A, where both skiers are more evenly spaced and balanced in the frame, Image B has clearly shifted focus by enlarging and advancing the right-side skier, making them dominate the visual space. This repositioning creates a stronger sense of immediacy and proximity to the viewer.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the right-side skier positioned at an angle that simulates leaning forward or moving closer toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right-side skier in Image B is angled such that their upper body is leaning slightly forward, with their head and torso tilted down the slope. Their skis are parallel and pointed downward, and their poles are angled backward, which is consistent with a downhill skiing posture. Importantly, the skier’s orientation is not directly facing the viewer but rather skewed diagonally across the frame, creating a dynamic sense of movement. This diagonal lean, combined with the direction of the skis and the snow spray, gives the impression that the skier is actively descending and moving toward the lower part of the image—effectively simulating forward momentum. While they are not literally moving toward the viewer, the angle and posture create a visual illusion of approaching the viewer due to the perspective and composition. This is reinforced by the fact that the skier appears larger and more dominant in the frame, enhancing the perception of forward motion and closeness.",
