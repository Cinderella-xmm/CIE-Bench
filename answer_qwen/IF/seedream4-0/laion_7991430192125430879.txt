    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire bottle constructed entirely from LEGO bricks, with no realistic glass or plastic elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle appears to be fully constructed from LEGO bricks. The surface texture is consistent with LEGO pieces, showing studs and blocky patterns typical of LEGO construction. The neck and cap are also made of stacked LEGO bricks, with no visible transparent or smooth glass-like material that would suggest real glass or plastic. The entire structure mimics the shape of a Bacardi Mojito bottle but uses only LEGO elements. There are no signs of actual liquid, glass transparency, or plastic seams that would indicate non-LEGO materials. Based on visual inspection and knowledge of LEGO construction, this is a complete LEGO recreation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the body and sides of the bottle built using translucent green LEGO bricks?",
    "explanation": "The body of the LEGO bottle in Image B is composed of green LEGO bricks. Upon close observation, the bricks have a translucent quality, allowing light to pass through slightly, which gives them a glowing effect similar to the original bottle's green hue. This translucency is characteristic of certain LEGO brick types used for creating realistic effects like glass or liquid. The color matches the original bottle’s green tint, and the use of translucent bricks enhances the illusion of a real bottle filled with liquid. This aligns with common LEGO design practices for simulating drink bottles.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the label area composed of multicolored LEGO blocks representing the original design elements (logo, text, colors)?",
    "explanation": "The label area in Image B is clearly constructed from various colored LEGO bricks. It includes white, black, red, yellow, and green blocks arranged to mimic the Bacardi logo, the 'Mojito' text, and other design elements such as the bat emblem and decorative borders. These elements are not printed on a single piece but are assembled using individual bricks to replicate the original label’s layout and colors. The attention to detail suggests an intentional effort to recreate the branding using LEGO’s modular system, which supports the use of multiple colors and shapes to form complex designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the cap made from smooth, circular blue LEGO bricks and does it maintain a cylindrical shape?",
    "explanation": "The cap in Image B is constructed from blue LEGO bricks stacked vertically. The bricks appear to be round or circular in shape, forming a cylindrical structure that matches the top of the bottle. While LEGO bricks are typically not perfectly smooth due to their stud texture, the overall appearance is consistent with a stack of round bricks designed to simulate a smooth cap. The cylindrical shape is preserved, and the blue color corresponds to the cap’s intended look. This construction method is common in LEGO builds to replicate bottle caps with a clean, rounded form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO bottle placed on a minimalist white shelf against a neutral or white background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bottle is positioned on a clean, flat white shelf that extends horizontally. The shelf has a simple, modern design with no ornamentation, fitting the description of a minimalist style. The background is uniformly white and uncluttered, providing a neutral setting that emphasizes the LEGO model. This setup is typical for product photography or display purposes, where the focus is on the object without distractions. The lighting is even, further supporting the idea of a controlled, studio-like environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all brand texts (e.g., 'Bacardi,' 'Mojito,' 'Classic Cocktails') visibly rendered in blocky LEGO-style lettering and legible?",
    "explanation": "The text on the LEGO bottle in Image B, including 'Bacardi,' 'Mojito,' and 'Classic Cocktails,' is formed using individual LEGO bricks arranged to create letters. The font style is inherently blocky due to the nature of LEGO construction, with each character built from square or rectangular pieces. Despite the blockiness, the text remains legible, especially for larger words like 'Bacardi' and 'Mojito.' The contrast between the black, white, and green bricks ensures readability. This reflects standard LEGO techniques for rendering text in models, where clarity is achieved through size, color contrast, and spacing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the LEGO bottle display clear sculptural features such as defined edges, depth, and 3D form to emphasize its construction?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO bottle in Image B exhibits strong sculptural qualities. The body has well-defined edges and curves that follow the contour of a real bottle, with visible depth created by the layered arrangement of bricks. The transition from the neck to the body is smooth yet clearly segmented, emphasizing the three-dimensional nature of the build. Shadows and lighting highlight the texture and volume, reinforcing the 3D form. This level of detail indicates a high-quality LEGO construction designed to mimic the physical presence of a real object while showcasing the modular building technique.",
    "answer": "Yes"
