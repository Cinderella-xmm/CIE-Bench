      "question": "Is the capybara's body rendered as a polished bronze metallic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara is depicted as a sculpture with a highly reflective, metallic finish consistent with polished bronze. The surface exhibits smooth, lustrous highlights and shadows typical of metal, especially in areas like the snout, cheeks, and neck. The texture lacks any signs of fur or organic material, which would be expected in a real animal. Instead, fine engraved lines mimic fur patterns, reinforcing the impression that this is not a living creature but a metallic representation. Given that the entire visible portion of the capybara—including its facial features, whiskers, and even the glasses—shares this uniform metallic sheen, it is reasonable to conclude that the body is rendered as a polished bronze surface. This conclusion aligns with common artistic practices where animals are sculpted in metal for decorative or commemorative purposes.",

      "question": "Has the blue knitted hat been replaced with an intricately detailed bronze helmet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headgear worn by the capybara is no longer a soft, blue knitted hat as seen in Image A. Instead, it is a rigid, ornate helmet made of the same bronze material as the rest of the sculpture. The helmet features embossed decorative elements, including a fleur-de-lis-like motif on top and ventilation slots on the sides, suggesting a historical or ceremonial design. These details are inconsistent with the soft, textured appearance of a knitted hat. By comparing the two images, we can see that the original blue hat has been entirely replaced with this metallic helmet, indicating a transformation from a casual winter accessory to a more formal, stylized piece. This change reflects a shift in artistic style—from realistic and cozy to classical and monumental.",

      "question": "Are the sunglasses now composed of glass lenses set in bronze frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunglasses in Image B appear to have transparent lenses that reflect light and surroundings, consistent with glass or clear acrylic materials. The frames, however, are seamlessly integrated into the bronze surface of the sculpture, matching the color and texture of the helmet and face. The edges of the frames show the same metallic finish and slight wear patterns as the rest of the sculpture, indicating they are part of the same bronze casting rather than separate components. While the lenses themselves may be glass (as they allow visibility of the eyes behind them), their integration into the bronze structure suggests a composite design where the frame is bronze and the lenses are likely glass. This combination is plausible in sculptural art, where functional-looking accessories are often created using durable materials. Thus, the sunglasses are indeed composed of glass lenses set in bronze frames.",

      "question": "Are the fur patterns preserved as engraved lines on the bronze surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara’s fur is not represented through actual fur but through fine, incised lines etched into the bronze surface. These lines follow the natural direction of fur growth, particularly around the cheeks, chin, and neck, mimicking the texture and flow of real fur. This technique is commonly used in metal sculptures to suggest organic textures without replicating them physically. The lines are uniform and precise, characteristic of engraving or casting methods used in metalwork. In contrast, Image A shows soft, fluffy fur with natural variation in texture and color. The transition from real fur to engraved lines demonstrates a deliberate artistic choice to preserve the visual suggestion of fur while adapting it to the medium of bronze. Therefore, the fur patterns are indeed preserved as engraved lines on the bronze surface.",

      "question": "Is the sculpture placed on a plain, understated marble base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bronze capybara sculpture resting on a white base with subtle gray veining, characteristic of marble. The base is rectangular and unadorned, lacking any intricate carvings or decorative elements, which gives it a minimalist and elegant appearance. Its clean lines and neutral tone complement the sculpture without drawing attention away from it. This type of presentation is common in museum displays or fine art installations, where the focus remains on the artwork itself. The base appears solid and well-proportioned, providing stability and enhancing the overall aesthetic. Compared to Image A, which shows no such base, the addition of this marble plinth in Image B elevates the object from a whimsical portrait to a formal sculpture. Therefore, the sculpture is indeed placed on a plain, understated marble base.",
