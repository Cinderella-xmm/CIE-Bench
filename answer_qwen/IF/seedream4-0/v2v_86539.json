      "question": "Do the characters in the edited image have bold ink outlines and vibrant flat colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are depicted with thick, clearly defined black outlines that separate them from the background, which is a hallmark of bold ink outlines commonly used in comic art. The coloration is consistent and uniform across each character and object, without gradients or shading, indicating flat coloring. These visual traits—bold outlines and flat, vibrant colors—are typical of cartoon or comic book styles, especially those aiming for a clean, stylized aesthetic. This style enhances readability and emphasizes the whimsical nature of the characters. Based on these observations, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Are the characters situated in distinct zones within the panel that hint at their respective activities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is divided into three panels, each depicting a different scene involving the same potato-like character engaged in a specific activity. The top panel shows the character exercising in a gym setting, complete with fitness equipment like a barbell and punching bag. The bottom-left panel features the character sleeping inside a cardboard box, suggesting a cozy, enclosed space. The bottom-right panel presents the character sitting at a small table with food and drink, indicating a dining scenario. Each zone is visually separated and contextually distinct, providing clear cues about the character's activity. This spatial organization reflects common comic storytelling techniques where different scenes are compartmentalized to convey narrative progression. Therefore, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Is there a miniature gym corner present for the exercising figure with a green headband?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the top panel of Image B, the character wearing a green headband is shown in a room equipped with various gym apparatuses: a barbell on a rack, a weight bench, a multi-station machine, and a red punching bag. These items collectively form a gym environment. The presence of such detailed equipment suggests a dedicated workout area, even if it's not labeled as 'miniature'—the scale relative to the character implies a proportionate, albeit compact, setup. Given that the character is actively walking or jogging in place, this reinforces the idea of an exercise routine. Thus, the scene functions as a gym corner tailored to the character’s size and activity. Hence, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Is there a cozy cardboard box nook for the figure sleeping in a cardboard box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom-left panel of Image B depicts the potato-like character lying down inside a large cardboard box lined with white bedding, resembling a makeshift bed. The box is positioned on the floor, and the interior appears snug and sheltered, with soft padding visible beneath the character. The surrounding elements, such as a small flower near the box, contribute to a warm, comforting atmosphere. This setup strongly suggests a personal, intimate space designed for rest—a 'cozy nook.' While not explicitly labeled, the visual cues (bedding, enclosure, relaxed posture) align with the concept of a cozy sleeping area. Therefore, the answer is yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the bottom-right panel of Image B, the character is seated at a small round table with a bowl of soup, a spoon, a smartphone, and a napkin. The table is scaled to match the character’s size, indicating it is a miniature dining setup. The character is holding a spoon and appears to be enjoying a meal, reinforcing the idea of a dining scene. Although the space is minimalistic and lacks elaborate decor, the presence of a table and food items clearly defines it as a dining area. The term 'tiny' is appropriate given the proportional scale relative to the character. Thus, the answer is yes.",
