This type of embellishment is commonly found in Baroque and Rococo furniture to emphasize wealth and craftsmanship. The contrast between the gold framework and the dark red drapes further highlights the gilded elements. Therefore, the presence of gold-colored decorative woodwork is clearly evident.",
