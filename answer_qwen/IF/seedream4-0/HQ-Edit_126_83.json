      "question": "Is the figure displayed within a wooden shadow box that creates a 3D miniature scene effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is enclosed within a light-colored wooden frame with depth, which appears to be a shadow box. The three-dimensional arrangement of the figure and background elements—such as the cherry blossom tree—suggests that this is not a flat image but a layered diorama-like display. The visible depth behind the figure, along with the realistic shadows and perspective, indicates a 3D miniature scene effect. Shadow boxes are commonly used in art and collectibles to create such immersive, layered presentations, especially for culturally themed figures or dolls. This visual setup aligns with the definition of a shadow box display.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the background rendered in soft pastel tones (e.g., light pink, peach, mint, or lavender)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a warm, muted color palette dominated by soft pink and beige tones. These colors are consistent with the description of soft pastels. The wall behind the shadow box is a gentle pink, while the interior backdrop of the shadow box itself is a deeper but still subdued brownish-pink tone. The overall aesthetic avoids harsh contrasts and leans into delicate, harmonious hues typical of pastel rendering. This choice of color enhances the serene and refined mood of the scene, which is often associated with traditional East Asian art styles.",

      "question": "Are there visible tiny embroidered floral patterns on the hanbok's fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the hanbok in Image B, the fabric displays intricate floral embroidery, particularly along the sleeves and lower sections of the top (jeogori) and skirt (chima). These patterns include small blossoms and leaves in shades of pink, white, and red, consistent with traditional Korean textile designs. The fine detail and repetition suggest embroidery rather than printed patterns. Such embellishments are characteristic of formal hanbok attire, where hand-stitched floral motifs symbolize nature and elegance. The clarity and texture in the image confirm these are intentional decorative elements.",

      "question": "Is a delicate fan present in the figure’s hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is holding a small, folded fan in her right hand. The fan has a light wooden frame and is decorated with floral patterns that match the hanbok’s design. Fans are traditional accessories in Korean culture, often used both functionally and symbolically in performances and formal wear. The presence of this fan adds cultural authenticity and complements the overall aesthetic. It is clearly visible and distinct from any other object, confirming its inclusion in the scene.",

      "question": "Is there a small blooming cherry blossom tree visible behind the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Behind the figure in Image B, there is a stylized representation of a cherry blossom tree with branches extending upward and adorned with pink flowers. While it may not be a full-sized tree, its size and placement within the shadow box suggest it is a miniature version designed to enhance the scenic depth. Cherry blossoms are deeply symbolic in Korean culture, representing transience and beauty. Their inclusion here reinforces the cultural and seasonal theme, likely evoking springtime. The tree is clearly visible and contributes to the layered composition.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are multiple culturally significant elements (hanbok, fan, cherry blossom, shadow box) arranged in a way that suggests layered narrative and cultural refinement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B integrates several culturally meaningful elements: the hanbok (traditional Korean clothing), the folding fan (a common accessory in Korean art and performance), the cherry blossom tree (symbolic of spring and impermanence in East Asian aesthetics), and the shadow box (a modern artistic presentation method that elevates the figure to a curated artifact). These components are thoughtfully arranged in a layered, three-dimensional space that mimics a diorama. The combination reflects a deliberate effort to convey cultural heritage through visual storytelling. The use of soft lighting, harmonious colors, and detailed craftsmanship further emphasizes refinement. Together, these elements form a cohesive narrative that celebrates traditional Korean beauty and artistry in a contemporary, curated format.",
