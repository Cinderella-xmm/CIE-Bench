      "question": "Is the robot presented in a manner consistent with a futuristic tech gadget advertisement, such as with professional lighting, clean layout, and product-focused styling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B is displayed against a dark, almost black background that enhances its visual prominence. The lighting is dramatic, with strong highlights and reflections on the robot’s surface, suggesting studio-quality illumination commonly used in high-end product photography. The composition centers the robot, emphasizing its form and details, while minimizing distractions. This setup aligns with typical aesthetics of futuristic tech advertisements, which aim to highlight sleek design and advanced features through minimalistic, high-contrast visuals. The overall presentation is polished and stylized, focusing attention on the robot as a premium product.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the robot’s surface exhibit a glossy, reflective metallic finish across its body panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the robot's body panels display significant reflections and highlights, particularly on the silver and gray sections. These reflections suggest a polished, metallic surface rather than matte plastic or painted material. The way light interacts with the surface—creating sharp specular highlights and mirror-like effects—indicates a glossy finish. This is further supported by the presence of ambient occlusion and subtle color bleeding from surrounding elements (like the blue UI glow), which only occur on reflective surfaces. Such finishes are common in digital renderings of high-tech machinery to convey advanced materials like titanium or alloy composites.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible holographic display elements located on the robot's chest, characterized by glowing or semi-transparent digital patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chest area of the robot features translucent, glowing blue elements that resemble a digital interface. These elements include geometric shapes, lines, and what appear to be data readouts or status indicators, all rendered with a soft glow and transparency typical of holographic displays. The design mimics augmented reality overlays often seen in sci-fi media, where information is projected directly onto a device or suit. The contrast between these glowing areas and the darker parts of the robot confirms their role as active, illuminated interfaces rather than static decals.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a digital interface overlay present in the image that includes control icons such as buttons, sliders, or menus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows multiple floating digital elements around the robot, especially in the upper right and left regions. These include rectangular panels with circular dials, bar graphs, and icon-based controls such as plus signs, arrows, and toggle switches. These elements are styled like user interface components from a futuristic operating system, resembling touch-screen or heads-up display (HUD) elements. Their placement and design suggest they represent an interactive control system, possibly linked to the robot’s functions. This kind of overlay is characteristic of conceptual tech ads showcasing smart integration and AI-driven systems.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there visible sleek branding, such as a logo or stylized text, integrated into the robot’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the detailed rendering and numerous visual elements, there is no visible logo, brand name, or stylized text anywhere on the robot’s body in Image B. While some panels have small markings or symbols (e.g., circular indicators), none resemble official branding. In contrast, many commercial product images feature logos prominently placed for recognition. The absence of such elements suggests this may be a concept model or promotional art without specific brand affiliation. Therefore, based on visual inspection alone, no branding is evident.",

      "question": "Is there a smartwatch-like accessory attached to the robot’s arm, appearing detachable and magnetic in design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the robot’s left forearm in Image B, there is a wrist-mounted device that closely resembles a modern smartwatch. It has a rectangular screen displaying colorful app icons, similar to those found on wearable technology. The device appears to be secured with a band and has a distinct separation point, suggesting it could be detached. Its design includes a sleek casing and digital interface, consistent with magnetic or snap-on attachments seen in advanced wearables. Given the context of the image as a tech showcase, this accessory likely serves as a control interface or status monitor, reinforcing the futuristic theme.",

      "question": "Is the background of the image entirely sleek black, without any gradients, textures, or distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is predominantly black, but it is not uniformly flat. There are subtle gradients and faint reflections near the base of the robot, indicating a slightly reflective floor surface. Additionally, the digital UI elements floating in the background introduce non-uniform visual content, breaking the simplicity of a pure black backdrop. While the background remains minimalist and uncluttered, the presence of these gradients and interface overlays means it is not entirely 'sleek black' in the strictest sense. A truly uniform black background would lack any variation or embedded graphics.",

      "question": "Are there floating tech interface symbols, such as digital icons or UI elements, present in the scene around the robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, Image B contains several floating digital elements surrounding the robot. These include HUD-style panels with icons, gauges, and control symbols such as plus signs, directional arrows, and circular dials. These elements are positioned in mid-air, giving the impression of a virtual interface projecting from or interacting with the robot. This use of floating UI components is common in science fiction and tech advertising to imply advanced connectivity, real-time data processing, or AI integration. Their presence adds depth to the scene and emphasizes the robot’s technological sophistication.",
