      "question": "Are the mountains rendered as geometric shapes with sharp angles and flat surfaces instead of realistic contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are clearly composed of angular, polygonal forms with distinct edges and flat planes. These shapes lack the smooth, rounded contours typical of natural mountain ranges. Instead, they resemble abstract or stylized representations using facets and sharp transitions between colors and planes, which is characteristic of geometric art styles such as cubism or low-poly design. This departure from realism suggests a deliberate artistic choice to emphasize form over naturalism. The visual cues—such as abrupt changes in color and direction at mountain ridges—support the conclusion that these are not realistic but rather geometrically constructed.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the trees depicted as geometric forms, such as triangular or stepped shapes, with no realistic leaf details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are simplified into basic geometric shapes—most notably triangles and trapezoids—with solid fills and sharp outlines. There are no detailed textures or individual leaves; instead, each tree appears as a blocky, stylized silhouette. For example, coniferous trees are represented by solid green triangles, while deciduous trees are shown as layered, angular blocks of red, orange, and yellow. This abstraction aligns with graphic design principles where organic forms are reduced to symbolic geometry. Realistic foliage would include variation in texture, shading, and branching patterns, none of which are present here.",

      "question": "Is the river composed of a series of radiating parallel lines rather than a continuous, reflective body of water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The river in Image B is visually defined by a pattern of evenly spaced, parallel blue and white stripes that converge toward the horizon, creating a strong sense of perspective. These lines do not represent ripples or reflections in a natural water surface but instead form a stylized, almost optical illusion-like effect. In contrast to a realistic river, which would show subtle gradients, light refraction, and irregularities, this version uses repetitive linear elements to suggest movement and depth. This technique is common in modern graphic art and vector illustrations, where form and rhythm take precedence over physical accuracy.",

      "question": "Are all elements in the image outlined with bold, clear lines and filled with solid, unshaded colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Every object in Image B—including mountains, trees, sky, and river—is delineated by crisp, black or dark-colored outlines. The fill colors are uniform within each shape, with minimal to no internal shading or gradient. For instance, the sky consists of horizontal bands of flat color (blue, orange, yellow), and the mountains are segmented into colored polygons without soft transitions. This style mimics vector graphics or illustrative design, where clarity and simplicity are prioritized. Such characteristics are consistent with digital art or graphic design approaches that avoid realistic lighting and texture.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the reflection in the water a perfectly symmetrical and geometrically aligned mirror image of the foreground elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection in the river of Image B is not a naturalistic representation but a highly stylized one. It mirrors the shapes of the surrounding trees and terrain with perfect symmetry along the vertical axis of the river. Each tree and mountain form is duplicated directly below, maintaining exact proportions and alignment. However, this symmetry is exaggerated and lacks the slight distortions or blurring that occur in real water reflections due to surface tension and movement. The reflection follows the same geometric language as the rest of the scene, reinforcing its artificial, idealized nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there any visible gradients or soft shading in the sky, mountains, or water, or are all areas filled with flat, solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection, Image B does not feature gradual transitions or soft shading. The sky is made up of distinct horizontal bands of color (e.g., blue, orange, yellow) with sharp boundaries between them. Similarly, the mountains and trees consist of flat, solid-colored polygons with no blending or tonal variation. Even the river, though composed of striped lines, uses consistent color values without gradation. This absence of atmospheric effects like fog, light diffusion, or shadowing indicates a deliberate use of flat color, typical of graphic illustration or digital art styles that prioritize clarity and visual impact over realism.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the image use a vibrant, high-contrast color palette typical of Art Deco design, including bold hues like red, gold, blue, and black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a striking color scheme dominated by vivid reds, oranges, yellows, blues, and greens, all set against darker outlines and backgrounds. The contrast between warm and cool tones is pronounced, especially in the sky and landscape elements. The use of geometric patterns, symmetry, and bold lines further aligns with Art Deco aesthetics, which often feature stylized forms and luxurious color combinations. While not strictly adhering to historical Art Deco motifs, the overall visual language—characterized by opulence, symmetry, and dynamic composition—echoes the movement's influence in modern graphic design. Thus, the palette and style reflect key traits associated with Art Deco-inspired art.",
