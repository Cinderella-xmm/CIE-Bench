      "question": "Is the title \"The Saga of the Heroic Bread Warrior\" displayed prominently in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the title 'The Saga of the Heroic Bread Warrior' is visible on the left side of the image. It is written in a stylized font with a mix of colors—brown for 'The Saga of' and red for 'the Heroic Bread Warrior'—and appears to be positioned above a block of narrative text. While it is clearly readable, its placement is not central or dominant in the overall composition. The sandwich logo and knight character occupy more prominent visual space. However, given that it is placed at the beginning of the story section and is large enough to stand out relative to surrounding text, it can be considered prominently displayed within its designated area. This judgment is based on the relative size, color contrast, and position compared to other elements in the lower-left quadrant.",

      "question": "Does the sandwich have bread armor and a leafy lettuce cape as part of its design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich itself is depicted as a standard sandwich with whole wheat bread, lettuce, and tomato. There is no visual representation of the sandwich wearing armor or having a lettuce cape. Instead, the knight character to the left of the sandwich is armored and wears a green cape resembling lettuce. The sandwich remains an inert food item without anthropomorphic features. The idea of 'bread armor' and 'lettuce cape' may stem from a metaphorical interpretation of the knight's appearance, but these attributes are not applied directly to the sandwich. Therefore, based on direct visual evidence, the sandwich does not possess such features.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a timeline at the bottom of the image depicting the bread knight's quest using whimsical hand-drawn illustrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there is indeed a horizontal line running across the bottom of the image, marked with circular nodes. Along this line, there are several small, cartoon-style illustrations depicting scenes involving the knight character, including one where he is fighting, another where he is conquering hunger, and others showing action sequences. These illustrations are drawn in a playful, hand-drawn style consistent with comic book aesthetics. The sequence suggests a chronological narrative of the 'bread knight’s quest,' supported by accompanying text. This structure matches the definition of a timeline, especially when combined with the thematic progression of events. Thus, the presence of both the visual sequence and narrative supports the conclusion that a whimsical timeline exists.",

      "question": "Are the narrative texts in the image rendered in bold, comic-style font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The narrative text beneath the timeline in Image B is written in a small, somewhat irregular script that resembles handwritten or typewriter-style font rather than a bold, comic-style font. While some words like 'BREAD KNIGHTS' are emphasized with larger, stylized lettering, most of the body text is not bold and lacks the exaggerated shapes, thick outlines, or dynamic angles typical of comic-style fonts. The font choice appears more casual and whimsical but not specifically bold or comic-like. Therefore, despite some stylistic flourishes, the majority of the narrative text does not meet the criteria of being rendered in a bold, comic-style font.",

      "question": "Are vibrant and contrasting colors used throughout the image to emphasize key elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a wide range of vivid colors: the knight has bright green and orange accents, the ribbon is deep magenta, the sandwich includes green lettuce and red tomato, and the background illustrations use yellow bursts and pink borders. These high-contrast colors draw attention to specific elements such as the knight, the timeline icons, and the sandwich logo. The use of bright yellows, pinks, greens, and reds against a white background enhances visual appeal and guides focus. Such color choices are characteristic of promotional or storytelling graphics designed to engage viewers. Hence, the image clearly uses vibrant and contrasting colors strategically to highlight important parts.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two circular icons are located on the right side of the image. Each contains a dynamic scene: one shows a battle between knights over sandwiches, and the other depicts a knight charging forward with a sword. Both are framed with radiating lines and energetic effects (like stars and motion lines), suggesting action. Their placement is off-center and slightly elevated, creating a sense of movement and emphasis. These elements match the description of 'circular icons depicting action scenes' and are integrated into the layout in a way that feels dynamic rather than static. Therefore, based on their form, content, and positioning, they qualify as such.",

      "question": "Is the overall layout of the image in landscape orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is wider than it is tall, with a horizontal spread that includes the knight on the left, the sandwich logo in the center, and the timeline and icons extending across the bottom and right sides. This aspect ratio is typical of landscape orientation, which is commonly used for presentations, banners, and storytelling layouts to accommodate multiple visual elements side by side. The content flows horizontally, supporting the timeline and narrative structure. Based on the proportions and arrangement of elements, the layout is clearly in landscape orientation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is organized into distinct visual zones: the left side features the knight character and the title 'The Saga of the Heroic Bread Warrior'; the center showcases the sandwich logo with the brand name; the bottom displays a timeline with illustrations and text; and the right side contains two circular action icons. Each section serves a different narrative or branding function and is spatially separated from the others through placement, spacing, and visual hierarchy. This segmentation allows viewers to follow the story logically and understand each component’s role. Thus, the image effectively uses clear visual divisions to organize its content.",
