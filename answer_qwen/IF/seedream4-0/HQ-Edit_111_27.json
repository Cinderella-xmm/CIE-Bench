      "question": "Does the geisha's figure appear as a stained glass artwork with distinct lead-like outlines separating colored sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire composition exhibits characteristics of stained glass art. The geisha's figure is segmented into various colored areas, each separated by dark, linear outlines that mimic the lead cames used in traditional stained glass windows. These lines are consistent in thickness and placement, forming geometric and organic boundaries around color fields. This technique is characteristic of stained glass, where individual pieces of colored glass are held together by metal frames. The visual texture, including the way light appears to refract through the colors and the fragmented appearance of the skin, clothing, and hair, strongly supports the interpretation that the image is rendered in a stained glass style. Therefore, the geisha's figure is indeed presented as a stained glass artwork.",

      "question": "Are the kimono patterns composed of flowing, curvilinear organic designs such as vines or flowers, rendered in vivid jewel tones (e.g., deep reds, blues, greens)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kimono in Image B displays intricate patterns that include floral motifs, swirling vines, and other naturalistic elements typical of traditional Japanese textile design. These patterns are not only organic in form but also follow flowing, curvilinear lines that enhance the aesthetic of movement and elegance. The color palette includes rich, saturated hues such as deep reds, emerald greens, royal blues, and golden yellows—colors often associated with jewel tones. These colors are further accentuated by the stained glass effect, which gives them a luminous, translucent quality. The overall design aligns with both traditional kimono aesthetics and the decorative richness seen in Art Nouveau stained glass works. Thus, the kimono patterns meet the criteria described in the question.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms depicted as glass-like elements with segmented petals, dark outlines, and translucent coloring typical of stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cherry blossoms in Image B are clearly stylized to resemble stained glass. Each petal is delineated by dark, thick lines that simulate lead cames, dividing the flower into distinct segments. The coloring within these segments is translucent and layered, mimicking the way light passes through colored glass. Additionally, the edges of the petals show variations in tone and opacity, contributing to a sense of depth and translucency. The branches supporting the blossoms also have a similar treatment, with segmented forms and dark outlines. This stylistic choice is consistent with stained glass techniques, where floral elements are often abstracted into geometric yet organic shapes with defined borders. Hence, the depiction of the cherry blossoms matches the description of stained glass elements.",

      "question": "Has the traditional hand fan been replaced with a peacock-style fan featuring eye-patterned feathers and iridescent, multi-colored surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand fan held by the geisha is distinctly different from a traditional Japanese folding fan. Instead of plain or subtly patterned paper, it features elaborate, eye-shaped patterns resembling those found on peacock feathers. These patterns are rendered in vibrant, iridescent hues—shades of blue, green, gold, and purple—that shift in tone depending on the angle, simulating the optical effects of real peacock plumage. The structure of the fan also follows an organic, feather-like arrangement rather than a rigid grid. This transformation from a conventional fan to a more fantastical, ornamental one is consistent with artistic reinterpretations seen in decorative arts. Therefore, the fan has indeed been replaced with a peacock-style design.",

      "question": "Is the background composed of curving, interwoven lines and shaded areas forming an abstract mosaic pattern consistent with Art Nouveau design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a complex network of curving, flowing lines that intertwine and spiral outward, creating a dynamic, organic rhythm. These lines are filled with varying shades of blue, green, and yellow, forming an abstract mosaic-like pattern. The use of asymmetrical curves, natural motifs (such as floral and vine-like elements), and the emphasis on fluidity and harmony are hallmarks of the Art Nouveau style. Furthermore, the integration of stained glass techniques enhances this aesthetic, as Art Nouveau artists like Louis Comfort Tiffany frequently employed stained glass in their work. The overall composition evokes the same sense of movement and decorative complexity seen in Art Nouveau mosaics and stained glass panels. Thus, the background aligns well with Art Nouveau design principles.",
