      "question": "Is the image split into two distinct panels, one on the left and one on the right (or top and bottom), forming a comic layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is clearly divided into two vertical sections. The left panel features an anthropomorphic bear in a classroom setting, while the right panel shows a salmon leaping from water with a life cycle diagram. This side-by-side arrangement resembles a comic or educational infographic layout, where each panel serves a different but related purpose—introducing a question and then providing an answer or explanation. The visual separation is marked by a clear vertical line, confirming the split into two distinct panels.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does Panel 1 show the bear wearing spectacles and displaying a wise or thoughtful facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1, the bear is depicted with round glasses perched on its nose, which are commonly associated with wisdom or scholarly behavior. Its facial features include a long white beard and a calm, slightly raised eyebrow expression, reinforcing a thoughtful or intellectual demeanor. These visual cues align with typical representations of wise characters in animated or educational media. Therefore, based on the visual elements and common symbolic associations, the bear appears to be portrayed as wise.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a speech bubble in Panel 1 containing the text: “Ever wondered how a salmon ends up in a bear's mouth?”",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A speech bubble is present in Panel 1, originating from the bear. The text inside reads: 'Ever wondered how a salmon a salmon ends up in a bear’s mouth?' There is a noticeable repetition of the word 'salmon,' which may be a typo, but the core message matches the intended question. Given that the exact phrasing includes the repeated word, it does not perfectly match the query. However, the intent and content are very close. Since the question asks for an exact match, and the text contains a duplication error, the correct answer must reflect that it is not precisely as stated.",

      "question": "Does Panel 2 show a salmon emerging from bubbling water into a visual chart with labeled stages: 'egg', 'fry', 'smolt', 'adult'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 depicts a salmon mid-leap out of water, with visible bubbles indicating movement and splash. Below the surface, a vertical chart illustrates the life stages of a salmon, labeled sequentially from bottom to top as 'egg', 'fry', 'smolt', and 'adult'. These labels are clearly visible and correctly ordered, representing the biological progression of salmon development. The visual integration of the fish’s leap with the life cycle chart suggests a narrative connection between the animal’s journey and its lifecycle, supporting the educational intent.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a fact box in Panel 2 containing the text: “Journey's end in the river gives life to the forest.”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2, there is a white rectangular box located in the lower-right corner, resembling a fact box. The text inside reads: 'Journey's end in the river gives life to the forest.' Although some words appear distorted (e.g., 'tn' instead of 'in'), the overall message is intelligible and matches the intended phrase. Given that the core sentence structure and meaning are preserved despite minor rendering errors, it can be concluded that the text is present and conveys the intended ecological concept—the role of salmon in nutrient cycling between rivers and forests.",

      "question": "Are all text elements (speech bubble, labels, fact box) rendered in a clear, modern sans-serif font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in the speech bubble, the life stage labels ('egg', 'fry', 'smolt', 'adult'), and the fact box all use a clean, legible typeface consistent with modern sans-serif fonts. The letters have uniform stroke weights and lack serifs, which is characteristic of sans-serif styles. While there are slight distortions in some letters (e.g., 'tn' instead of 'in'), the font style remains consistent across all text elements. This choice enhances readability and supports the educational tone of the image.",

      "question": "Are the water elements in Panel 2 depicted in blue hues and the forest background in Panel 1 shown in brown-green tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2, the water is rendered in various shades of blue, ranging from light turquoise near the surface to deeper blues below, accurately reflecting natural aquatic environments. In Panel 1, the forest background behind the bear features tall trees with green foliage and brown trunks, creating a typical woodland palette. The combination of green leaves and brown bark aligns with natural forest coloration. Thus, both panels adhere to realistic color schemes appropriate to their respective settings.",

      "question": "Does the overall image have an aspect ratio of 16:9?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is horizontally oriented and appears wide enough to fit a standard widescreen format. Observing the proportions, the width is significantly greater than the height, consistent with a 16:9 aspect ratio commonly used in digital displays and educational media. While precise pixel dimensions are not available, the visual balance and layout suggest a widescreen format designed for clarity and engagement in presentations or online content. This aspect ratio is typical for infographics and educational comics, further supporting the conclusion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 1 introduces a question via a wise-looking bear in a classroom, setting an educational tone. Panel 2 visually answers this question by showing the salmon life cycle and emphasizing the ecological role of salmon in sustaining forests. The two panels are thematically linked: the bear's curiosity leads to an explanation of the salmon's journey and its broader environmental impact. The visuals are clear, the text is informative (despite minor typos), and the layout encourages learning. Therefore, the image functions effectively as an educational tool, combining storytelling with scientific content.",
