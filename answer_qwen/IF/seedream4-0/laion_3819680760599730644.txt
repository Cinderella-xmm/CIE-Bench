    "Question": "Q1: Has the camera's lens been transformed into wide, expressive eyes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the camera has been anthropomorphized to resemble a cartoon character. The lens area is no longer just a functional optical component; instead, it features two large, white, oval-shaped eyes with black pupils placed directly over the lens. This artistic transformation uses the lens as a visual base for the eyes, giving the camera a lively and expressive face. This is a common technique in cartoon design where objects are given human-like features. The positioning and style of the eyes clearly indicate they are meant to represent facial features rather than the actual lens function. Therefore, the lens has been creatively reimagined into expressive eyes.",
