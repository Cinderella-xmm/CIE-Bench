    "Question": "Q1: Is the gorilla depicted in a Funko Pop-style box with an isometric perspective?",
    "explanation": "The image shows a Funko Pop-style box labeled 'JUNGLE KING' with a chibi-style figure inside. The box itself is presented in a three-dimensional view, but not from an isometric perspective. An isometric perspective would involve equal scaling along all three axes and a 30-degree angle between axes, giving a uniform, technical drawing-like appearance. Instead, the box is shown from a slightly angled front view, typical of product photography, which emphasizes depth and realism rather than isometric projection. Therefore, while the box is 3D-rendered, it does not use an isometric perspective.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the packaging include the title 'JUNGLE KING'?",
    "explanation": "The packaging clearly displays the text 'JUNGLE KING' in bold letters on the top and bottom sections of the box. This title is prominently featured alongside the Funko Pop logo, indicating that it is part of the product branding. The repetition of the title reinforces its significance and ensures visibility from multiple angles. This aligns with common practices in collectible toy packaging where the name of the character or theme is highlighted for recognition.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a chibi-style figure of the gorilla inside the box?",
    "explanation": "Inside the transparent window of the Funko Pop box, a stylized, chibi-style figure of a gorilla is visible. The figure has exaggerated features typical of Funko Pop designsâ€”large head, small body, and simplified facial expressions. It is dressed in jungle-themed attire, including a leafy crown and loincloth, consistent with the 'Jungle King' theme. The presence of this figure inside the box confirms that it is part of the product being displayed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Are the leafy crown, wooden staff, and jungle-themed details included with the chibi figure inside the box?",
    "explanation": "The chibi figure inside the box is adorned with a leafy crown on its head, matching the one worn by the figure outside the box. However, the wooden staff is not visible inside the box; instead, the figure appears to be holding nothing in its hands. The jungle-themed details such as the leafy crown and clothing are present, but the staff is missing from the boxed version. This discrepancy suggests that either the staff is not included or is stored separately within the box (not visible). Based on what can be seen, the staff is not visibly included with the figure inside the box.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is there a realistic illustration of the gorilla figure outside the box, with detailed textures and lighting?",
    "explanation": "Outside the box, there is a separate illustration of a realistic gorilla, standing upright and roaring. This depiction features highly detailed fur texture, anatomical accuracy, and dynamic lighting that enhances the sense of depth and realism. The background includes misty jungle foliage, further contributing to the lifelike atmosphere. This contrasts sharply with the stylized chibi figure inside the box, indicating that the external illustration is meant to represent a more authentic version of the character, possibly for marketing purposes. The level of detail and lighting effects confirm that this is indeed a realistic illustration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
