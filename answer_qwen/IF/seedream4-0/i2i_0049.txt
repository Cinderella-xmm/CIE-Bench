    "Question": "Q1: Is only one zebra visible in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a person cross-country skiing at a 'START' line in a snowy landscape. There is no zebra present in the image, either in the foreground or background. The scene includes snow-covered ground, trees, and a clear sky, but no animals are visible. Given that zebras are not naturally found in such snowy, forested environments, and none are depicted in the image, it is clear that there is no zebra at all. Therefore, the claim that 'only one zebra is visible' is false because no zebra exists in the image.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Has all the grass been removed from the background?",
    "explanation": "The background of the edited image (Image B) consists entirely of snow-covered ground and coniferous trees. There is no visible grass in the scene. Grass would typically appear as green vegetation, which is absent here due to the winter conditions. Since the entire terrain is covered in snow, any grass present in a non-winter version of this location would be obscured or completely buried. Thus, based on visual evidence and common knowledge about winter landscapes, all grass has effectively been removed or hidden by snow. This conclusion is consistent with typical seasonal changes in such environments.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the grass area replaced by a green gradient plane?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the ground is covered in snow, and there is no indication of a green gradient plane. A green gradient plane would imply a digitally added, smooth transition of green shades, often used in graphic design or photo editing for backgrounds. However, the snow appears natural and textured, consistent with real-world winter conditions. There is no artificial or stylized green surface visible. Therefore, the grass area has not been replaced by a green gradient plane; instead, it has been covered by snow. This conclusion is supported by both visual inspection and world knowledge about how natural landscapes appear in winter.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the edited image maintain a calm and solitary atmosphere without extra distractions?",
    "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) features a single skier at a 'START' line in a snowy, open field surrounded by trees. The environment is serene, with clear skies and minimal human activity visible beyond the skier. The composition focuses on the individual and the starting point, with no additional people, vehicles, or clutter in the frame. This simplicity contributes to a calm and solitary atmosphere. While the presence of the 'START' banner adds a competitive element, it does not introduce visual distraction but rather contextualizes the scene. Based on visual cues and common understanding of peaceful outdoor settings, the image maintains a tranquil mood. Thus, the atmosphere is indeed calm and undistracted.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the original zebra's position and appearance preserved in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "There is no zebra present in either the original or edited image. The scene depicts a cross-country skier in a snowy environment, with no animals visible. Since zebras are not native to such regions and are not shown in the image, there is no 'original zebra' to preserve. Therefore, the question of whether its position and appearance are preserved is mootâ€”the zebra never existed in the image to begin with. This conclusion is drawn from both visual analysis and biological/geographical knowledge about animal habitats.",
    "answer": "No"
