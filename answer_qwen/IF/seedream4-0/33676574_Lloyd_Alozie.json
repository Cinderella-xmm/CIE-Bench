      "question": "Do the skyscrapers appear as integrated, articulated robotic limbs forming a larger guardian-like figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several skyscrapers are visually altered to include mechanical-looking appendages extending from their sides, resembling robotic arms. These arms are connected to the buildings and have joints that suggest articulation. Additionally, the positioning of these structures—especially when viewed in relation to the overall skyline—creates an impression of a massive, humanoid or guardian-like entity. The arms extend outward and upward, with one arm appearing to reach toward a central structure, reinforcing the idea of a unified, sentient form. This transformation is not present in real-world architecture but is consistent with sci-fi or cyberpunk aesthetics where cities are personified as living machines. The visual design uses symmetry and scale to evoke the image of a guardian, with the buildings acting as parts of a larger mechanical being.",

      "question": "Are there visible neon circuitry patterns running along the facades of the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows prominent blue neon lines tracing vertical and horizontal paths across the surfaces of several skyscrapers. These lines resemble electronic circuit boards, with branching pathways and nodes that mimic the appearance of digital circuitry. This design choice is common in futuristic or cyberpunk-themed visuals, where urban environments are depicted as technologically advanced and interconnected. The glowing blue lines contrast sharply with the dark sky and other building lights, emphasizing their artificial, technological nature. In contrast, Image A displays natural architectural lighting without such stylized circuitry, confirming that this feature is an artistic addition in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the building facades feature reflective, scale-like panels arranged in an overlapping or segmented pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the facades of certain skyscrapers display a texture that resembles layered or segmented panels. These panels have a metallic sheen and are arranged in a way that mimics scales, particularly on the taller towers. The overlapping arrangement gives the impression of armor or exoskeletal plating, enhancing the robotic aesthetic. This effect is achieved through digital enhancement, where the original smooth glass surfaces of the buildings (as seen in Image A) are replaced with a textured, segmented look. Such design elements are typical in speculative fiction or futuristic art, where structures are imagined to have biological or mechanical qualities.",

      "question": "Are the expressways depicted as glowing, curving, spine-like structures emitting light and winding through the city?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roads and highways are rendered with bright, continuous light trails that follow curved paths through the urban landscape. These light trails resemble glowing veins or spines, suggesting a networked, organic system within the city. The long exposure effect creates streaks of light from vehicle movement, which are amplified in brightness and color to enhance the futuristic feel. The curvature and flow of these light paths give them a dynamic, almost living quality, reminiscent of a nervous system or circulatory network. While real highways do not glow in this manner, the artistic interpretation transforms them into symbolic, luminous structures that integrate with the cybernetic theme of the cityscape.",

      "question": "Do the tops of the buildings feature enhanced, fin-like vertical structures that resemble mechanical protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The upper sections of multiple skyscrapers in Image B show elongated, angular extensions that rise above the main structure. These protrusions have a sharp, geometric design and are illuminated with blue light, giving them a mechanical or antenna-like appearance. They resemble fins or spikes, possibly serving as sensors or communication arrays in a fictional context. In Image A, the same buildings have conventional architectural features such as spires or antennas, but they lack the exaggerated, stylized form seen in Image B. The addition of these fin-like structures enhances the robotic and high-tech atmosphere of the edited image.",

      "question": "Are there rotating holographic elements positioned across the skyline that resemble pulsing, eye-like forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes several circular, floating objects above the tallest buildings. These objects emit concentric rings of light and have a central core that pulses with red and blue hues, resembling eyes or energy cores. Their placement and rotation suggest they are holographic projections or floating interfaces, possibly part of a surveillance or defense system. The design evokes imagery from science fiction, where cities are monitored by advanced AI or overseen by sentient machines. In Image A, no such elements exist; the skyline is composed solely of physical structures and standard lighting. Therefore, these eye-like holograms are clearly added in the edited version to convey a sense of watchfulness and technological dominance.",
