      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is clearly a large, fantastical creature whose body is composed entirely of stone blocks and architectural elements resembling an ancient Mayan-style pyramid temple. The structure has a stepped pyramid form with staircases, carved stone textures, and overgrown vegetation, which are typical features of jungle temples. However, this pyramid-like structure is anthropomorphized—it has legs, claws, a tail, and a massive arm extending from one side—indicating it is not just a temple but a living or animated entity. This combination of temple architecture and animalistic features creates a unique creature that is fully depicted in its entirety, including limbs and head-like top. Therefore, it qualifies as a full-body depiction of a creature inspired by the ancient jungle temple.",

      "question": "Does the creature's design incorporate retro aesthetics commonly found in Japanese RPG monster art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature’s design features pixelated edges, stylized proportions, and a somewhat simplified yet detailed rendering of textures and forms—characteristics often seen in classic Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs), such as those from the *Final Fantasy* or *Dragon Quest* series. The use of bold outlines, limited color palette (with earthy tones), and the presence of a spherical orb at the creature’s feet resembling a 'monster egg' or 'capture capsule' further align with retro JRPG visual tropes. These elements suggest a deliberate homage to early digital monster designs, particularly from 16-bit era games. The overall composition resembles a bestiary entry from a fantasy RPG, reinforcing the retro aesthetic.",

      "question": "Does the creature's design visibly incorporate the temple's shape, textures, and mystical ambiance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature’s body is directly modeled after the pyramid temple, with its stepped tiers, stonework, and staircases forming the torso and back. Vegetation growing on the stone surfaces mirrors the overgrown, jungle-entwined appearance of real ancient ruins, enhancing the mystical ambiance. The texture of the stone blocks is consistent with aged masonry, and the surrounding misty jungle environment contributes to a sense of mystery and antiquity. The creature’s integration of these architectural and environmental details suggests a seamless fusion of temple and beast, making the temple’s form, texture, and atmosphere central to the creature’s identity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a custom-designed orb or capsule at the creature's feet, featuring patterns and colors that align with the temple's architectural details and natural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the base of the creature, there is a spherical object resembling a capsule or egg. It features intricate geometric patterns, including diamond shapes and stepped motifs reminiscent of Mesoamerican art and temple carvings. The color scheme includes earth tones (beige, brown, teal) and white, echoing the stone and foliage of the surrounding environment. The design of the orb incorporates symbolic elements like miniature temple silhouettes and tribal-like patterns, suggesting it is a thematic extension of the temple’s culture and aesthetic. This alignment between the orb’s design and the temple’s architectural style confirms it is a custom-designed element meant to reflect the setting.",

      "question": "Is the creature's invented name displayed beside or beneath it, along with its elemental type reflecting the temple's core characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Below the creature, there is text that includes a name written in both non-Latin script (possibly a fictional or stylized font) and Romanized characters: 'OM Framstie'. This appears to be an invented name for the creature. Beneath it, a line reads: 'Element type: wucilly the Temple wuld royp bue Chfaterterties.' While the text is partially obscured or intentionally distorted, it seems to reference the temple’s nature—likely intended to convey something like 'elemental type: temple-based' or 'temple essence.' Despite the garbled phrasing, the intent is clear: it describes the creature’s elemental affiliation tied to the temple’s core traits. This format mimics how fantasy creatures are described in bestiaries or game manuals, confirming the presence of both name and elemental classification.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artwork employs clean, defined lines with careful attention to detail in the creature’s stonework, foliage, and background. Shading is subtle and used effectively to create depth and volume without overwhelming the image. The overall layout—featuring the creature centrally, a descriptive label below, and a balanced composition—is typical of entries in a fantasy bestiary or monster guide. The muted color palette, hand-drawn feel, and inclusion of both artistic and textual information strongly resemble pages from a retro-styled fantasy encyclopedia, such as those seen in *Monster Manual* or *Dungeons & Dragons* lore books.",
