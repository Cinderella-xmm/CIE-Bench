      "question": "Is the entire heart-shaped board composed solely of LEGO bricks forming a mosaic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon visual inspection of Image B, the entire heart-shaped composition is constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks arranged in a mosaic pattern. There are no visible non-LEGO materials or elements within the structure. The surface is uniformly covered with LEGO bricks of various colors and sizes, forming a cohesive and continuous design that mimics the original food arrangement. This construction method is consistent with known LEGO art techniques where individual bricks are used to create detailed images. The absence of any gaps or non-brick materials supports the conclusion that the entire board is made solely of LEGO bricks.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks used to represent the food items colored appropriately to match the original produce (e.g., blue for blueberries, red for tomatoes)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks are carefully selected to match the natural colors of the corresponding food items. For example, blue LEGO bricks are used for blueberries, red bricks for strawberries and tomatoes, green for avocado and broccoli, and purple for the onion. This color matching aligns with real-world expectations of these foods' appearances. The use of yellow bricks for corn kernels and brown for mushrooms further demonstrates accurate color representation. This attention to color fidelity is typical in LEGO art aiming to replicate real-life objects realistically.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are different LEGO brick sizes and shapes used to simulate textures (e.g., smooth bricks for avocado, small round bricks for berries, larger chunky bricks for broccoli)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the LEGO mosaic employs varied brick sizes and shapes to simulate texture differences. For instance, the avocado is constructed using smooth, flat green bricks to mimic its smooth skin, while the interior uses lighter green and yellow bricks to represent the flesh. The blueberries are made from small round LEGO pieces, accurately replicating their spherical shape. Broccoli is built with smaller, irregular green bricks to simulate its florets, and the mushrooms use rounded white bricks to represent their caps. These choices reflect an understanding of how different brick types can convey texture and form, which is a hallmark of skilled LEGO artistry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all food items in the LEGO mosaic have clearly defined and distinct borders separating them from adjacent items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO mosaic shows most food items with clear boundaries, such as the separation between the avocado and the berries, or the tomato and the onion. However, some areas, like the transition between rice and chickpeas or near the ginger root, show overlapping or blended edges due to the pixelated nature of LEGO bricks. While the overall layout maintains recognizable separations, minor blending occurs where items meet closely. Therefore, not every item has a perfectly distinct border, but the majority do. Given the constraints of LEGO construction, this level of detail is reasonable, but it does not meet the standard of 'all' items having clearly defined borders.",

      "question": "Does the overall shape of the LEGO mosaic remain a perfect heart, matching the original boardâ€™s silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO mosaic in Image B is designed to follow the heart shape of the original wooden board from Image A. The outer edge of the LEGO construction precisely mirrors the curved contours of the heart, with no deviations or distortions. The symmetry and proportions are maintained, indicating careful planning and execution. This alignment suggests that the LEGO version was intentionally crafted to replicate the exact silhouette of the original heart-shaped board, preserving both form and aesthetic intent.",

      "question": "Is the LEGO mosaic placed on a solid, neutral gray base with no visible texture or pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO mosaic rests on a flat, uniform gray surface that appears smooth and featureless. There are no visible textures, patterns, or markings on the base, which serves as a neutral backdrop to highlight the colorful LEGO artwork. This type of presentation is common in product photography and LEGO displays to avoid distracting from the main subject. The base's clean, minimalist appearance supports the conclusion that it is indeed a solid, neutral gray platform without any added details.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the LEGO mosaic exhibit a clear pixelated, blocky appearance consistent with a LEGO construction, rather than a smooth or realistic rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO mosaic clearly displays a pixelated, blocky aesthetic characteristic of LEGO constructions. Each food item is composed of individual bricks that are visibly separate, creating a grid-like pattern. The edges of the items are jagged rather than smooth, and the surfaces have a distinct modular quality. This contrasts sharply with a photorealistic image, which would show continuous gradients and soft edges. The blockiness is especially noticeable in the avocado pit, the berry clusters, and the broccoli florets, all of which maintain the LEGO brick geometry. This appearance confirms that the image is a digital or physical LEGO creation, not a smooth rendering.",
