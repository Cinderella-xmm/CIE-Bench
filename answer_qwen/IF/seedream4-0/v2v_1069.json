      "question": "Is the ceiling fan enclosed within a transparent snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in focus is a small, decorative fan placed inside a transparent spherical enclosure resembling a snow globe. The fan is not a standard ceiling fan but rather a miniature, stylized version with a cartoonish face and design. It is clearly enclosed within the globe, which contains artificial snow at the base and snowflake patterns on the inner surface. This setup is fundamentally different from a ceiling fan, which is mounted to a ceiling and operates in open air. Therefore, while the fan is enclosed in a snow globe, it is not a ceiling fan. The question specifically asks if the 'ceiling fan' is enclosed â€” and since the object inside is not a ceiling fan, the answer must be 'No'.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe rest atop a tabletop under soft lighting with a warm and minimalist background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a snow globe placed on a clean, white tabletop. The lighting is soft and diffused, casting gentle highlights and shadows, contributing to a warm ambiance. The background is blurred but appears to consist of neutral-toned walls and furniture, consistent with a minimalist interior design. There are no cluttered elements or strong contrasts, reinforcing the minimalist aesthetic. The overall scene suggests a cozy, calm environment with carefully controlled lighting, which aligns with the description provided in the question.",

      "question": "Are there delicate shimmering effects visible on nearby surfaces caused by light passing through the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, there are subtle light reflections and refractions visible on the tabletop surrounding the snow globe. These appear as soft, scattered glimmers that resemble prismatic light effects, likely caused by the curvature of the glass globe refracting ambient light. Such effects are common when light passes through a transparent spherical object, especially under directional or warm lighting. The presence of these shimmering highlights indicates that light is interacting with the globe's surface in a way that creates visual sparkle on adjacent surfaces. This matches the description of 'delicate shimmering effects'.",

      "question": "Is the fan inside the snow globe depicted in a playful, cartoon-style 3D design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fan inside the snow globe features exaggerated, rounded shapes, a smiling face with eyes and a mouth, and pastel colors (light blue and beige). These characteristics are typical of cartoon or kawaii-style design. The blades are simplified and symmetrical, and the overall form lacks realistic mechanical details, suggesting it is intended for decorative or whimsical purposes rather than functional use. The 3D rendering style further enhances its playful appearance, with smooth surfaces and soft shading. This aligns with the definition of a playful, cartoon-style 3D design.",

      "question": "Are snowflakes visible drifting gently through the air inside the tiny room within the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the snow globe, there are small, white snowflake patterns etched or printed on the inner surface of the glass, but they are static and not moving. Additionally, there is artificial snow at the base, but no visible particles floating or drifting in mid-air. While the scene evokes a snowy atmosphere, there is no indication of actual motion of snowflakes within the space. The 'tiny room' inside the globe appears to be a reflection of the surrounding environment, possibly due to internal reflections or a backdrop image, but no snowflakes are actively falling or drifting. Therefore, despite the winter theme, the snowflakes are not shown in motion.",
