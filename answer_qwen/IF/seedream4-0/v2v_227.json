      "question": "Does the motorcycle and truck appear in a simplified, cartoon-like version with a cute aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle and truck are rendered in a highly stylized manner. The lines are clean and bold, with simplified shapes and minimal detail compared to real-world vehicles. The colors are flat and vibrant, typical of cartoon illustrations. The overall design lacks realistic textures and shadows, emphasizing a playful and simplified visual style. Additionally, the truck has a smiling face drawn on its windshield, which adds a 'cute' or anthropomorphic quality. These characteristics align with a cartoon-like, cute aesthetic commonly seen in stickers or children's media.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the key features—the red sport motorcycle, the rider dressed in black gear, and the blue vintage truck—retained in the sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red sport motorcycle is clearly visible in Image B, maintaining its central role in the composition. The rider is depicted wearing black gear, including a helmet, jacket, and boots, consistent with the original image’s depiction. The blue vintage truck is also present, retaining its distinct shape and color. While the details are simplified, all three core elements—the red motorcycle, the rider, and the blue truck—are identifiable and preserved in the sticker form. This retention ensures continuity of the main subjects despite the stylistic change.",

      "question": "Do the vehicles and rider include playful touches such as exaggerated proportions or expressive characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the sticker includes several playful design choices. The truck has a smiling face with eyes and rosy cheeks drawn on its windshield, giving it an expressive, personified appearance. The proportions of the vehicles are slightly exaggerated—such as the oversized wheels and simplified body shapes—to enhance their cartoonish appeal. The rider, while still recognizable, has a simplified facial expression with a small smile, contributing to the lighthearted tone. These elements collectively suggest a deliberate use of expressive and exaggerated features for humor and charm.",

      "question": "Is there a thick white outline around the sticker design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the entire sticker is surrounded by a prominent white border that separates it from the transparent background. This outline is consistent in thickness and appears to be a standard feature of sticker designs, intended to give the image a cut-out look. It enhances the perception of the sticker as a physical object that could be applied to surfaces. This is a common design choice in digital stickers and decals.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a solid flat color circular base with the motorcycle or truck extending beyond it for a dynamic effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a large red circular base beneath both the motorcycle and the truck. This base is uniformly colored and flat, serving as a platform or ground element. Both vehicles extend beyond the edges of this circle, particularly the front wheel of the motorcycle and the rear of the truck, creating a sense of motion and dynamism. This design choice gives the impression that the vehicles are emerging from or moving across the base, enhancing the visual impact and energy of the sticker.",

      "question": "Is the background of the sticker transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is not a solid color but instead consists of a checkerboard pattern, which is a standard visual indicator of transparency in digital graphics. This pattern is commonly used in image editing software to represent areas without a background, allowing the sticker to be placed on various surfaces without a fixed backdrop. Therefore, the transparency is intentional and functional for sticker applications.",
