      "question": "Has the black handbag been transformed into a human-like female model with a defined body, posture, and facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual content clearly shows a human female model walking on a runway. She has distinct facial features, a defined body structure, and is posed in a confident stance typical of fashion modeling. The model's appearance is entirely anthropomorphic, with no visible transformation from an object like a handbag. While the design elements of the dress (such as the MK logo) may echo features of the handbag, the model herself is not a literal transformation of the bag but rather a separate entity. This conclusion is based on direct observation of human anatomy and facial features present in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the model wear a black dress that replicates the pebbled leather texture and curved silhouette of the original handbag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model in Image B is wearing a sleek, black, form-fitting dress made of a smooth, glossy material that resembles leather. However, the texture appears to be smooth and reflective rather than pebbled, which is a key feature of the handbag in Image A. Additionally, while the silhouette of the dress is elegant and structured, it does not replicate the curved, hobo-style shape of the handbag. Instead, the dress follows a more traditional mermaid or column silhouette. Therefore, although there are thematic similarities (e.g., color, brand logo), the texture and overall shape do not match the handbag’s design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the model wearing gold jewelry (e.g., earrings, necklace, bracelet) that matches the gold hardware of the original handbag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model is adorned with multiple pieces of gold jewelry: a chunky chain necklace, matching earrings, and bracelets on both wrists. These accessories are consistent in style and color with the gold hardware seen on the handbag in Image A, such as the zippers, buckles, and the MK logo charm. The use of gold complements the luxury aesthetic of the Michael Kors brand and aligns with the metallic accents found on the original handbag. This suggests a deliberate stylistic continuity between the accessories and the bag’s hardware.",

      "question": "Is the MK logo displayed as a circular gold brooch attached to the model’s dress or jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model in Image B has a prominent circular gold MK logo affixed to the side of her dress, near the hip area. It is styled as a brooch or decorative element, similar to the MK charm hanging from the handbag in Image A. The placement and design are consistent with branding strategies used by Michael Kors, where the logo is featured as a statement accessory. This visual cue directly mirrors the iconic MK emblem seen on the handbag, reinforcing brand identity across products and fashion presentations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, the phrase 'Strut the City Streets' is clearly visible. The font used is a clean, elegant serif typeface, which contributes to a sophisticated and fashionable tone. Serif fonts are commonly used in high-end fashion advertising to convey elegance and timelessness. The placement and styling of the text suggest it is part of a promotional campaign, aligning with the luxurious context of the runway setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B depicts a long, well-lit runway flanked by rows of seated spectators. Among them, several individuals are holding cameras, clearly capturing the model’s walk. The setting includes ornate architectural details such as columns and chandeliers, indicative of a high-end fashion show venue. This environment is consistent with luxury fashion runways, where professional photographers are typically present to document the event. The presence of photographers and the formal setup confirm this as a professional runway presentation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a vertical orientation, with the height significantly exceeding the width. This tall, narrow format is typical for fashion editorial or social media content designed to emphasize the full length of the model and the garment. The composition draws attention upward along the runway, enhancing the dramatic effect of the model’s stride. This aspect ratio is common in digital fashion campaigns and magazine layouts, particularly when showcasing full-body shots on runways.",
