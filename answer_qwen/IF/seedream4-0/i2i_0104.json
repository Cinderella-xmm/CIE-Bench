      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image features a close-up of an orange tabby kitten lying on a green textured surface, which is visually appealing and commonly used in pet adoption materials to evoke empathy. The addition of text—'Warm Home' at the top and 'Adopt Love' at the bottom—suggests a persuasive message typical of adoption campaigns. These textual elements are styled in a way that complements the emotional appeal of the kitten’s expression and pose. In real-world contexts, pet adoption posters often include such imagery paired with emotionally resonant phrases to encourage viewers to adopt. Given these visual cues and their alignment with common design practices for adoption promotions, it is reasonable to conclude that the image is formatted as a pet adoption poster.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the edited image (Image B), the phrase 'Warm Home' is clearly visible in white, bold, sans-serif font positioned at the top center of the image. This text is not present in the original image (Image A), as confirmed by comparing both images. The presence of this text aligns with typical graphic design practices where messages are overlaid to convey a specific theme or call to action. Since the text appears in Image B but not in Image A, it can be concluded that 'Warm Home' has been added.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phrase 'Adopt Love' is displayed in a cursive, handwritten-style font at the bottom center of the image. This text is absent in Image A, indicating that it was added during the editing process. The placement and style of this text suggest it is part of a thematic message encouraging adoption. Based on the comparison between the two images and the absence of this text in the original, it is evident that 'Adopt Love' has been added.",

      "question": "Are both \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\" clearly visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both texts, 'Warm Home' and 'Adopt Love', are present in Image B. 'Warm Home' is located at the top in a large, bold, white font that contrasts well with the darker background, making it highly legible. 'Adopt Love' is positioned at the bottom in a stylized cursive font, also in white, which stands out against the green carpet. Neither text overlaps significantly with the cat’s features or other elements in a way that obscures readability. Therefore, both phrases are clearly visible and readable, fulfilling the criteria for effective messaging in a poster format.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat occupies the central portion of the image, with its face and front paws prominently displayed. The lighting emphasizes the cat’s facial features, particularly its eyes, which draw immediate attention. Although text has been added, it is placed at the top and bottom edges of the image, framing the cat without obstructing its visibility. The composition maintains the cat as the primary subject, consistent with typical pet adoption imagery where the animal is the focal point to elicit emotional engagement. Even with the added text, the cat remains the dominant visual element.",
