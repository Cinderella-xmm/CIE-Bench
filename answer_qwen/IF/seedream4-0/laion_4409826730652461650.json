      "question": "Is the plush horse depicted in a cartoon style with bold outlines and vibrant colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush horse is illustrated in a stylized, animated manner typical of cartoons. It features exaggerated facial expressions, simplified shapes, and uses bold black outlines around its form, which are hallmarks of cartoon art. The colors are vivid—such as the bright yellow eyes, rich brown fur, and white patches—further emphasizing a vibrant palette. These visual cues align with common characteristics of cartoon illustrations, where clarity and expressiveness are prioritized over realism.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 1 of Image B depicts a desert-like environment consistent with a Western theme. There is a visible dirt road stretching into the distance, characteristic of a dusty trail. Additionally, multiple green cacti are clearly present on both sides of the road, reinforcing the arid, southwestern setting. These elements are typical of classic Western or frontier scenes and are rendered in a cartoonish style that matches the overall aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the horse in Panel 1 looking into the distance with a determined facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1, the horse is shown facing slightly to the left, with its gaze directed forward toward the horizon. Its eyebrows are angled downward, and its mouth is set in a firm line, conveying a sense of resolve or determination. This facial expression, combined with the posture of walking purposefully down the road, suggests a focused and resolute demeanor. Such an expression is commonly used in cartoons to indicate intent or readiness for action.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2, the horse has a wide, cheerful smile with visible teeth, indicating confidence and joy. Above its head, a rope is shaped into a loop, resembling a lasso being twirled, though it is not actively moving. The positioning of the lasso suggests motion, implying that the horse is performing a lasso trick. This dynamic pose, combined with the expressive face, supports the interpretation that the horse is confidently showcasing a cowboy skill.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 displays a detailed Western town setting. The background includes several wooden structures with features typical of old American frontier towns, such as porches, signs (e.g., 'SALOON'), and weathered wood textures. These buildings resemble saloons and general stores commonly seen in Western-themed cartoons. The presence of these architectural elements confirms a village backdrop consistent with a Wild West environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the very top of Image B, there is a prominent title in large, bold, yellow font with a red outline that reads 'Wild, Wild Horse Adventures!'. This text is centered and spans the width of the image, serving as a header for the cartoon strip. Its placement and design suggest it is the title of the story or series, matching the content and theme of the panels below.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is structured with two distinct horizontal panels stacked vertically, separated by a thin white line. Each panel contains a scene with the same character (the plush horse) in different poses and settings, following a narrative sequence. This layout is characteristic of a comic strip format, specifically a two-panel setup, commonly used in sequential storytelling. The presence of a title above both panels further supports this structure.",
