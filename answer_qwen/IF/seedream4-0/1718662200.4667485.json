      "question": "Is the pig rendered in a cartoon style with exaggerated features and bright colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pig in Image B is depicted with stylized, rounded features such as large ears, a prominent snout, and a cheerful expression, which are typical of cartoon art. The use of bright, saturated colors—like the vivid red shirt, green sunglasses, and colorful background—further supports the cartoon aesthetic. Additionally, the overall composition includes whimsical elements like floating soundwaves and speech bubbles, reinforcing the playful, animated style. This contrasts with more realistic depictions that would emphasize anatomical accuracy and natural color tones. Therefore, based on visual cues such as exaggerated proportions, vibrant palette, and stylistic elements, it is clear that the pig is rendered in a cartoon style.",

      "question": "Does the pig have a significantly larger head compared to its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig's head is proportionally large relative to its body, especially noticeable in the top panel where the head dominates the frame. This exaggeration of the head size is a common technique in cartoon art to emphasize facial expressions and add charm or humor. While the body is visible and proportionate within the cartoon context, the head appears disproportionately large when compared to standard animal anatomy. This is consistent with the exaggerated style seen in many animated characters. In contrast, a realistic depiction would maintain more balanced proportions between head and body. Thus, the visual evidence supports that the pig has a significantly larger head compared to its body.",

      "question": "Is the pig wearing green sunglasses while DJing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig in the top panel is clearly wearing green-tinted round sunglasses while operating a DJ turntable. The color of the lenses is distinctly green, and they match the cartoonish, vibrant aesthetic of the image. Although there are other pigs in the lower panels wearing different colored sunglasses (e.g., red), the central figure performing the DJ role is specifically wearing green ones. This detail is consistent across the top section of the image, where the pig is shown behind the DJ equipment. Therefore, based on direct visual observation, the pig DJ is indeed wearing green sunglasses.",

      "question": "Is the background a disco-themed watercolor painting with soft, blended colors and visible texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B exhibits characteristics of a watercolor painting, including soft, blended hues, visible brushstroke textures, and translucent color washes. These elements are particularly evident in the gradient patterns and abstract shapes surrounding the pig. The inclusion of colorful soundwave motifs and bokeh-like light effects enhances the disco theme, suggesting a lively, musical atmosphere. The overall style is not digital or photorealistic but rather artistic and expressive, consistent with watercolor techniques. Thus, combining visual cues such as color blending, texture, and thematic elements, the background can be accurately described as a disco-themed watercolor painting.",

      "question": "Are there blank chat bubbles present in the image, each framed by vivid soundwave patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains multiple white speech bubbles, each positioned near the pigs and associated with their actions. These bubbles are empty (blank) and are surrounded by colorful soundwave patterns that resemble audio waveforms. The soundwaves vary in color and intensity, matching the energetic, musical theme of the scene. For example, the top bubble is framed by a rainbow-colored soundwave, while others have blue or pink waves. This design choice links dialogue or music to the characters' actions, enhancing the comic book or illustrated storybook feel. The presence of both blank speech bubbles and surrounding soundwave patterns is visually confirmed throughout the image, supporting the description.",
