      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall visual style of the image transformed into a whimsical, storybook-like illustration rather than a realistic photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image displays a highly stylized and colorful scene that is clearly not a photograph. The lighting is soft and diffused, with exaggerated highlights and shadows typical of animated illustrations. The background features a lush forest with vibrant greenery, a winding path, and flowers rendered in a painterly, cartoonish style. The tart itself has a smooth, almost glowing surface with a cheerful face drawn on it, which is inconsistent with real-world physics and textures. These elements collectively indicate a deliberate artistic transformation into a whimsical, storybook-like illustration, distinct from the realistic photographic style seen in typical food photography.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are bright eyes and a warm smile visibly present on the yellow surface of the front tart, giving it a cheerful, anthropomorphic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the front tart in the image, two large, round, dark eyes with highlights are clearly visible on the yellow surface, along with a small, curved line forming a smile beneath them. These features are stylized and cartoonish, designed to give the tart a friendly, animated expression. This anthropomorphism is a common technique in whimsical illustrations to evoke emotion and charm, and it is distinctly present here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are tiny, animated forest creatures visible along the crust rim of the front tart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Along the edge of the tart's crust, several small animals are perched, including what appear to be rabbits, squirrels, and possibly a mouse or chipmunk. These creatures are stylized with exaggerated features and soft colors, consistent with an animated or illustrated style. Their placement around the tart suggests they are interacting with it, enhancing the magical, storybook feel of the scene. These details confirm the presence of animated forest creatures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible, gently swirling path extending from the tarts into a forest setting in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a light-colored, curving path that begins near the base of the tart and winds into the distance through a dense forest. The path has a gentle, spiral-like design, contributing to the dreamy and inviting atmosphere. It is clearly visible and integrates seamlessly into the background, suggesting a journey or adventure theme. This path is a key element of the whimsical landscape, reinforcing the storybook aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are green foliage and pastel-colored flowers present around the tart, contributing to a dreamy forest atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surrounding environment is rich with green leaves, vines, and various types of plants. Scattered throughout are delicate flowers in pastel shades such as pink, white, and purple, which add softness and color contrast to the scene. These botanical elements are rendered in a stylized manner, typical of fantasy or childrenâ€™s book illustrations. Together, they create a serene, enchanted forest ambiance that complements the whimsical nature of the tart.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the original \"PABLO\" logo been either removed or creatively integrated into the whimsical illustration (e.g., as part of a tree or sign) to maintain thematic consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the original image (Image A), the 'PABLO' logo is clearly visible on the surface of the tart. However, in Image B, this logo is absent. Instead, the tart features a smiling face and animated creatures, fully embracing the whimsical theme. There is no indication of the logo being reworked into a tree, sign, or any other element within the scene. Its complete removal aligns with the transformation into a fantasy-style illustration where branding is replaced by narrative and emotional appeal. Therefore, the logo has been removed rather than integrated.",
