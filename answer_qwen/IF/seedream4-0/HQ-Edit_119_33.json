      "question": "Does the image display a consistent Art Nouveau style characterized by flowing lines, organic forms, and decorative elegance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image features several visual elements that align with the Art Nouveau style. These include swirling, curvilinear patterns in the background, stylized floral motifs, and an emphasis on organic, flowing lines. The sunflowers are not depicted realistically but rather as ornamental designs with spirals and symmetrical patterns. The border framing the image also incorporates intricate, curling lines typical of Art Nouveau decoration. The overall composition is highly decorative, avoiding sharp angles and emphasizing fluidity and natural forms—hallmarks of the Art Nouveau movement. This stylistic consistency across multiple elements supports the conclusion that the image embodies the Art Nouveau aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are the sunflowers depicted with stylized geometric patterns and flowing, organic lines instead of realistic botanical details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunflowers are clearly rendered in a non-realistic manner. Their petals and centers feature geometric shapes such as concentric circles and spiral patterns, which are not found in real sunflowers. The outlines of the flowers are smooth and stylized, with exaggerated symmetry and decorative flourishes. These characteristics reflect a departure from botanical accuracy and instead emphasize artistic abstraction and ornamentation. This aligns with the Art Nouveau tendency to use nature as inspiration while transforming it into idealized, flowing forms. Thus, the depiction is stylized rather than realistic.",

      "question": "Has the braided hairstyle been replaced with swirling, ornamental motifs characteristic of Art Nouveau art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The braided hairstyle in Image B retains its original form as a series of tight, rounded braids. However, these braids are enhanced with decorative elements such as stylized sunflowers and golden accents that integrate with the overall Art Nouveau theme. While the hair itself is not replaced with abstract swirls or purely ornamental motifs, the styling includes decorative embellishments that harmonize with the Art Nouveau aesthetic. Therefore, the hairstyle has not been completely replaced but rather artistically augmented to fit the style. Given that the core structure remains braided, the answer is no—the hairstyle has not been replaced, only stylized.",

      "question": "Is the dress redesigned with swirling, fluid patterns and decorative flourishes typical of Art Nouveau fashion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B has been significantly altered from a simple garment into a decorative piece featuring prominent swirling patterns and ornamental flourishes. The fabric appears to be adorned with large spiral motifs, particularly on the chest area, which are reminiscent of Art Nouveau design elements. The draping and folds of the dress are accentuated with flowing lines that mirror the organic curves seen throughout the artwork. These changes transform the dress from a functional garment into a decorative element that complements the overall Art Nouveau style. Hence, the redesign incorporates key stylistic traits of the era.",

      "question": "Is the sunflower field depicted as a tapestry of intricate, curling lines and soft curves, rather than a realistic landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B does not represent a realistic sunflower field. Instead, it is composed of stylized sunflowers arranged in a patterned, almost mosaic-like fashion. The plants and flowers are outlined with fine, curling lines and filled with repetitive geometric and spiral designs. The entire scene functions more like a decorative tapestry than a natural landscape. This transformation into a patterned, flowing composition aligns with the Art Nouveau approach of using nature as a basis for elaborate ornamentation. Therefore, the depiction is indeed a stylized tapestry of soft curves and intricate lines.",
