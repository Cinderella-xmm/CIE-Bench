      "question": "Is the woman's head significantly larger than her body, consistent with a cartoon-style character design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a stylized, cartoon-like form. The head is proportionally larger compared to the body, which is a common characteristic in cartoon or emoji-style designs where facial features are emphasized for expressiveness. This exaggeration of head size relative to the body is typical in simplified or playful character illustrations, especially in rubber keychains or toys. This visual cue, combined with the exaggerated facial features and simplified limbs, supports the conclusion that the character follows a cartoon-style aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are the red boots clearly visible and unchanged in color and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red boots are prominently displayed and retain their original bright red color and shape from the source image. The boots are positioned on the character’s feet and maintain their distinct form, including the buckle detail and overall silhouette. There is no visible alteration in color saturation or structural deformation, indicating that they have been preserved accurately in the stylized representation. This consistency suggests that the boots were intentionally kept as a recognizable feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the character have bold black outlines surrounding its entire form, suggesting a soft rubber toy aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is outlined with a thick, continuous black border that defines its edges sharply against the background. This bold outlining is characteristic of rubber keychains or soft vinyl toys, where such outlines enhance visual contrast and durability. The black border also gives the character a flat, two-dimensional appearance typical of mass-produced novelty items. This stylistic choice aligns with common design practices for rubber toys and keychains, reinforcing the perception of a manufactured, cartoonish object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the character depicted in an exaggerated bending-over pose, with her torso angled downward toward her legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is shown in a bent-over posture, with the upper body leaning forward and the hands reaching down toward the ankles. This pose mimics the dynamic stance seen in the original image but is exaggerated in scale and angularity, emphasizing the curvature of the spine and the positioning of the arms. Such an exaggerated pose is common in stylized illustrations to convey motion or attitude, and it aligns with the playful, caricatured nature of the keychain design.",

      "question": "Is a silver-colored metal keyring visibly attached to the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the character in Image B, a circular silver-colored metal keyring is clearly visible, connected via a small chain to the character's head. This component is typical of keychains and serves both functional and aesthetic purposes. The metallic sheen and ring structure are consistent with standard hardware used in such products, confirming its presence and purpose as part of the item.",

      "question": "Is the background composed of neutral-toned wooden planks, without any elements of water, sky, or boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of horizontally aligned wooden planks with a light beige or tan tone, resembling a deck or tabletop surface. There are no visible elements such as water, sky, or a boat, which were present in the original outdoor setting (Image A). The absence of these environmental details indicates that the character has been isolated and placed on a simple, neutral backdrop—common in product photography to highlight the item without distraction.",
