    "explanation": "The typography used for 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' is clean, modern, and uncluttered—characteristics of a minimalist design. The font is sans-serif, which enhances legibility and conveys simplicity. The white color contrasts well against the darker background and the rich red of the apples, making the text stand out without overwhelming the image. Minimalist branding often relies on such clear, direct messaging with limited visual noise.

    "Question": "Q4: Have the original visual elements, such as the apples and their setting, remained unchanged apart from the added text?",
    "explanation": "By comparing Image A and Image B, the apples, their positioning, lighting, texture, and the wooden surface beneath them appear identical. The background, including the blurred green foliage and window light, also remains consistent. The only difference between the two images is the addition of the words 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' in Image B. No alterations to the apples’ appearance, shadows, or environment are evident. Therefore, the core visual elements have been preserved.",

There are no changes in color grading, lighting, composition, or object placement. The apples, table, background, and depth of field remain exactly the same. Thus, no other edits—such as filters, cropping, or digital enhancements—are detectable beyond the textual additions.",
