        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite in Image B is depicted with clean, geometric lines and a simple diamond shape, which is a common form for traditional kites and paper crafts. Its edges are sharply defined, and the red stitching-like lines along the frame suggest structural support typical of handmade kites. The tail is long and ribbon-like, consistent with materials used in paper crafts such as paper strips or ribbons. Additionally, the overall aesthetic is flat and stylized, lacking complex textures or 3D depth, which aligns with how paper models are often illustrated. This visual simplicity and clarity strongly suggest that the kite could be replicated as a paper craft model. The surrounding decorative elements—such as cut-out paper flowers and lanterns—further reinforce the idea of a crafted, artistic presentation, indicating that the kite is designed to be part of a craft-oriented scene.",

      "question": "Are the colors used for the kite vibrant and suitable for representing cultural significance on a postcard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite in Image B is bright yellow with red accents along its frame, which are both vibrant and culturally significant colors, especially in East Asian traditions. Yellow symbolizes prosperity and joy, while red represents good fortune, happiness, and celebration—common themes in festivals like Chinese New Year. These colors are frequently used in cultural decorations and festive art, making them ideal for a postcard intended to convey cultural richness. Furthermore, the surrounding elements—red paper lanterns, intricate red and gold cut-outs—reinforce this cultural context, suggesting a festive, celebratory theme. The contrast between the yellow kite and the blue sky enhances visibility and visual appeal, which is important for postcards aiming to capture attention and evoke emotion. Thus, the color scheme is not only vibrant but also culturally resonant.",

      "question": "Is the kite prominently featured in the image, with minimal distracting elements around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the kite is centrally positioned and clearly visible in Image B, it is surrounded by numerous decorative elements such as red paper lanterns, cut-out floral patterns, and ornamental borders. These elements, though aesthetically pleasing and thematically consistent, do occupy significant space around the kite and draw visual attention away from it. The frame-like structure of the image, with these embellishments placed at the corners and edges, creates a border effect that frames the kite rather than allowing it to stand alone. As a result, the kite is not isolated or presented in a minimalist way; instead, it is integrated into a richly decorated composition. Therefore, while the kite remains the focal point due to its central placement and bright color, the abundance of surrounding details introduces distractions that reduce its prominence relative to the overall composition.",

      "question": "Are the structural details of the kite, such as its frame and tail, well-defined and clear enough to suggest it could be crafted from paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite in Image B displays clear structural features: the red lines forming an 'X' across the kite indicate a classic cross-frame design, commonly found in traditional kites and easily replicable in paper crafts. These lines are sharp and distinct, suggesting they represent the spine and cross-spine of the kite’s skeleton. The tail is long, smooth, and ribbon-like, consistent with paper or fabric strips used in crafting. The edges of the kite are clean and angular, reinforcing the impression of a flat, layered construction. Moreover, the overall style is simplified and two-dimensional, aligning with how paper models are typically represented. The lack of shading or texture further supports the idea that it is meant to be interpreted as a flat, handcrafted object. Given these visual cues and their alignment with real-world paper kite designs, the structural details are sufficiently clear to suggest paper craft feasibility.",
