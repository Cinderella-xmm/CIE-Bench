    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire forest lake scene enclosed within a visible spherical glass orb?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a large transparent spherical glass orb is clearly visible in the foreground. The orb contains a miniature version of the forest lake scene, including water, rocks, plants, and small animal figurines. The background shows the same forest and lake landscape, but it is outside the orb, suggesting that only the portion inside the orb is enclosed. The reflection and refraction effects on the sphere's surface confirm it is made of glass or a similar transparent material. The scene inside the orb is distinct from the real-world environment behind it, indicating that the entire forest lake scene within the orb is enclosed. However, the full-scale forest lake scene in the background remains outside the orb. Therefore, only the miniature version is enclosed, not the entire original scene.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Have the ducks been replaced with 3D models that have a glossy, reflective surface finish?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ducks inside the glass orb are small, brightly colored, and appear to be artificial objects rather than real birds. Their surfaces are smooth and highly reflective, with sharp highlights and uniform coloration typical of plastic or resin materials. This contrasts with natural ducks, which have textured feathers and matte or semi-gloss finishes. The reflections and lighting on these duck figures suggest they are 3D models designed for visual appeal, likely used as decorative elements in the terrarium-like setup. These characteristics align with common features of toy or model ducks, especially those found in miniature dioramas or snow globes. Therefore, based on their appearance and context, they are indeed 3D models with a glossy, reflective surface finish.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the water feature layered resin-like textures and transparent materials that enhance depth and clarity?",
    "explanation": "The water inside the glass orb in Image B exhibits a high degree of transparency and clarity, with visible layers beneath the surface such as pebbles, plant life, and figurines. The water appears to have a smooth, glassy texture consistent with layered resin or high-clarity liquid used in decorative displays. There are subtle variations in color and refractive qualities that suggest multiple layers, possibly mimicking natural stratification. Such effects are commonly achieved using clear resin or carefully layered liquids in dioramas to create depth and visual interest. The way light passes through and bends around objects within the water supports the idea of a manufactured, transparent material designed to simulate natural water while enhancing clarity and depth. Thus, the water does feature layered, resin-like textures and transparent materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are there visible miniature figurines of woodland animals placed among the rocks and vegetation?",
    "explanation": "Inside the glass orb in Image B, several small figurines can be seen positioned among the rocks and greenery. These include what appear to be a fox, a deer, and possibly other small mammals. They are stylized and not realistic in scale or detail, indicating they are miniature models rather than real animals. Their placement among the rocks and plants suggests intentional arrangement to create a naturalistic scene within the diorama. These types of figurines are commonly used in terrariums or decorative globes to represent wildlife. Given their size, shape, and positioning, they are clearly identifiable as miniature woodland animal figurines.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the glass orb resting on a natural wood base with visible organic textures such as grain or bark?",
    "explanation": "The glass orb in Image B is placed on a circular wooden platform that resembles a tree stump or cross-section of a log. The surface shows clear wood grain patterns, knots, and rough edges consistent with natural wood. The texture includes bark remnants and uneven surfaces, indicating it was cut from a real tree trunk. This type of base is often used in rustic or nature-themed decor to provide an organic contrast to the smooth glass orb. The presence of these natural textures—such as grain lines and bark—confirms that the base is made of natural wood with visible organic features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
