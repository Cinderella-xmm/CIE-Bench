      "question": "Is there a 3D chibi-style figure emerging from the kayak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small, stylized character with exaggerated features—such as large eyes, a round head, and simplified limbs—is visible inside the yellow kayak. This character has a cartoonish, chibi aesthetic commonly seen in anime or toy figurines. The figure is holding a paddle and appears to be seated within the kayak, suggesting it is part of the scene. Based on visual cues such as its proportions relative to the kayak and its three-dimensional rendering (with shading and depth), it can be determined that this is a 3D chibi-style figure. The figure does not appear to be flat or drawn but rather modeled with volume and perspective, consistent with 3D digital art.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure appear to be crossing the kayak’s edge and stepping into the real-world environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figure is positioned entirely within the confines of the kayak. Its feet are placed on the seat or floor of the kayak, and there is no visual indication that any part of the figure extends beyond the kayak’s edge into the surrounding space. The figure is clearly contained within the kayak’s interior, and there is no overlap or interaction with the external environment. Therefore, based on the spatial arrangement and visual boundaries, the figure is not stepping out into the real-world environment.",

      "question": "Is the scene framed within a Polaroid photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a rectangular image with a white border around the central content, which is characteristic of a Polaroid photograph. The edges of the image are slightly curved, and the overall composition mimics the appearance of a physical instant photo. Additionally, the background outside the frame is blurred and neutral, further reinforcing the impression that the scene is contained within a photograph. This framing technique is consistent with how Polaroid photos are typically presented, especially in digital renderings or artistic compositions.",

      "question": "Is the Polaroid photograph being held by a human hand in the overall composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom left corner of Image B, a human hand is visible, gripping the lower edge of the Polaroid photograph. The fingers and thumb are clearly rendered with natural skin tone and texture, and their positioning suggests they are holding the photo steady. This detail adds a layer of realism to the composition, indicating that the viewer is seeing a photograph being physically held. The presence of the hand is consistent with common photographic presentation styles in visual media.",

      "question": "Are the original kayak and skateboard still present and recognizable in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kayak and skateboard from the original image (Image A) are both present in Image B. The yellow kayak is positioned on the left side of the Polaroid frame, and the skateboard is on the right. Both objects retain their original shapes, colors, and details—such as the black seat in the kayak and the brown wheels on the skateboard. Although the kayak now contains a chibi figure, the kayak itself remains visually identical to the one in Image A. Similarly, the skateboard has not been altered in form or color. Thus, despite the addition of the figure and the Polaroid framing, the original objects are still clearly recognizable.",
