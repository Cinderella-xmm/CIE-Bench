      "question": "Is the Statue of Liberty fully enclosed within a vintage-style glass lantern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Statue of Liberty is depicted as a miniature model placed inside a glass lantern. The lantern has a clear glass body, copper-colored metal frame, and a handle on top, consistent with a vintage-style design. The entire statue, including its pedestal, is contained within the glass enclosure. This visual evidence confirms that the statue is fully enclosed. The structure of the lantern, with its transparent glass and protective metal casing, supports the conclusion that it functions as a display case for the diorama.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the Statue of Liberty display both verdigris (greenish-blue) and copper-hued (reddish-brown) patinas on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Statue of Liberty in Image B shows a dual-tone appearance. The upper portion of the statue, particularly the head, torch, and parts of the robe, exhibits a greenish-blue color characteristic of verdigris, which forms naturally on copper over time due to oxidation. The lower sections of the statue, especially near the base and certain folds of the robe, show reddish-brown tones typical of aged copper. This combination reflects the real-world patina development of the actual Statue of Liberty, where copper oxidizes into a green patina while some areas retain original copper hues. The artistic rendering accurately captures this transition.",

      "question": "Is the background sky rendered in soft pastel colors such as pale pink, lavender, or mint green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background behind the lantern in Image B features a blurred cityscape with buildings in muted tones. The sky above these structures is not distinctly colored but appears as a neutral, light beige or off-white gradient. There are no visible pastel hues like pale pink, lavender, or mint green in the sky itself. Instead, the softness comes from the out-of-focus cityscape and lighting, not from pastel-colored sky tones. Therefore, the sky does not meet the criteria of being rendered in soft pastel colors.",

      "question": "Are there tiny ships and wave patterns visible beneath the Statue of Liberty in the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the glass lantern in Image B, beneath the miniature Statue of Liberty, there is a detailed representation of water with wave patterns. Three small ships—two sailing vessels and one smaller boat—are clearly visible on the water surface. These elements are part of the diorama's base, designed to simulate the harbor setting around the Statue of Liberty. The inclusion of ships and waves enhances the realism of the scene, indicating a deliberate artistic choice to include maritime details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a visible revolving mechanism (e.g., rotating base, gears, or central axis) at the foundation of the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the base of the lantern in Image B, a mechanical component is visible beneath the glass. It includes a central axis connected to a small crank or lever extending outward, suggesting a manual rotation feature. This mechanism appears to be part of a rotating base system, allowing the diorama to spin when the crank is turned. Such mechanisms are common in decorative lanterns or dioramas to allow 360-degree viewing. The presence of gears and a central pivot supports the inference that this is a functional revolving mechanism.",

      "question": "Does the diorama maintain the recognizable grandeur and detailed features of the Statue of Liberty despite being miniature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the Statue of Liberty in Image B is scaled down, it retains key identifiable features such as the raised torch, crown with spikes, tablet in hand, flowing robes, and overall posture. The proportions and iconic silhouette are preserved, making it instantly recognizable. The attention to detail in the facial expression, drapery folds, and pedestal architecture reflects a high level of craftsmanship. Even in miniature form, the diorama captures the symbolic grandeur of the original monument, ensuring its cultural and aesthetic significance remains intact.",
