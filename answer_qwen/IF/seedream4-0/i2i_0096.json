      "question": "Does the edited image show a left-side 90-degree view of the sofa alongside the front view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa is depicted in a way that shows both its front and left side simultaneously. The perspective reveals the full depth of the sofa, including the armrest and backrest on the left side, which indicates a three-quarter view rather than a strict 90-degree side view. A true 90-degree side view would show only the profile of the sofa without any visible front cushioning or depth from the front. However, here we see both the front cushions and the left armrest and backrest, suggesting a diagonal or angled view that combines elements of both front and side perspectives. This is consistent with a typical interior rendering where the camera angle is adjusted to capture spatial depth while maintaining visibility of key design features. Therefore, it's not a pure 90-degree left-side view but rather a composite angled view.",

      "question": "Are the dimensions of the sofa consistent between the front and left-side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, the sofa appears as an L-shaped sectional with a straight front section and a perpendicular left extension. The proportions of the cushions, armrests, and overall structure appear uniform and aligned with standard furniture design principles. The depth of the left section matches the depth of the front section, and the height of the backrest remains consistent across both parts. There are no visual distortions such as stretching or shrinking that would suggest inconsistency in scaling. Additionally, the symmetry and alignment of the cushions and frame support the idea that the dimensions are maintained consistently. In real-world furniture design, such consistency is crucial for structural integrity and aesthetic harmony, and this image adheres to those expectations.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the front and side views of the sofa smooth and coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition between the front and left-side sections of the sofa in Image B is seamless. The corner where the two sections meet is well-defined, with clean lines and matching fabric texture. The cushions align properly at the joint, and there is no visible gap or misalignment that would disrupt the visual flow. The continuity of the armrests, backrests, and seat cushions suggests careful design planning. In architectural and interior visualization, smooth transitions are essential for realism and comfort. The absence of any abrupt changes or visual artifacts confirms that the transition is coherent and professionally rendered.",

      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the sofa consistent in both the front and side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears to originate from a large window on the left side, casting soft, natural light across the room. This is evident from the bright patches on the wall and floor near the window, as well as the subtle highlights on the left side of the sofa. Shadows fall naturally toward the right side of the sofa, consistent with directional lighting from the left. Both the front and side sections of the sofa exhibit similar shadow patterns—soft gradients under the cushions and along the edges—indicating a single, coherent light source. There are no conflicting shadow directions or unnatural brightness levels that would suggest inconsistent lighting. This consistency supports realistic rendering and enhances the perceived depth and dimensionality of the space.",

      "question": "Do objects around the sofa (e.g., wall art) appear correctly scaled and positioned relative to the combined view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The large abstract painting above the sofa in Image B is centered and proportionally sized relative to the sofa and the wall. Its width spans approximately the length of the sofa’s front section, which is a common design practice for balancing visual weight. The artwork is hung at eye level, consistent with standard interior design guidelines. The distance between the top of the sofa and the bottom of the painting is appropriate, allowing for visual breathing room without appearing too high or too low. The positioning of the artwork remains consistent with the perspective of the sofa, and there is no distortion or misalignment that would suggest incorrect scaling or placement. Furthermore, the shadow cast by the painting on the wall aligns with the light direction, reinforcing the coherence of the scene. All these factors indicate that the wall art is correctly scaled and positioned within the context of the combined front and side view.",
