        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the top left corner contains bold, black text that reads 'Clean First'. This text is clearly visible and positioned in the upper-left quadrant of the image. The font is large and legible, contrasting with the light-colored tiled background. Based on visual analysis, this text was not present in the original image (Image A), which lacks any overlaid text. Therefore, it can be concluded that 'Clean First' has been added to the top left corner in the edited version.",

      "question": "Is the exact phrase \"Clean First\" used for the slogan in the top left corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text in the top left corner is clearly readable as 'Clean First', with no variations in spelling or formatting. The words are capitalized appropriately ('Clean' and 'First'), and there are no additional characters, symbols, or misspellings. Comparing this to common slogan conventions, the phrase is concise and matches standard promotional language. There is no evidence of alteration or substitution. Thus, the exact phrase 'Clean First' is used.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom right corner features another bold, black text block that reads 'Comfort Always'. This text is positioned near the lower-right edge of the image, just above the base of the toilet. It is stylistically consistent with the top-left text—same font, size, and color—suggesting intentional design placement. In contrast, Image A does not contain any text in this region. Therefore, 'Comfort Always' has been added specifically to the bottom right corner in the edited version.",

      "question": "Does the exact phrase \"Comfort Always\" appear as the slogan in the bottom right corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in the bottom right corner of Image B is clearly legible and matches the exact phrase 'Comfort Always'. Both words are properly capitalized, and there are no typographical errors or modifications. The layout and font style align with typical branding or promotional slogans. No alternative phrasing such as 'Always Comfort' or 'Comfort First' is present. Hence, the exact phrase is used.",

      "question": "Does the design of the edited image reflect characteristics of a public health promotion poster, including clear and appropriately styled text for the slogans?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) incorporates two prominent slogans—'Clean First' and 'Comfort Always'—in bold, high-contrast black text placed strategically in the corners. These placements ensure visibility without obstructing the main subject (the toilet). The use of simple, sans-serif fonts enhances readability, which is essential for public messaging. The slogans themselves convey hygiene and comfort, themes commonly associated with public health campaigns related to sanitation. Additionally, the clean, uncluttered aesthetic supports message clarity. While not overly elaborate, the design adheres to principles of effective communication in public health materials: simplicity, legibility, and thematic relevance. Therefore, the design reflects characteristics of a public health promotion poster.",
