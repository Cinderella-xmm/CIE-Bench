        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the word 'Fresh' is clearly visible in white, bold, sans-serif font positioned in the lower-left corner of the image. This placement aligns with the description of 'bottom left.' The text does not overlap with any major visual elements like the apples or the wooden surface, ensuring readability. Based on standard layout conventions and visual inspection, this location matches the definition of 'bottom left.'",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Sweet' appears in white, bold, sans-serif font near the upper-right corner of the frame. It is positioned above and to the right of the apples, aligned with the edge of the image. This placement corresponds directly to the 'top right' region. The positioning is consistent with typical design practices for overlay text in promotional imagery.",

      "question": "Are the words \"Fresh\" and \"Sweet\" presented in a minimalist style suitable for a fruit brand poster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typography used for 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' is clean, modern, and uncluttered—characteristics of a minimalist design. The font is sans-serif, which enhances legibility and conveys simplicity. The white color contrasts well against the darker background and the rich red of the apples, making the text stand out without overwhelming the image. Minimalist branding often relies on such clear, direct messaging with limited visual noise. Given that the text is strategically placed and stylistically cohesive with natural, fresh imagery, it is highly suitable for a fruit brand poster.",

      "question": "Have the original visual elements, such as the apples and their setting, remained unchanged apart from the added text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing Image A and Image B, the apples, their positioning, lighting, texture, and the wooden surface beneath them appear identical. The background, including the blurred green foliage and window light, also remains consistent. The only difference between the two images is the addition of the words 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' in Image B. No alterations to the apples’ appearance, shadows, or environment are evident. Therefore, the core visual elements have been preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "A detailed comparison between Image A and Image B reveals that the only modification is the inclusion of the two words: 'Fresh' at the bottom left and 'Sweet' at the top right. There are no changes in color grading, lighting, composition, or object placement. The apples, table, background, and depth of field remain exactly the same. Thus, no other edits—such as filters, cropping, or digital enhancements—are detectable beyond the textual additions.",
