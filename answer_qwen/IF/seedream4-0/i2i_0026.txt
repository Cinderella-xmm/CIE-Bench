    "Question": "Q1: Does the illustration include four frames showing the stages of prepare, swing, hit, and follow-through?",
    "explanation": "The illustration in Image B consists of four distinct panels arranged vertically. Each panel depicts a different stage of a tennis forehand stroke. The top-left panel shows the player in a ready stance (prepare), the top-right panel shows the player initiating the swing, the middle panel captures the moment just before contact (swing), and the bottom panel shows the player completing the stroke with the racket following through after hitting the ball. This sequence aligns with the standard phases of a tennis forehand: preparation, backswing, impact, and follow-through. Therefore, the illustration includes all four key stages.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the illustration drawn in clean line art style?",
    "explanation": "The illustration features clear, bold outlines defining the figure, clothing, and tennis equipment. There is minimal shading or texture, and the lines are consistent and precise, which is characteristic of clean line art. The figures are stylized with simplified forms but maintain clear anatomical structure and motion. This approach emphasizes clarity and readability, typical of instructional illustrations. Hence, the drawing style can be classified as clean line art.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the illustration use monochrome color fill?",
    "explanation": "The illustration uses multiple colors: red for the shirt, black for shorts and wristband, white for skin tone, yellow for the tennis ball, and gray for the background. Since more than one color is used and there is no restriction to a single hue or grayscale, the color scheme is not monochrome. Monochrome would imply variation only within a single color family or grayscale tones. The presence of distinct, varied colors like red, black, and yellow confirms that the illustration does not use monochrome color fill.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the background been completely removed from the illustration?",
    "explanation": "The background in the illustration is simplified and uniform, consisting of a flat gray tone with minimal detail. However, it is not entirely absent—there are horizontal lines suggesting court markings and subtle depth cues such as the ground plane and shadowing under the player’s feet. These elements indicate that while the background is abstracted and minimized, it has not been completely removed. In contrast, a fully removed background would leave the figure floating against a transparent or white backdrop. Thus, the background is present but stylized.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the 4-frame illustration arranged in a horizontal format as an instructional strip?",
    "explanation": "The four panels in the illustration are stacked vertically, not horizontally. The sequence progresses from top to bottom: first row (two panels side by side), then a single panel below, and finally another panel at the bottom. This vertical layout contrasts with a horizontal strip format, which would place all panels in a single row from left to right. Instructional strips often use horizontal layouts to simulate motion across time, but here the arrangement is vertical. Therefore, the illustration is not in a horizontal format.",
    "answer": "No"
