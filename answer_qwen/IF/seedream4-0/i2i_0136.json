      "question": "Is the orange depicted as a rubber keychain rather than a natural fruit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembles an orange in shape and color but exhibits characteristics inconsistent with a natural fruit. The surface is uniformly smooth and highly reflective, suggesting a synthetic material like plastic or rubber rather than the textured peel of a real orange. Additionally, the presence of a green stem that appears artificial and a metallic ring at the top indicates it is designed as a decorative item. These visual cues, combined with common knowledge about keychains and their design, lead to the conclusion that this is not a natural fruit but a rubber or plastic keychain shaped like an orange.",

      "question": "Does the keychain still retain the original stem of the orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stem is present but clearly artificial—green, smooth, and rigid, unlike the natural, woody, and slightly irregular stem of a real orange. In Image A, the stem is brown, textured, and organic-looking, consistent with a natural fruit. Comparing both images, the stem in Image B is not the original stem but a manufactured replica, likely made of plastic or rubber. This difference is evident through texture, color, and form, which aligns with the typical design of novelty keychains.",

      "question": "Does the keychain maintain the glossy texture seen in the original orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original orange in Image A has a naturally textured, slightly bumpy peel with a matte-to-subtle-gloss finish due to its skin pores and natural oils. In contrast, the object in Image B has a uniformly glossy, almost mirror-like surface, reflecting light sharply and smoothly. This high sheen is characteristic of synthetic materials like polished plastic or rubber, not natural citrus peels. While both objects are shiny, the nature of the gloss differs significantly. Therefore, the keychain does not maintain the natural texture but instead features an artificial glossy finish.",

      "question": "Is the keychain visually recognizable as a citrus fruit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite being a synthetic object, the keychain in Image B closely mimics the general shape, size, and color of a citrus fruit such as an orange. Its spherical form, bright orange hue, and green stem are all visual cues commonly associated with oranges. Even though the texture and details are stylized, the overall appearance is unmistakably reminiscent of a citrus fruit. Based on world knowledge, people often recognize such items as fruit-shaped trinkets or novelty items, even when they are not real. Thus, it remains visually recognizable as a citrus fruit.",

      "question": "Does the keychain include a visible attachment point like a ring or clip for keys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small metallic ring is visible at the top of the keychain, just above the green stem. This ring is a standard feature in keychains, allowing them to be attached to keys or bags. Its placement and structure are consistent with functional keychain design. There is no visible clip, but the presence of the ring confirms an attachment mechanism. This detail, combined with the object’s overall design, supports the conclusion that it is intended for use as a keychain.",
