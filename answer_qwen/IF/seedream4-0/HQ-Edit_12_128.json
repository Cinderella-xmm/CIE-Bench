      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the clock's frame appears to be made of a transparent, glass-like material with a smooth, polished surface that reflects light in a way consistent with crystal or high-quality glass. The structure includes ornate details such as columns and floral motifs, which are visible through the translucency, indicating the material is not opaque like wood. Furthermore, the way light passes through and refracts within the frame suggests it is made of a crystalline substance rather than solid wood. This conclusion is supported by world knowledge that crystal clocks often feature such materials for aesthetic appeal and clarity. In contrast, wooden frames would typically have a matte or grainy texture and would not allow light to pass through. Therefore, based on visual cues and material properties, the frame is indeed made of translucent crystal.",

      "question": "Are the ornamental details and frame of the clock crafted from frosted crystal rather than carved wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental details of the clock—including the columns, floral patterns, and decorative elements—are clear and defined, but they do not appear frosted. Instead, they exhibit a high degree of transparency and clarity, with sharp edges and reflective surfaces characteristic of polished crystal. Frosted crystal would have a milky or diffused appearance, which is absent here. The material is more akin to clear, cut crystal rather than frosted glass. Comparing this to typical wooden clocks (as seen in Image A), carved wood would show grain patterns, color variation, and a matte finish, none of which are present in Image B. Thus, while the frame is crystal, it is not frosted; it is clear and polished.",

      "question": "Is the clock face made of smooth, clear crystal with etched Roman numerals instead of a wooden face with painted numerals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock face in Image B is visibly transparent, with Roman numerals that appear to be etched into the surface rather than painted. The numerals are uniformly thin and integrated into the material, consistent with laser etching or engraving on crystal. The background of the face is clear, allowing light to pass through, which is inconsistent with a painted wooden face. In contrast, Image A shows a wooden clock face with dark, painted Roman numerals on a beige, textured background. The difference in material opacity and numeral integration confirms that Image B’s face is made of smooth, clear crystal with etched markings, not painted wood.",

      "question": "Has the pendulum been replaced with a faceted crystal ornament instead of a solid wooden disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pendulum is clearly a spherical, multi-faceted object that resembles a cut gemstone or crystal ball. It has numerous flat, reflective surfaces that catch and refract light, creating a sparkling effect typical of faceted crystal. This contrasts sharply with the solid wooden disc seen in Image A, which has a smooth, non-reflective surface and a darker, matte finish. The design and optical properties of the pendulum in Image B confirm it is a faceted crystal ornament, not a wooden disc. World knowledge about decorative clocks supports that such crystal pendulums are used for aesthetic enhancement in modern or luxury designs.",

      "question": "Is the clock mounted on a minimalist white marble wall with visible natural veining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a light-colored surface with subtle grayish veins running through it, consistent with the appearance of white marble. The pattern is irregular and organic, matching the natural veining commonly found in marble. The surface is smooth and clean, with no visible textures or imperfections that would suggest paint or plaster. This contrasts with the darker, textured wall in Image A, which appears to be aged or distressed plaster. Given the visual characteristics—color, texture, and veining—it is reasonable to conclude that the clock is mounted on a minimalist white marble wall, aligning with common interior design aesthetics where such materials are used for elegance and simplicity.",
