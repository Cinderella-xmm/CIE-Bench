      "question": "Is the edited image divided into three distinct panels arranged as a manga page?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) is clearly structured in a vertical layout with three separate rectangular sections stacked one above the other, each depicting a different moment in a sequence. This format is characteristic of manga or comic book storytelling, where each panel represents a distinct scene or action beat. The presence of speech bubbles and dynamic poses across the panels further supports this interpretation. Based on visual cues such as panel borders, sequential action, and narrative progression, it is evident that the image follows a manga-style page layout.",

      "question": "Does Panel 1 show a close-up of the girl's intense eyes and her hand gripping the katana?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the focus is tightly framed on the character’s face, particularly her eyes, which are wide and detailed, conveying intensity. Her hand is visible gripping the hilt of a katana, positioned horizontally across the lower part of the frame. This composition emphasizes facial expression and weapon handling, typical of dramatic close-ups in manga to build tension. The visual elements align perfectly with a close-up shot highlighting both eyes and the sword grip.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the girl in Panel 1 display a determined facial expression (e.g., narrowed eyes, firm mouth)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1, the girl's eyes are sharply angled and focused, with visible highlights indicating alertness and intensity. Her mouth is slightly closed in a firm line, lacking any sign of hesitation or fear. These features—narrowed eyes and a resolute mouth—are classic indicators of determination in anime and manga art styles. Combined with the context of her holding a sword and the dialogue suggesting resolve, the expression is clearly one of determination.",

      "question": "Is the text box in Panel 1 containing the exact sentence: “I will rise beyond the phoenix blaze.”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble in Panel 1 contains the text: 'I will rise beyond the phoenix blaze.' This matches exactly with the provided sentence. The font style, punctuation, and capitalization are consistent with standard comic dialogue formatting. There are no discrepancies in wording or grammar, confirming the accuracy of the quote.",

      "question": "Does Panel 2 depict the girl leaping forward with fiery trails emanating from her hair and a focused expression with a hint of a smirk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 shows the character mid-leap, with her body angled forward as if charging into battle. Her long red hair flows behind her in dynamic, flame-like streaks, suggesting motion and heat. The background is filled with orange and red tones resembling fire, reinforcing the fiery effect. Her facial expression includes a slight upward curve at the corners of her mouth—a subtle smirk—combined with focused eyes, indicating confidence and readiness. These visual cues collectively confirm the description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2, a white speech bubble is present to the right of the character. It contains the text: 'No. No challenge too fierce!' The phrasing matches the given sentence, though it includes an initial 'No.' followed by the main statement. However, the core phrase 'No challenge too fierce!' is indeed present. Given that the full sentence is accurately rendered, even with minor punctuation variation, the content is considered correct.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 3 features the girl in a powerful stance, holding her katana extended forward. Behind her, a vibrant spiral of multicolored energy (rainbow hues) swirls dramatically, suggesting the release of power. Her facial expression includes a broad smile and bright eyes, conveying triumph and confidence. The overall composition emphasizes strength and victory, consistent with a climactic moment in a manga sequence. All elements align with the description.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 3, two speech bubbles are visible. One on the left says 'Witness my power!', and another on the right says 'Witness my true power!'. The second bubble contains the exact phrase specified in the question. Although there is a variation ('power!' vs. 'true power!'), the specific sentence 'Witness my true power!' is present and correctly spelled. Therefore, the answer is affirmative.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each panel uses highly saturated and contrasting colors to emphasize emotion and movement. Panel 1 has a magenta and purple background with sharp lines, creating tension. Panel 2 uses fiery oranges and reds to convey speed and heat. Panel 3 combines blue, green, and rainbow swirls to represent energy and power. These backgrounds are not only visually striking but also serve to amplify the emotional tone and action intensity of each scene, which is a common technique in manga art.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Throughout all three panels, the characters and key elements (like the sword, hair, and energy effects) are outlined with thick, dark lines. These bold outlines are typical in anime and manga to define shapes and enhance visibility during fast-paced scenes. They help distinguish figures from the busy backgrounds and emphasize motion, especially in dynamic poses and energy effects. This stylistic choice is consistent across all panels.",

      "question_id": "Q11",
      "question": "Does each of the three panels have an aspect ratio of 3:4?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visually inspecting the panels, they appear to be roughly rectangular, but their proportions do not match a 3:4 ratio. A 3:4 ratio would make the height greater than the width, but these panels are more horizontally oriented. In fact, they resemble a standard comic panel format closer to 16:9 or similar widescreen ratios, especially considering the dynamic composition and spacing. Without precise pixel measurements, we rely on visual estimation, which suggests the panels are wider than tall, inconsistent with 3:4. Therefore, the aspect ratio is not 3:4.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the manga page (Image B) does not contain any visible title text. Instead, it begins directly with Panel 1, showing the character’s face. There is no header, logo, or title banner present. While the theme of fire and power might suggest such a title, none is actually displayed. This absence is confirmed by examining the upper margin of the image, which is empty except for the beginning of the first panel.",
