      "question": "Has the shoe upper been replaced with a transparent material that reveals intricate circuitry patterns inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper part of the sneaker appears to be made of a translucent or transparent material, allowing visibility into the internal structure. Inside, there are visible blue glowing lines resembling electronic circuitry, which are not present in typical athletic footwear. This design choice suggests a futuristic, tech-inspired aesthetic where the internal components are intentionally exposed for visual effect. The transparency and embedded circuit-like patterns are consistent with a conceptual or digital rendering rather than a real-world product. Based on this visual evidence and combining it with world knowledge about futuristic design trends (e.g., smart shoes, wearable tech), it is reasonable to conclude that the shoe upper has indeed been replaced with a transparent material to showcase these internal elements.",

      "question": "Does the Swoosh logo emit a cool neon blue glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Swoosh logo on the side of the shoe in Image B is clearly illuminated with a bright, neon blue light. This glow is distinct from standard printed or stitched logos and aligns with the overall futuristic theme of the shoe. The lighting effect appears to be integrated into the design, possibly simulating LED illumination. Given that the rest of the shoe features glowing circuitry and a high-tech aesthetic, the glowing Swoosh fits within this context. In contrast, traditional Nike sneakers have static logos without illumination. Therefore, based on the visual cues and the context of the image's style, the Swoosh does emit a neon blue glow.",

      "question": "Is there a small digital screen attached to the strap that displays dynamic animations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the strap of the shoe in Image B, there is a rectangular component that resembles a small digital screen. It displays colorful, animated graphics, including what appear to be digital readouts or abstract visuals. This feature is not found on standard athletic shoes but is consistent with advanced wearable technology concepts. The presence of such a screen, combined with the glowing circuits and futuristic box, supports the idea that this is a digitally rendered concept shoe designed to showcase cutting-edge technology. Thus, based on the visual information and reasoning through known tech integration trends in fashion, the screen is indeed present and shows dynamic content.",

      "question": "Is there a collapsible digital shoe box with a metallic finish and holographic branding visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, behind the shoe, there is a box with a sleek, metallic surface and vibrant, iridescent colors that shift across its surface—characteristic of holographic effects. The box features the Nike logo in a glowing, neon style, along with geometric designs and illuminated outlines, suggesting a high-tech, digital aesthetic. Its shape includes foldable edges and a compact form, implying it could be collapsible. These attributes—metallic finish, holographic branding, and modern design—are consistent with a futuristic, digital shoe box concept. While real-world shoe boxes are typically cardboard, this one is clearly stylized as a digital or conceptual object. Therefore, based on the visual cues and interpretation through design trends in tech-themed products, the box matches the description.",

      "question": "Are modern geometric patterns visible on the surface of the digital shoe box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital shoe box in Image B is adorned with sharp, angular lines and polygonal shapes that form a network of geometric patterns. These include hexagons, rectangles, and linear circuits, all outlined in glowing neon colors. These patterns are not random but structured, resembling futuristic interface designs or circuit boards. Such geometric motifs are commonly used in sci-fi and tech-inspired visuals to convey advanced technology. Given the overall aesthetic of the image, these patterns serve both decorative and thematic purposes. Therefore, based on the clear visual evidence and alignment with modern digital design language, modern geometric patterns are indeed present on the box.",

      "question": "Does the sneaker retain its original structural proportions and silhouette despite the futuristic modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to the original shoe in Image A, the basic silhouette—the overall shape, toe box, heel height, and midsole profile—remains consistent. Despite the addition of transparent materials, glowing circuits, and a digital screen, the foundational structure of the sneaker has not been altered in terms of scale or proportion. The modifications are superficial or internal enhancements rather than changes to the shoe’s core form. This suggests that while the design has been futurized, the original ergonomic and aesthetic proportions have been preserved. This retention of form is common in conceptual redesigns where the goal is to enhance functionality or appearance without changing usability. Thus, based on visual comparison and understanding of product design principles, the sneaker retains its original structural proportions.",
