      "question": "Is the overall composition and style of the image consistent with a Qing Dynasty traditional portrait, including formal posture and dignified expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B is positioned in a formal, upright stance with hands gently clasped in front, which aligns with traditional Qing Dynasty portraiture conventions where subjects—especially members of the imperial court or aristocracy—were depicted with composed, dignified postures. The facial expression is serene and poised, lacking overt emotion, which is characteristic of formal portraits from that era. Additionally, the lighting is soft and directional, emphasizing the subject's features without harsh shadows, a technique commonly used in historical Chinese portraiture to convey elegance and status. The background includes classical elements such as calligraphy scrolls and wooden furniture, further reinforcing the authenticity of the setting. These visual cues collectively suggest a deliberate effort to emulate the stylistic norms of Qing Dynasty portraiture.",

      "question": "Does the subject wear a robe with visible, detailed dragon embroidery on a silk-like fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject is wearing a richly embroidered robe with prominent golden dragons intricately stitched across the chest, sleeves, and lower torso. The texture of the fabric appears smooth and lustrous, consistent with high-quality silk, often used in imperial attire during the Qing Dynasty. Dragon motifs are central to Chinese imperial symbolism, particularly in garments worn by royalty or high-ranking officials. The embroidery is highly detailed, featuring scales, claws, and flowing manes, indicating skilled craftsmanship typical of period textiles. The presence of multiple dragons, combined with the luxurious material, strongly suggests this is an authentic representation of Qing-era ceremonial clothing.",

      "question": "Are there visible pieces of jade jewelry, such as pendants, necklaces, or earrings, that appear opulent and made of jade material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject wears a long, multi-strand necklace composed of green beads that closely resemble jade, a material historically associated with nobility and spiritual significance in Chinese culture. Matching jade earrings dangle from her ears, and she also wears a jade ring on her right hand. These items are not only visually consistent with jade’s characteristic translucent green hue but are also styled in ways typical of Qing Dynasty aristocratic adornments. Jade was considered a symbol of virtue and purity, and its use in royal accessories was common. The polished finish and uniformity of the beads suggest high-quality craftsmanship, reinforcing the impression of opulence.",

      "question": "Has the subject’s hairstyle been replaced with an ornate headpiece featuring intricate jade hairpins?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject’s hair is styled into a traditional Qing Dynasty headdress known as a 'liangti' or 'fengguan,' which is adorned with elaborate gold filigree and numerous jade-like ornaments. These include large jade pendants, floral-shaped jade pieces, and dangling tassels, all integrated into the structure of the headpiece. This type of headwear was reserved for women of high status, particularly in the imperial court. The inclusion of jade hairpins and decorative elements directly corresponds to historical accounts of Qing noblewomen’s hairstyles. Therefore, the hairstyle has indeed been transformed into an ornate, culturally accurate headpiece.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B depicts an interior space resembling a traditional Chinese study or scholar’s chamber. On the walls, there are several vertical scrolls displaying classical Chinese calligraphy, which is a hallmark of such rooms during the Qing Dynasty. These scrolls are mounted on wooden frames and hung symmetrically, suggesting a cultivated and scholarly environment. Additionally, there is a wooden desk with open books and writing implements, further reinforcing the academic atmosphere. This setting is consistent with the lifestyle of educated elites or imperial family members who valued literature and art. Thus, the background clearly features classic Chinese scrolls and conveys the ambiance of an elegant study room.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color scheme of Image B prominently features deep crimson red as the base color of the robe, which is symbolic of power, prosperity, and good fortune in Chinese culture. Gold is used extensively in the dragon embroidery and trimmings, representing imperial authority and wealth. Deep green accents appear in the borders of the robe, the jade jewelry, and parts of the headpiece, adding contrast and richness. These three colors—red, gold, and deep green—are historically significant in Qing Dynasty imperial attire and decor. Their combination here creates a visually harmonious and culturally appropriate palette that reflects both luxury and tradition.",

      "question": "Has the subject’s facial features and overall posture remained consistent with the original image, aside from the additions of costume and accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the subject’s facial structure—including eye shape, nose, lips, and jawline—remains unchanged. The skin tone, makeup style (with defined eyebrows and subtle blush), and general facial symmetry are identical in both images, indicating that the digital editing process preserved the original facial characteristics. The posture is also similar: both images show the subject standing with a straight back and hands positioned near the waist. However, while the basic pose is consistent, the orientation and slight tilt of the head differ slightly due to the new costume and headpiece requiring adjustments in framing. Nonetheless, these changes are minimal and do not alter the fundamental facial features or core posture. The consistency suggests that the edit focused primarily on costume and setting rather than modifying the subject’s identity.",
