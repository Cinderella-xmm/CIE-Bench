      "question": "Has melted cheese been added on top of the hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible yellowish substance on top of the hot dog that appears to be melted cheese. The texture and color are consistent with cheese that has been heated and softened, likely due to the grill's heat. This observation aligns with common practices in preparing hot dogs, where cheese is often added as a topping and melts during grilling or serving. The presence of this substance directly on the sausage supports the conclusion that melted cheese has been added.",

      "question": "Have fried onions been added on top of the hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are golden-brown, translucent, curled pieces atop the hot dog that resemble caramelized or fried onions. These toppings have a characteristic appearance associated with sautéed or grilled onions, which become soft and slightly crispy when cooked. Their placement and texture are consistent with typical hot dog garnishes, particularly in styles like 'Chicago-style' or 'Coney Island' hot dogs, where onions are commonly used. Therefore, based on visual cues and culinary knowledge, fried onions have been added.",

      "question": "Is there a barbecue tong added near the grill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a metallic object with a claw-like end is visible on the right side of the frame, positioned near the hot dog. This object has the distinct shape and reflective surface of a barbecue tong, commonly used for handling food on grills. Its placement suggests it is being used to hold or turn the hot dog. Based on its design and context—grill setting, proximity to food—it is reasonable to conclude that a barbecue tong has been added to the scene.",

      "question": "Are the hot dog buns and sausages still visible and identifiable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the hot dog buns and sausages remain clearly visible. The buns are light brown, elongated, and split open to hold the sausages, which are reddish-brown and glossy, indicating they are cooked. Despite the addition of toppings such as cheese and onions, the structural integrity and shape of both the buns and sausages are preserved and distinguishable. This visibility is consistent with standard presentation of grilled hot dogs, even when topped with ingredients.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, bright orange and yellow flames are clearly visible through the gaps of the black metal grill grates beneath the hot dogs. The grill itself is also distinctly visible, with parallel bars forming the cooking surface. The flames indicate active heating, which is typical for grilling. The combination of visible flames and the grill structure confirms that both elements are present and clearly observable in the image.",
