      "question": "Has the hairstyle been transformed into a swirling, fluffy cotton candy form with pastel pink and blue hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is clearly stylized to resemble cotton candy, characterized by its soft, swirling texture and pastel colorsâ€”specifically shades of pink and light blue. This visual transformation deviates significantly from natural hair, which would have a fibrous, matte appearance. The use of smooth, cloud-like swirls and vibrant pastel tones aligns with the aesthetic commonly associated with cotton candy. Based on this analysis, the hairstyle has indeed been transformed into a whimsical, candy-like form.",

      "question": "Has the suit been replaced with a stylized 3D paper doll version featuring a glossy surface and bold geometric patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the suit rendered in a low-poly, angular style typical of 3D paper doll or origami-inspired art. The surfaces are flat and faceted, with sharp edges and reflective highlights suggesting a glossy finish. These characteristics are inconsistent with a realistic suit, which would have soft folds and fabric textures. Instead, the design emphasizes geometric shapes and a synthetic sheen, consistent with digital 3D modeling aesthetics. Therefore, the suit has been replaced with a stylized, geometric representation.",

      "question": "Has the tie been replaced with an oversized, cartoon-style element featuring bright, contrasting colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tie in Image B is no longer a conventional necktie. It features exaggerated proportions, vibrant colors (including pink, yellow, blue, and red), and cartoonish elements such as a smiling face with large eyes and a star motif. These traits are indicative of a playful, animated design rather than a formal accessory. The overall style is whimsical and highly stylized, fitting the description of a cartoon-style element. Thus, the tie has been replaced with a visually distinct, cartoon-themed version.",

      "question": "Have the facial features and expression of the person remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the man's facial features are realistic, with natural skin texture, wrinkles, and subtle shading. In contrast, Image B presents a stylized, low-poly rendition where the face is composed of flat, angular planes, and the eyes, nose, and mouth are simplified into geometric forms. While the general expression (a smile) is preserved, the details are abstracted and exaggerated. The transformation alters the realism of the facial structure, indicating that the features have not remained unchanged.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all modified elements (hair, clothing, tie) visually consistent with their respective stylized forms (cotton candy, paper doll, cartoon) and not mixed with realistic details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each modified element in Image B adheres to a specific stylized theme: the hair resembles cotton candy with its soft, swirled pastel appearance; the suit follows a 3D paper doll aesthetic with sharp geometric facets and a glossy surface; and the tie is cartoonish, featuring bright colors and a playful character design. There is no blending of realistic textures (e.g., fabric, hair strands) with these stylized forms. All elements maintain thematic consistency within their respective artistic styles, without introducing contradictory realistic details.",
