      "question": "Is the athlete depicted in anime-style, with attention to sporty details like attire and accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The athlete in Image B is clearly rendered in an anime art style, characterized by exaggerated proportions, stylized hair, large expressive eyes, and smooth shading typical of Japanese animation. The attire includes a visor, tank top, tennis skirt, and athletic shoes—all consistent with tennis apparel—though stylized with clean lines and simplified textures common in anime. Accessories such as the visor and racket are present and proportionally accurate for a tennis player, indicating attention to sport-specific detail despite the artistic exaggeration. This combination of stylistic elements confirms the anime aesthetic while maintaining relevant sportswear accuracy.",

      "question": "Has the athlete's pose been kept the same as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the athlete is in a low crouch, leaning forward with one hand on the ground and the racket extended toward the court, suggesting readiness to return a low shot. In Image B, the athlete maintains a very similar crouched position with the same hand placement and racket orientation. The body angle, leg positioning, and overall posture are preserved, indicating that the pose has been faithfully retained from the original photo. While the execution is stylized due to the anime rendering, the core dynamic of the pose remains unchanged, demonstrating consistency in action depiction between the two images.",

      "question": "Does the athlete have enhanced facial expressions with focused eyes and light effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The athlete in Image B exhibits a highly detailed facial expression typical of anime character design. Her eyes are large, bright, and sharply focused, conveying intense concentration—a common trope used to emphasize determination or focus in sports scenes. Additionally, there are visible light effects around her eyes and face, such as highlights and sparkles, which enhance the sense of intensity and drama. These visual enhancements go beyond realistic representation and are characteristic of anime’s emphasis on emotional expression through exaggerated features and lighting cues.",

      "question": "Is there a visible energy glow added to the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features vibrant, swirling golden light streaks and radiant glows that resemble energy waves or motion trails. These effects are not present in real-world photography and are instead stylized visual elements commonly used in anime to convey speed, power, or dramatic tension. The glowing patterns radiate outward from behind the athlete, creating a sense of dynamic movement and heightened emotion. This is a clear example of digital enhancement designed to amplify the scene’s impact, confirming the presence of an artificial energy glow.",

      "question": "Does the image conform to the format of a character card banner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is framed with a rounded border and has a glossy, polished appearance typical of character cards seen in anime or video games. The composition centers the athlete dynamically within the frame, with a dramatic background and visual effects that draw attention to her. The overall layout, including the use of borders, lighting, and stylization, aligns closely with the design conventions of character banners used in media such as anime promotional material or collectible cards. Therefore, it conforms to the format of a character card banner.",
