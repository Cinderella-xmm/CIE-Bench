      "question": "Is the entire ceramic form now constructed from interlocking puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceramic sculpture appears to be partially composed of interlocking puzzle pieces. The front face, including the facial features such as the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears, remains intact and solid, showing no signs of being made from puzzle pieces. However, the back and side sections of the sculpture are visibly segmented into interlocking puzzle-like tiles with distinct edges and shapes. This suggests that only a portion of the ceramic form—specifically the rear and lateral surfaces—is constructed from puzzle pieces, while the facial area retains its original solid structure. Therefore, the entire form is not made of interlocking puzzle pieces.",

      "question": "Are the puzzle pieces primarily beige and brown in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The puzzle pieces visible on the back and side of the ceramic sculpture in Image B are indeed colored in shades of beige and brown. These colors match the overall tone of the ceramic material, suggesting they were designed to blend with the original surface. The puzzle pieces appear to be glazed or painted to mimic the texture and hue of the rest of the sculpture, using a palette dominated by earthy tones. There are no vibrant or contrasting colors present among the puzzle pieces, reinforcing the conclusion that their primary colors are beige and brown.",

      "question": "Are the puzzle piece edges aligned smoothly to create a continuous surface without visible gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the edges of the puzzle pieces are clearly defined and interlock in a way typical of jigsaw puzzles. However, there are visible seams and slight irregularities between the pieces, indicating that the alignment is not perfectly smooth. While the pieces fit together closely, small gaps and variations in height can be observed along the joints, especially where the beige and brown sections meet. These imperfections suggest that the surface is not completely seamless, and the puzzle construction introduces subtle discontinuities in the otherwise smooth ceramic form.",

      "question": "Has the conical top been replaced with a smooth green puzzle fragment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the ceramic sculpture in Image B still features a green, rounded section that resembles a conical or dome-like shape. This green area appears to be a single, smooth piece rather than a fragmented puzzle element. It does not display the characteristic interlocking edges or segmented appearance of the other puzzle pieces on the body. Additionally, the green surface lacks the jagged contours typical of puzzle pieces, suggesting it has remained unaltered. Therefore, the conical top has not been replaced with a puzzle fragment; it remains intact and smooth.",

      "question": "Is the sculpture positioned horizontally on a plain white shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceramic sculpture is placed on a flat, white surface that appears to be a shelf. The sculpture lies on its side, with the face oriented toward the left and the back extending to the right, indicating a horizontal orientation. The shelf is clean, minimalist, and uniformly white, with no visible decorations or markings. The background is also plain and light-colored, consistent with a studio or display setting. Based on these visual cues, the sculpture is indeed positioned horizontally on a plain white shelf.",
