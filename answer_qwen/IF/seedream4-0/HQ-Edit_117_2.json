      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layout clearly shows three distinct sections arranged in a collage format. The top-left section contains two illustrated clay pots on a lined background resembling cardstock. The bottom-left section features a cartoon-style cucumber and bread slice with facial features and limbs, also on a similar textured background. The right side of the image displays a full-length illustration of a woman in a kitchen, again on a background with horizontal lines mimicking notebook paper or cardstock. These three sections are visually separated by white borders and appear to be designed as individual postcards. Each has a consistent aged-paper texture and ruled lines, suggesting they are meant to resemble physical postcards. Based on this visual structure and common design conventions for postcards, it is reasonable to conclude that the image contains three separate postcards.",

      "question": "Are the pots in the first postcard visibly modified with embossed tribal patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The first postcard in Image B shows two clay pots rendered in a stylized illustrative manner. Both pots feature intricate geometric designs that resemble traditional African tribal motifs, such as zigzags, triangles, and parallel lines. These patterns are not flat but are drawn with shading and depth, giving them an embossed appearance. This visual cue suggests that the designs are intended to look raised or carved into the surface of the pots, which aligns with the concept of 'embossed' patterns. In real-world pottery, such patterns are often incised or molded into the clay before firing, and the artistic representation here captures that tactile quality through line work and shadowing. Therefore, based on the visual details and typical artistic conventions used to depict texture and relief, the pots do appear to have embossed tribal patterns.",

      "question": "Is the dress in the second postcard rendered in a cartoon style with expanded or exaggerated motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second postcard (the rightmost section) features a woman wearing a colorful dress with bold, vibrant patterns. The style of the illustration is simplified and stylized, consistent with cartoon or graphic art rather than photorealism. The motifs on the dress—such as spirals, geometric shapes, and abstract forms—are larger and more pronounced than would typically be seen in realistic depictions of fabric. These elements are exaggerated in size and color contrast, and their outlines are bold and clean, characteristic of cartoon rendering. Additionally, the overall composition uses flat colors and minimal shading, further reinforcing the cartoon aesthetic. Compared to realistic portrayals of African textiles, where patterns are often smaller and more densely packed, the motifs here are clearly enlarged and stylized for visual impact. Thus, the dress is indeed rendered in a cartoon style with expanded or exaggerated motifs.",

      "question": "Are the bread and cucumber in the third postcard depicted as cute, character-like figures with facial features or limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The third postcard, located in the bottom-left section of Image B, shows a cucumber and a slice of bread. Both objects are anthropomorphized: they have simple facial features (eyes, mouths, and blush marks), arms, and legs. The cucumber has small black arms and legs, while the bread slice has stick-figure limbs and a cheerful expression. This depiction is clearly designed to make the food items appear cute and personified, a common technique in children's illustrations or kawaii-style art. Such character-like representations are used to evoke emotion and appeal to a playful audience. Given these visual cues—facial expressions, limbs, and expressive body language—it is evident that the bread and cucumber are portrayed as cute, character-like figures.",

      "question": "Do all three postcards feature a visible textured background resembling cardstock and include a blank area designated for writing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each of the three sections in Image B has a background that mimics the appearance of aged or textured cardstock, with a beige tone and faint horizontal lines resembling ruled notebook paper. This design choice is consistent across all three postcards, suggesting an intentional stylistic theme. Furthermore, each section includes ample blank space above or around the main illustration—especially noticeable in the top and bottom left postcards—where text could logically be written, as is typical for postcards. While the right-side postcard (featuring the woman) has less empty space due to the figure’s placement, there is still a margin at the top and sides that could serve as a writing area. The presence of lined backgrounds and open spaces aligns with standard postcard formats, where one side is reserved for messages. Therefore, all three postcards share both the textured cardstock appearance and a designated blank area for writing.",
