      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character exhibits exaggerated features typical of chibi-style animation, such as large eyes, a small nose, and a disproportionately large head relative to the body. The facial structure is simplified and stylized, with smooth, rounded contours and minimal shading, which are hallmarks of 3D chibi models often seen in collectible figurines or digital art. Additionally, the character's proportions—such as the oversized head and small limbs—are consistent with chibi design principles. These visual cues, combined with the overall plastic-like texture and lighting that suggests a 3D-rendered object rather than a real human, confirm that the person has been transformed into a 3D chibi-style cartoon character.",

      "question": "Is the character wearing a red xiuhe wedding dress with golden embroidery of phoenixes and floral patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is dressed in a traditional Chinese bridal outfit known as a xiuhe dress, identifiable by its high collar, mandarin-style buttons, and flowing silhouette. The dominant color is red, which is culturally significant in Chinese weddings for symbolizing luck and prosperity. The dress is richly decorated with golden embroidery featuring phoenixes—a common motif in Chinese bridal attire symbolizing harmony and nobility—and intricate floral patterns. These elements align perfectly with the traditional design of a xiuhe dress. The fabric appears satin-like, enhancing the luxurious feel typical of such garments. Therefore, based on visual evidence and cultural knowledge, the character is indeed wearing a red xiuhe wedding dress with golden phoenix and floral embroidery.",

      "question": "Are there graceful floral ornaments in the character's hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the character’s hairstyle in Image B, multiple decorative elements are visible within her hair. These include small, detailed flowers in shades of pink and white, along with gold filigree accents that resemble leaves or petals. These ornaments are delicately placed among her dark brown hair and appear to be part of a larger ornamental headdress. Such floral adornments are commonly found in traditional Chinese bridal hairstyles, especially when paired with ceremonial crowns. Their presence contributes to the festive and elegant appearance appropriate for a wedding theme. Thus, the character does have graceful floral ornaments in her hair.",

      "question": "Does the character wear a phoenix crown featuring a central red flower, ornamental gold 3D embellishments, and tassels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character’s headpiece in Image B is clearly a phoenix crown, a traditional element in Chinese bridal attire. At the center of the crown is a prominent red flower, likely representing a peony or rose, both symbolic of beauty and wealth. Surrounding this are elaborate gold 3D embellishments shaped like phoenixes, wings, and floral motifs, giving the crown a sculptural quality. On the sides, there are dangling gold tassels with bead-like details, which add movement and elegance. These components—central red flower, gold 3D designs, and tassels—are all present and consistent with authentic representations of phoenix crowns used in Chinese weddings. Hence, the description matches the visual content accurately.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the background of Image B, there is a large circular red decoration mounted on a wall. This design prominently displays the Chinese character “囍” (shuāng xǐ), meaning 'double happiness,' which is traditionally used in Chinese weddings to symbolize marital joy. The surrounding pattern includes symmetrical floral and geometric cutouts, characteristic of traditional paper-cut art (jianzhi). The use of red color and intricate cut-out style confirms it as a classic folk-style “囍” paper-cut. This type of decoration is commonly displayed during Chinese wedding ceremonies, further supporting its identification. Therefore, the backdrop does feature a classic folk-style “囍” paper-cut design.",
