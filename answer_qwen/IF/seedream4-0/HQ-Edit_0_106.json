      "question": "Is the lion rendered as a high-contrast silhouette with minimal internal detail and strong edge definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is depicted entirely in black against a lighter background, with no visible internal features such as fur texture, facial details, or musculature. This stark contrast between the dark figure and the light background creates a silhouette effect. The edges of the lion are sharply defined, indicating a deliberate stylistic choice to emphasize shape over detail. This aligns with common artistic techniques used in silhouettes, where the focus is on outline and form rather than realism. Based on visual cues and standard definitions of silhouette art, the lion is clearly rendered as a high-contrast silhouette.",

      "question": "Has the background been replaced with an abstract gradient composed of smooth color transitions rather than a realistic savannah landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a gradient transitioning from white to dark gray, with angular, geometric divisions that lack any naturalistic elements like clouds, sun, or horizon lines seen in a realistic savannah. There are no textures or depth cues associated with a real landscape. Instead, the background appears stylized and abstract, using clean lines and smooth tonal shifts. This contrasts sharply with a realistic savannah setting, which would include atmospheric perspective, sky gradients, and natural forms. Therefore, the background has indeed been replaced with an abstract design.",

      "question": "Are detailed grass textures clearly visible in the foreground of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground features tall grass represented by fine, vertical black lines that suggest texture. However, these lines are uniform and stylized, lacking the variation, depth, and lighting effects that would indicate realistic grass texture. While there is a suggestion of grass, it is simplified and lacks the nuanced detail (such as individual blades, shadows, or movement) present in natural scenes. Thus, although grass is implied, the texture is not 'clearly visible' in a detailed or lifelike manner.",

      "question": "Are the acacia trees depicted as angular, stylized silhouettes with sharp edges and geometric forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The acacia trees in Image B are rendered as solid black shapes with flat, sharp outlines. Their canopies have distinct, almost polygonal forms, and their branches are simplified into straight, angular lines rather than organic curves. This departure from natural tree morphology suggests a deliberate stylization. The use of geometric shapes and lack of natural branching patterns confirm that the trees are stylized, consistent with modern graphic design aesthetics. Therefore, they are indeed angular and geometric in appearance.",

      "question": "Is the title \"King of the Wild\" displayed in a dramatic, bold typeface across the upper section of the image without overpowering the lion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'King of the Wild' is positioned at the top of the image in a large, bold serif font, which stands out due to its size and weight. However, it is placed above the lion and does not intrude into the lion’s space or obscure its form. The font style is dramatic and commanding, fitting the theme, but its placement ensures the lion remains the central visual element. The contrast between the text and the background is high, yet it does not dominate the composition—instead, it complements the lion by reinforcing the thematic message. Thus, the title is dramatic and bold but does not overpower the main subject.",

      "question": "Is the lion positioned centrally and visually dominant in the composition, ensuring it remains the primary focus despite other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lion occupies the central area of Image B, both horizontally and vertically, and its silhouette is the largest and most prominent shape in the frame. Despite the presence of the title text and stylized trees, the lion’s size, placement, and contrast make it the undeniable focal point. Its posture—walking forward with head raised—further enhances its dominance. Even though the background and text are significant, they serve to frame and support the lion rather than compete with it. This compositional balance confirms that the lion is both centrally located and visually dominant.",
