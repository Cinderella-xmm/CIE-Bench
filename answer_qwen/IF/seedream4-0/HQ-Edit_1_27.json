      "question": "Is the scene enclosed within a visible decorative glass dome that surrounds the entire diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly shows a transparent, rounded glass enclosure with a golden ornate base and finial on top, which is characteristic of a traditional snow globe or diorama. The Eiffel Tower and surrounding winter scene are fully contained within this dome, which is evident from the reflections, curvature of the glass, and the way light interacts with the surface. The presence of snowflakes suspended inside the dome further supports that it is a sealed environment. This structure is not just a visual element but a functional container for the miniature scene, confirming that the entire diorama is enclosed in a decorative glass dome.",

      "question": "Does the snow in the scene have a delicate, powdery texture, appearing soft and lightly settled rather than dense or icy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the snow in the image, it appears fluffy and loosely accumulated, particularly around the base of trees, lampposts, and along the pathways. It lacks the hard, compacted appearance of ice or heavy packed snow. The way the snow clings to branches and forms soft mounds without sharp edges suggests a lightweight, powdery consistency. Additionally, the fine dusting on the cobblestones and the gentle layering over objects imply a fresh, light snowfall rather than a dense or icy accumulation. This aligns with typical representations of snow in decorative dioramas, where texture is stylized to appear delicate and ethereal.",

      "question": "Are all human figures in the scene noticeably smaller in scale and dressed in vintage-style clothing consistent with early 20th-century Parisian fashion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The human figures in the scene are indeed significantly smaller than life-size, consistent with the scale of a miniature diorama. Their clothing includes long coats, hats, and silhouettes typical of early 20th-century fashion—such as high collars, tailored coats, and formal wear—commonly associated with Parisian attire from that era. However, while most figures reflect this style, there is some variation in posture and detail that might suggest artistic interpretation rather than strict historical accuracy. Nonetheless, the overall impression is one of vintage Parisian fashion, and their reduced size is unmistakable given the context of a snow globe. Therefore, the description holds true across the board.",

      "question": "Are the streetlamps in the scene significantly smaller than normal scale and do they emit a soft, subtle glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The streetlamps in the image are proportionally much smaller than real-world counterparts, fitting the miniature scale of the diorama. They are evenly spaced along the pathway and feature classic Parisian-style lamp posts with glowing orbs at the top. The glow emitted by these lamps is warm and diffused, casting soft illumination on the surrounding snow and contributing to the cozy, wintery ambiance. This subtle lighting effect is consistent with how miniature scenes are designed to simulate ambient light without overpowering the composition. Thus, both the reduced scale and the soft glow are accurately depicted.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, leafless trees in the scene with only a light dusting of snow on their branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image contains several small, bare-branched trees positioned along the sides of the pathway. These trees are devoid of leaves, indicating a winter setting. The snow on their branches is minimal—only a light coating—suggesting a recent, gentle snowfall. The snow does not weigh down the branches or form thick layers, reinforcing the impression of a delicate dusting. This matches the aesthetic of a carefully crafted winter scene where snow is present but not overwhelming, preserving the structural details of the trees.",

      "question": "Are there visible cobblestone pathways, partially exposed and winding through the snow-covered ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the foreground of the scene, a distinct cobblestone path is visible, running directly toward the Eiffel Tower. The stones are arranged in a traditional pattern and are partially covered by snow, with some areas more exposed than others, suggesting a footpath that has seen light use. The path winds gently through the landscape, flanked by snowbanks and trees, creating a sense of depth and realism. This feature is consistent with historical Parisian streets and adds authenticity to the diorama’s design. The partial exposure of the cobblestones under the snow enhances the winter atmosphere while maintaining navigability.",
