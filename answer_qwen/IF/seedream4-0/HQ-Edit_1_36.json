      "question": "Does the elder have stylized, semi-cartoon features such as softened facial lines, exaggerated smile, or simplified proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elder's facial features are notably stylized. The skin appears smooth with minimal wrinkles compared to a realistic depiction of an elderly person. The eyes are large and expressive with prominent eyelashes, which is characteristic of animated or cartoon-style art. The smile is wide and exaggerated, showing teeth in a cheerful manner that goes beyond typical natural expressions. Additionally, the proportions of the face—such as the rounded cheeks and simplified jawline—are consistent with semi-cartoon aesthetics. These visual cues align with common traits seen in stylized digital illustrations or animated characters, where realism is sacrificed for emotional expressiveness and visual appeal. This contrasts with more lifelike portrayals that emphasize fine details like age-related skin texture and subtle facial contours.",

      "question": "Are there clearly visible and enhanced floral patterns on the hanbok, particularly along the collar and front panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hanbok features intricate floral designs that are clearly visible and artistically enhanced. Along the collar and front panel, there are detailed depictions of roses and other flowers in soft pastel colors, including pink, purple, and peach tones. These patterns are not only present but also appear deliberately emphasized with bright outlines and shading, suggesting intentional artistic enhancement rather than subtle embroidery. The design elements stand out against the translucent fabric, indicating that they were likely added or accentuated for visual impact. Compared to real-world hanbok designs, which often feature delicate stitching, this version uses digital rendering to amplify the floral motifs, making them more vivid and prominent. This level of detail suggests a stylized representation meant to highlight beauty and elegance.",

      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image pastel tones such as light pink, peach, mint, or lavender?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B is dominated by soft, gentle hues. The hanbok itself incorporates light pink, peach, mint green, and lavender shades, creating a harmonious and dreamy aesthetic. These colors are consistently applied across the garment’s gradient layers and floral patterns. The background also supports this theme, with blooming pink cherry blossoms and lush green foliage that complement the pastel tones. Such a color scheme is commonly used in stylized illustrations to evoke feelings of serenity, springtime, and delicacy. The absence of bold or saturated colors further confirms the dominance of pastel tones throughout the composition.",

      "question": "Does the hanbok display a smooth and vivid gradient effect, transitioning between multiple pastel hues with noticeable vibrancy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the hanbok in Image B exhibits a smooth gradient transition from one pastel hue to another. The fabric flows seamlessly from light blue to peach, pink, and lavender, creating a visually appealing and dynamic effect. This gradient is not abrupt but rather blended with precision, giving the impression of depth and movement. The vibrancy is enhanced through digital rendering techniques that make the colors pop while maintaining their softness. This kind of gradient effect is typical in modern digital art and animation, where gradients are used to add dimension and visual interest without overwhelming the viewer. The result is a luminous, almost ethereal appearance that emphasizes the elegance of the traditional attire.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of dense green foliage and clusters of pink blossoms, resembling cherry or plum trees in full bloom. This setting evokes a springtime garden scene, rich in natural beauty. The greenery provides a contrasting backdrop to the pastel-colored hanbok, enhancing its visual prominence. The flowers are evenly distributed and rendered with soft focus, contributing to a serene and picturesque atmosphere. This combination of vibrant green leaves and delicate pink petals creates a lively yet tranquil environment, consistent with traditional Korean cultural imagery associated with nature and harmony. The overall composition feels organic and immersive, reinforcing the sense of being in a peaceful outdoor space.",

      "question": "Is the image displayed inside a floral-decorated envelope with visible green vine accents around its border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene is framed within what appears to be a decorative envelope. The top left corner shows a portion of a cream-colored envelope adorned with a floral design featuring pink roses and green vines. Additionally, green vine-like elements extend from the corners of the frame, wrapping around the edges of the image. These vines serve as ornamental borders, adding to the postcard-like quality of the presentation. The presence of these botanical decorations suggests that the image is styled as if it were part of a letter or greeting card, emphasizing themes of warmth, nature, and personal connection. This framing device is not just decorative but also functional in guiding the viewer’s attention toward the central figure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B is clearly formatted to resemble a postcard. It includes a clean, balanced composition with a central portrait framed by decorative elements such as green vines and a floral envelope motif. The layout is symmetrical and well-proportioned, with ample white space and visual hierarchy that draws the eye to the subject. The inclusion of the envelope and vine borders mimics the style of vintage or modern illustrated postcards, often used in curated collections or scrapbooks. Furthermore, the high-quality rendering and cohesive color scheme suggest it is designed for display or sharing in a curated format. This type of formatting is typical for collectible art pieces intended for albums or digital galleries, where aesthetic consistency and thematic unity are important.",
