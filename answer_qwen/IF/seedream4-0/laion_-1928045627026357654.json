      "question": "Does the male character's tee have a plush 3D appearance with a bold geometric pattern and an enlarged collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the male character is depicted as a stylized figurine with exaggerated cartoonish features. His shirt appears to be made of a soft, textured material resembling plush fabric, giving it a three-dimensional, tactile quality. The shirt features a prominent diamond-shaped geometric pattern composed of contrasting colors (dark blue, white, and pink), which stands out boldly against the base color. Additionally, the collar is notably large and fluffy, extending outward in a way that suggests an enlarged, decorative design typical of plush or toy-like apparel. This combination of visual cues—plush texture, bold geometric design, and oversized collar—supports the conclusion that the tee matches the description.",

      "question": "Are the male character's pants rendered in a plush 3D style with a bold geometric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The male character's pants in Image B are clearly designed with a plush, soft-textured appearance consistent with the rest of his outfit. They feature diagonal stripes in alternating colors—white, dark blue, and pink—which form a bold geometric pattern across the legs. This pattern is visually striking and aligns with the same aesthetic as the shirt. The rendering gives the impression of depth and volume, reinforcing the 3D plush style. Given these observations, the pants match the description of being both plush and geometrically patterned.",

      "question": "Do the female character's high-waisted pants feature exaggerated, prominent pleats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The female character’s pants in Image B are high-waisted and cinched at the waist with a belt. At the bottom of the pants, there is a flared section with multiple vertical folds that resemble ruffles or pleats. These pleats are wide and pronounced, creating a dramatic silhouette that extends outward like a skirt. This design choice emphasizes volume and movement, which is characteristic of exaggerated fashion elements in stylized or chibi art forms. Therefore, the pants do indeed feature exaggerated, prominent pleats.",

      "question": "Is the sleeve of the female character's top visibly enlarged compared to normal proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The female character's top in Image B has long sleeves that appear significantly wider than typical human proportions. The sleeves are puffy and extend outward from the shoulders, tapering slightly toward the hands, which is a common stylistic feature in chibi or doll-like figures. This exaggerated width is not representative of real-world clothing but rather a deliberate artistic choice to enhance the cartoonish, playful aesthetic. Thus, the sleeves are visibly enlarged compared to normal proportions.",

      "question": "Are both characters rendered as chibi-style figurines with large heads, small bodies, and cartoonish proportions, dancing on a pastel-colored stage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B exhibit classic chibi-style traits: disproportionately large heads relative to their bodies, simplified facial features (large eyes, small mouths), and stylized limbs. Their overall proportions are cartoonish and exaggerated, typical of collectible figurines or animated characters. They are positioned mid-dance, with dynamic poses suggesting movement. The background includes a softly lit stage with pastel hues—pinks, purples, and light blues—creating a whimsical, dreamlike environment. This setting, combined with their design, confirms they are chibi-style figurines dancing on a pastel-colored stage.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The two characters in Image B are captured in mid-motion, with one arm extended and the other holding onto the partner, suggesting a synchronized dance routine. Their postures are fluid and balanced, indicative of gracefulness. Both characters display gentle smiles and bright eyes, contributing to joyful expressions. The stage beneath them is bathed in soft, pastel lighting with pink and purple tones, enhancing the whimsical and elegant atmosphere. Together, these elements—the dance poses, expressions, and setting—convey a sense of playful elegance, consistent with the description.",
