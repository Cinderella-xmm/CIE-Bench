      "question": "Does the image feature a stylized illustration of iconic kitchen items like a cream-hued stove, a retro fridge, and wooden utensils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image displays a vintage-style kitchen scene rendered in a stylized, illustrative manner. The stove is clearly depicted in a cream or off-white color, consistent with mid-20th-century design aesthetics. A retro refrigerator, also in a cream hue with silver handles, stands to the left of the stove. Wooden utensils are visible in a container on the counter to the right of the stove. These elements are simplified yet recognizable, indicating an artistic representation rather than a photograph. The overall style suggests a deliberate nostalgic aesthetic, typical of illustrations used in collectible cards or promotional materials from that era.",

      "question": "Does the card have a slightly worn paper texture and rounded edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The card’s border exhibits a textured surface resembling aged paper, with subtle discoloration and speckling that mimic wear and tear over time. The corners are visibly rounded, not sharp, which is characteristic of vintage or retro-styled cards designed to evoke a sense of nostalgia. This visual cue aligns with common design choices for collectible or commemorative cards meant to look antique or handcrafted.",

      "question": "Are the colors in the image muted and earthy, primarily consisting of beige, soft green, and brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dominant color palette includes warm beige tones for the appliances and cabinetry, complemented by a soft green hue on the side of the refrigerator, which adds a subtle contrast. Brown is present in the wooden utensils, floor tiles, and countertop accents. These colors are subdued and harmonious, creating a cozy, retro atmosphere. The use of such muted, earthy tones is consistent with mid-century interior design trends, reinforcing the vintage feel of the illustration.",

      "question": "Does the card have faint distressed markings and gentle shadows along its borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection, the edges of the card show light discoloration, small stains, and irregularities that resemble natural aging. These markings are subtle but noticeable, contributing to the vintage appearance. Additionally, there are soft shadows cast along the perimeter, suggesting depth and giving the impression that the card is resting on a surface under ambient lighting. These details enhance the tactile quality of the card and support the illusion of physical wear.",
