      "question": "Does the edited image include a visible brand name \"Earth Elegance\" on the packaging or product?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging is a black box with the text 'Earth Elegance' clearly printed in bronze-colored typography on both the top and front of the box. Additionally, the word 'Elegance' is visible on a small decal at the base of each vase inside the box, indicating branding consistency. This confirms that the brand name is present both on the packaging and on the product itself. The use of consistent branding across multiple surfaces suggests intentional marketing design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the texture of the vases been changed from clay to a marbled ceramic finish with visible veining and smooth surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two vases with a distinct marbled pattern featuring swirls of beige, cream, and brown tones, characteristic of a marbled ceramic finish. The surface appears smooth and polished, with visible veining that mimics natural stone. In contrast, Image A displays vases made of solid, matte yellow clay with a rougher, more organic texture resembling unglazed terracotta. The transformation from a raw clay appearance to a refined marbled ceramic finish indicates a significant change in material texture and visual appeal.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there subtle branding decals visible on the vases or packaging, such as logos or text related to \"Earth Elegance\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, small rectangular decals are visible on the base of each vase, bearing the word 'Elegance'—a clear reference to the brand name. These decals are discreetly placed and match the overall aesthetic. The packaging also features the full brand name 'Earth Elegance' in elegant typography. These elements indicate deliberate branding through subtle yet identifiable markings on both the product and its container.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible gold leaf accents applied to the vases, such as along the rim or petal edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals small, irregular patches of gold leaf adhered to the outer surface of the vases, particularly near the rim and along the edges of the sculpted artichoke-like patterns. These accents are not uniformly distributed but appear intentionally placed to enhance visual interest. Gold leaf is often used in luxury ceramics to add opulence, and its presence here aligns with the premium presentation of the product.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the packaging include a cross-sectional illustration of the vase interior showing the artichoke-like pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B does not contain any illustrations or diagrams. Instead, it displays the actual vases in a cut-out window, allowing a direct view of their interiors. The artichoke-like pattern is visible within the vases themselves due to their physical design, not through an illustrated representation. Therefore, while the interior pattern is shown, it is not via a cross-sectional illustration but through real-world visibility.",

      "question": "Is the packaging a matte black box with bronze-colored typography visible on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sleek, matte black box that houses the vases. The text 'Earth Elegance' is printed in a warm, metallic bronze color on both the top and front panels. The matte finish of the box contrasts with the glossy sheen of the typography, creating a sophisticated look. This combination of materials and colors is typical of high-end product packaging designed to convey elegance and quality.",

      "question": "Does the overall design convey craftsmanship and earthy aesthetics through materials, colors, and layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design in Image B emphasizes craftsmanship through intricate details such as the embossed artichoke pattern inside the vases, the marbled ceramic finish, and the delicate gold leaf accents. The color palette—comprising earthy beiges, browns, and creams—evokes a natural, organic feel. The minimalist black packaging with bronze lettering enhances the sense of refinement without overwhelming the product. Together, these elements reflect a thoughtful balance between natural inspiration and artisanal precision, strongly conveying both craftsmanship and earthy aesthetics.",
