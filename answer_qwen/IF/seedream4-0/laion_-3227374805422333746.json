      "question": "Is the house presented as a standalone collectible game asset, positioned as if part of a board game scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house is placed on a parchment-like surface that resembles a game board or map, with text and illustrations suggesting it's part of a tabletop game. The presence of miniature fantasy characters around the house and rule booklets nearby strongly indicates that this is not just a standalone asset but is integrated into a game context. This setup mimics how collectible game assets are often displayed in promotional materials for board games or tabletop RPGs. The overall composition suggests a curated scene designed to evoke gameplay, rather than a neutral presentation of an isolated object.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the colors of the house been changed to earthy tones such as browns, tans, and muted greens instead of bright reds and yellows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The roof tiles in Image B appear more subdued compared to the vibrant reds in the original image (Image A). They now have a more natural, weathered brownish-red hue, consistent with aged terracotta or wooden shingles. The walls and stone elements also exhibit a warmer, more earthy palette—browns, tans, and subtle greys—replacing the brighter yellows seen in the windows and other areas of the original. Additionally, moss and greenery are visible along the base, adding muted greens to the color scheme. These changes align with a shift toward earthy tones typical of rustic or fantasy game environments.",

      "question": "Is there visible moss texture applied to the base of the house, particularly along the foundation or lower walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, in Image B, patches of green moss are clearly visible along the foundation and lower walls of the house. This detail adds realism and aging to the structure, enhancing its integration into a fantasy setting. Moss growth is common in damp, outdoor environments and is frequently used in game art to suggest age and immersion. The moss appears textured and organic, contrasting with the clean, untextured base in the original image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have all stone textures (such as pillars and wall sections) been replaced with wooden plank textures showing visible grain and joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No, the stone textures remain intact in Image B. The pillars, corners, and parts of the foundation still feature grey stone blocks with clear masonry details. While some wooden beams and planks are present, especially in the framing and doorways, the stone elements have not been replaced. In fact, they are more prominent in this version due to the added moss and weathering effects. Therefore, the stone textures have not been replaced with wood; they are preserved and enhanced.",

      "question": "Are there at least one or more miniature fantasy characters (e.g., knight, wizard, dwarf) placed beside the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, three distinct miniature fantasy characters are visible to the left of the house in Image B. These figures include armored warriors and possibly a mage or rogue, each holding weapons such as swords and spears. Their design and scale match typical miniatures used in tabletop role-playing games. These characters are clearly placed within the scene to suggest gameplay interaction, reinforcing the idea that this is a game-related environment.",

      "question": "Is the text “Castle Quest” displayed on a parchment-style board located beneath the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the text 'Castle Quest' is prominently displayed in a stylized font on a large parchment-like surface beneath the house. The parchment has a vintage appearance with decorative borders and symbols, consistent with fantasy-themed game branding. This element serves as a title card or game board label, anchoring the scene within a specific game universe. The placement and design confirm that it is intentionally part of the game-themed presentation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, to the right of the house, several small folded papers are visible. These resemble rule booklets or game cards, with printed text, illustrations, and layout designs typical of game manuals. They are arranged in a stack, partially fanned out, which suggests they are meant to be read or referenced during gameplay. The level of detail, including readable titles and diagrams, supports their identification as functional game components.",
