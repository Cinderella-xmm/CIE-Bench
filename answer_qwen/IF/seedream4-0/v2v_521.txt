    "Question": "Q1: Does the image feature a stylized illustration of iconic kitchen items like a cream-hued stove, a retro fridge, and wooden utensils?",
    "explanation": "The image displays a vintage-style kitchen scene rendered in a stylized, illustrative manner. The stove is clearly depicted in a cream or off-white color, consistent with mid-20th-century design aesthetics. A retro refrigerator, also in a cream hue with silver handles, stands to the left of the stove. Wooden utensils are visible in a container on the counter to the right of the stove. These elements are simplified yet recognizable, indicating an artistic representation rather than a photograph. The overall style suggests a deliberate nostalgic aesthetic, typical of illustrations used in collectible cards or promotional materials from that era.",

    "Question": "Q4: Does the card have faint distressed markings and gentle shadows along its borders?",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection, the edges of the card show light discoloration, small stains, and irregularities that resemble natural aging. These markings are subtle but noticeable, contributing to the vintage appearance. Additionally, there are soft shadows cast along the perimeter, suggesting depth and giving the impression that the card is resting on a surface under ambient lighting.

    "Question": "Q5: Are there text elements in retro-style fonts placed in the top-left corner ('{{brand}}'), top-right corner ('{{product_name}}'), and at the bottom ('{{company_name}}' and '{{card_number}}')?",
    "explanation": "The card features placeholder text in distinct locations: ' {{brand}} ' in the top-left corner, ' productname ' in the top-right corner, and ' Company.name ' and ' card number ' at the bottom. The typography used is reminiscent of mid-20th-century designs—rounded, slightly ornate, and evocative of vintage branding. These placements follow a standard layout for collectible or promotional cards, where brand, product, and issuer information are clearly displayed. The use of curly braces around placeholders indicates this is a template intended for customization.",
