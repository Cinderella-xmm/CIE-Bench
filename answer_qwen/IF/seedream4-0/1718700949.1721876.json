      "question": "Is the elephant depicted as a smaller-scale version enclosed within a transparent glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is clearly positioned inside a transparent glass enclosure with visible framing and reflective surfaces, indicating it is displayed like a collectible or artifact. The scale of the elephant relative to the surrounding elements—such as the bonsai trees and the proportions of the display case—suggests it is a model or statue rather than a full-sized animal. This is further supported by the polished, static appearance of the figure and the controlled lighting typical of museum or exhibit displays. The presence of a glass case implies intentional preservation and presentation, which aligns with the concept of a smaller-scale representation. Therefore, based on visual cues such as the glass enclosure, proportionality, and display context, the elephant appears to be a scaled-down version in a display case.",

      "question": "Are the intricate armor details on the elephant rendered with a shiny, metallic-resin-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor on the elephant in Image B exhibits high reflectivity, smooth surfaces, and sharp highlights consistent with a metallic or resin-based material. The patterns are detailed and have a polished finish that catches light, suggesting a synthetic or crafted surface rather than natural fabric or organic material. The way light reflects off the armor’s edges and embossed designs indicates a non-porous, rigid texture typical of metal or high-quality resin used in collectibles. This is reinforced by the uniformity and precision of the design, which would be difficult to achieve with traditional textiles. Thus, the visual evidence supports the conclusion that the armor has a shiny, metallic-resin-like texture.",

      "question": "Are there four small golden banners made of silk-like material positioned at each corner of the glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, two golden banners are visible—one on the left and one on the right side of the glass display case. These banners hang from the top corners and appear to be made of a silky, reflective material, likely satin or silk. However, only two banners are present, not four. There are no visible banners at the back corners of the case. Therefore, while the material and placement of the banners match the description for two corners, the count does not meet the requirement of four. Based on this observation, the statement is incorrect.",

      "question": "Does the background feature multiple layers of mountains with translucent, soft-edged silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B shows a stylized mountain range composed of layered peaks that fade into the distance. These mountains have soft, blurred edges and a semi-transparent quality, especially noticeable in the mid-to-far background, giving them a painted or ethereal appearance. This aesthetic is common in decorative backdrops used in display cases to evoke depth without distracting from the central object. The translucency and gradient shading suggest an artistic rendering rather than a realistic landscape. Hence, the visual cues confirm the presence of multiple layers of mountains with translucent, soft-edged silhouettes.",

      "question": "Are there small, stylized bonsai-like trees placed along the foreground edges of the display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two small, carefully pruned trees resembling bonsai are positioned symmetrically at the front left and right corners of the display case base. They are planted in shallow pots with moss and rocks, consistent with traditional bonsai presentation. Their placement along the foreground edges enhances the aesthetic balance of the scene and frames the central elephant figure. The style and arrangement strongly suggest they are intended as decorative elements mimicking bonsai art. Therefore, the presence of these trees matches the description provided.",
