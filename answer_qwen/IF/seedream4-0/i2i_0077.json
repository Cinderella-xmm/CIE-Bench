        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror remains centrally positioned above the sink, maintaining its rectangular shape with a soft glowing border, consistent with its placement in Image A. The faucet is also in the same location—centered beneath the mirror—and retains its modern, minimalist design. The spatial relationship between the mirror, faucet, and sink has not changed. This suggests that the core functional layout of the vanity area has been preserved. Based on visual cues such as alignment, symmetry, and relative positioning, it is clear that no significant reconfiguration has occurred to the mirror or faucet setup. Therefore, the original layout has been retained.",

      "question": "Have the wall materials been changed to reflect classical Roman architectural aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the walls are now covered in white marble with gray veining, a material commonly associated with classical Roman architecture and luxury interiors inspired by ancient Rome. Marble was widely used in Roman baths, temples, and villas for its durability and aesthetic appeal. Additionally, decorative molding and ornamental friezes are visible along the wall’s lower section, further reinforcing the classical Roman style. In contrast, Image A features plain, matte gray walls without any ornamentation or luxurious finishes. The transformation from a minimalist, modern wall finish to one with marble and classical detailing indicates a deliberate shift toward Roman-inspired design elements. Thus, the wall materials have indeed been changed to reflect classical Roman aesthetics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting fixtures have been replaced with ornate, golden wall sconces that resemble classical torches, complete with flames. These fixtures evoke the appearance of ancient Roman candelabras or braziers, which were often used in public baths and grand homes. The warm glow and sculptural design align with Roman decorative traditions that emphasized opulence and drama. In contrast, Image A features simple pendant lights with exposed bulbs, typical of modern industrial design. The change from minimalist hanging bulbs to elaborate flame-like sconces represents a significant shift in lighting style, directly aligning with classical Roman aesthetics. Therefore, the lighting has been altered to reflect Roman architectural influences.",

      "question": "Has the plant decor been changed to match classical Roman architectural aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plant decor includes a white classical urn-style vase holding green foliage, placed on the left side of the vanity. This type of vase is reminiscent of Roman pottery and sculptures, often used in gardens and public spaces during antiquity. The plant itself appears to be an olive branch or similar Mediterranean flora, which was symbolic in Roman culture. On the windowsill, there is another potted plant in a stone pot, further emphasizing natural, rustic elements common in Roman design. In Image A, the plant decor consists of a dark vase with delicate white flowers, which leans more toward modern minimalism. The replacement of contemporary floral arrangements with classical urns and Mediterranean plants indicates a deliberate effort to align the decor with Roman aesthetics. Hence, the plant decor has been changed accordingly.",

      "question": "Does the overall scene now feature elements typical of a Roman-style bathhouse, such as columns, arches, or frescoes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B incorporates several Roman-inspired elements—such as marble walls, classical sconces, and urn-shaped planters—it does not include structural features like columns, arches, or frescoes. Columns and arches are defining architectural components of Roman bathhouses (e.g., thermae), but none are present in this space. The ceiling remains flat and unadorned, lacking frescoed artwork or coffered designs typical of Roman interiors. The window frame and overall room structure remain modern and rectilinear. Although the aesthetic is Roman-influenced, the absence of key architectural elements like columns or arches means the scene does not fully embody a Roman-style bathhouse. Therefore, while the design draws inspiration from Roman aesthetics, it does not feature the hallmark structural elements of such spaces.",
