      "question": "Is the cathedral and surrounding square depicted at a significantly reduced scale, consistent with a miniature model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral appears to be rendered in a highly stylized manner, with exaggerated proportions and smooth textures that resemble sculpted material such as resin or wax. The human figures in the foreground are disproportionately small compared to the building, suggesting a scaled-down representation. Furthermore, the entire scene is enclosed within a large ornate frame, which reinforces the idea that this is not a real-world depiction but rather a display of a model. The lighting and shadows also appear artificial and uniform, typical of indoor dioramas or museum exhibits. These visual cues—combined with common knowledge about how miniature models are presented—strongly suggest that the cathedral and square are depicted at a significantly reduced scale.",

      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within an ornate, decorative frame featuring baroque-style architectural details such as scrolls, columns, or intricate carvings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the cathedral and its surroundings framed by a large, richly decorated wooden structure. The frame features elaborate carvings, including scrolls, floral motifs, and symmetrical ornamentation characteristic of Baroque design. These elements are consistent with traditional museum display cases used for historical or cultural artifacts. The frame extends beyond the image boundaries and includes glass panels, further indicating it is a physical enclosure designed to showcase the scene. This matches well-known examples of historical dioramas or architectural models displayed in museums.",

      "question": "Are there small-scale human figures present in the square, wearing detailed historical or formal attire, and positioned as if walking or strolling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, numerous tiny human figures are visible in the square in front of the cathedral. They are proportionally much smaller than the building, reinforcing the idea of a model. Their clothing varies in style, with some appearing in colorful, possibly traditional or historical garments, such as long dresses and hats. Their postures suggest movement—some are walking, others standing in groups—as if engaged in casual activity. This level of detail in attire and pose is typical of carefully crafted miniature figures used in dioramas to simulate life-like scenes. Given the context of a museum-style display, these figures are likely intentional representations of people from a past era.",

      "question": "Is the cathedral façade uniformly colored in a warm beige tone and visually textured to resemble resin rather than natural stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cathedral in Image B has a consistent, smooth surface texture and a warm, golden-beige coloration that lacks the natural variation and weathering seen in real stone buildings. The surface appears slightly glossy and homogenous, which is characteristic of materials like resin or plaster used in modeling. In contrast to the rough, irregular texture of actual limestone or sandstone, this façade looks artificially manufactured. Additionally, the absence of shadow depth and subtle imperfections supports the conclusion that it is not real stone but a modeled replica. This aligns with common practices in creating architectural models where materials mimic appearance without replicating true texture.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, vintage-style lamps placed around the scene emitting a soft, dim, warm glow consistent with antique lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several small lamp posts are visible in front of the cathedral, symmetrically positioned on either side of the central entrance. These lamps have classic designs with glass shades and metal bases, resembling gaslight or early electric streetlamps from the 19th century. They emit a warm, yellowish light that casts soft glows on the ground and nearby surfaces, contributing to a nostalgic ambiance. The lighting effect is consistent with indoor illumination used in museum displays to enhance mood and visibility. This matches known examples of vintage-style lighting used in dioramas to simulate historical settings.",

      "question": "Is there a visible engraved plaque on the display case containing text identifying the cathedral and its history?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the base of the display case in Image B, there is a prominent rectangular plaque with engraved text. Although the words are not fully legible due to resolution, the presence of formal script and structured layout suggests it contains descriptive information about the cathedral. Plaques like this are standard in museum exhibits to provide context, origin, and historical significance. The placement and design—centered below the scene and framed by decorative elements—are typical of informational signage in curated displays. Therefore, based on visual evidence and common exhibit practices, a plaque identifying the cathedral and its history is present.",

      "question": "Is the background of the scene a painted depiction of a vibrant sky, with visible color gradients and cloud formations, framed by a soft vignette effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background behind the cathedral in Image B is not a photograph of a real sky but a painted backdrop. It features dramatic color gradients transitioning from deep blue to orange and red hues, simulating a sunset or sunrise. Cloud formations are stylized and artistically rendered, lacking photorealistic detail. The edges of the sky appear softly blurred or darkened, creating a vignette effect that draws focus toward the center of the scene. This technique is commonly used in dioramas to create depth and atmosphere. The painted nature of the sky contrasts sharply with the clear, unobstructed blue sky in Image A, confirming it is an artistic addition rather than a real environment.",
