      "question": "Has the jeans been transformed into a perfume bottle shape that maintains the flared leg silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is clearly a perfume bottle designed to resemble a pair of jeans. The overall shape mimics the form of flared-leg jeans, with the legs extending outward in a bell-bottom style, consistent with the silhouette seen in typical flared jeans. The structure of the bottle follows the contour of denim pants, including the waistband and hip area, and continues down into the flared lower legs. This design choice preserves the iconic flared leg shape while transforming it into a functional glass container. The transformation is not merely superficial—it integrates the aesthetic of jeans into the form of a bottle, maintaining key visual elements such as the flare. Thus, based on visual cues and common design principles in novelty bottles, the jeans' silhouette has indeed been preserved in the bottle’s shape.",

      "question": "Is the bottle made of transparent glass tinted with denim blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottle in Image B is constructed from clear, transparent glass, which allows visibility through its structure. However, the surface of the glass is decorated with a printed or applied denim texture that gives the appearance of blue jeans. This includes details like stitching, fading, and fabric patterns typical of denim. The glass itself is not tinted blue; instead, the denim look is achieved through surface design rather than coloration of the material. This is evident because light passes through the glass, and the interior is visible, confirming transparency. Therefore, while the bottle appears blue due to the denim-like finish, the glass remains untinted.",

      "question": "Have the back pockets been replaced with embossed metallic branding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the back of the bottle in Image B, there are two pocket-like structures that mimic the back pockets of jeans. These pockets feature embroidered-style text: 'Liant' on the left and 'Ikana' on the right. These inscriptions appear to be printed or stitched onto the surface rather than being embossed or metallic. There is no visible raised texture or reflective metallic finish suggesting embossing. Instead, the branding is integrated into the fabric-like surface design, resembling embroidery commonly found on branded jeans. Therefore, the pockets have not been replaced with embossed metallic branding but rather feature printed or simulated embroidery.",

      "question": "Is there a silver button-style cap at the top of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the bottle in Image B, there is a rounded, polished metallic cap that resembles a button. Its shiny, reflective surface and spherical shape strongly suggest it is made of metal, likely chrome or stainless steel, and is styled to look like a large button—commonly used in fashion accessories or novelty designs. This cap sits atop the neck of the bottle and functions as a closure. Given its appearance and placement, it matches the description of a silver button-style cap. This design choice aligns with the jeans theme, where buttons are typically found on the front of jeans, and here they are stylized for the bottle's aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are lace-up details present along the side of the bottle, matching the position of the original jeans' laces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side of the bottle features a series of crisscrossed laces that extend from the upper thigh area down toward the ankle, ending in a bow. These laces are positioned along the outer seam of the right leg, mirroring the lace-up detail seen in the original jeans (Image A). The lacing pattern and placement are consistent with the design of the jeans, suggesting a direct translation of that feature into the bottle's decoration. The laces appear to be part of the surface design, possibly printed or attached, but their positioning and style match the original jeans’ lace-up element. Therefore, the lace-up details are present and accurately aligned with the original jeans’ design.",
