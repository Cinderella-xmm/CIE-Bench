      "question": "Is the image now a whimsical comic illustration rather than a formal diagram?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is clearly styled as a whimsical, cartoon-like illustration featuring anthropomorphic animals in a forest setting, each representing a step in the data journey. The use of playful characters, vibrant colors, and storybook elements such as a banner and speech bubbles indicates a shift from a formal, technical diagram to a lighthearted, narrative-driven visual. This style is designed to make the concept of data science more approachable and engaging, especially for younger or non-technical audiences. In contrast to the original image (Image A), which is a clean, black-and-white circular flowchart with labeled boxes and arrows, this version uses storytelling and humor to convey the same information. Therefore, it is no longer a formal diagram but a whimsical comic-style illustration.",

      "question": "Is there a wise owl wearing glasses positioned in the Business Understanding section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one of the owls is indeed depicted wearing glasses and is located on a rock labeled 'Business Understanding'. This owl appears scholarly and observant, fitting the role of a wise figure who interprets business goals. The presence of glasses reinforces the idea of analytical thinking, aligning with the 'Business Understanding' phase where objectives are defined. This contrasts with Image A, where 'Business Understanding' is simply a text box without any character representation. Thus, the owl with glasses is a creative addition to personify that stage.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the connections between processes represented by playful paths like stepping stones or bridges instead of arrows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Instead of using traditional arrows to indicate the flow between stages, Image B employs a whimsical path made of stepping stones connected by wooden bridges leading toward a central treasure chest. These elements symbolize the journey through the data process, making the transitions visually engaging and metaphorical. This replaces the direct, linear arrows seen in Image A, which represent a more rigid, technical workflow. The use of natural pathways enhances the storybook theme and makes the progression feel more exploratory and imaginative.",

      "question": "Is the central \"Data\" element replaced with a glowing pile of data crystals, surrounded and guarded by all characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the center of Image B, there is a large treasure chest filled with glowing blue crystals and acorns, symbolizing valuable data. This central element emits light and is placed at the convergence point of all character paths, suggesting it is the core of the data journey. Surrounding it are various animals—owls, foxes, deer, raccoons—each engaged in different roles related to data processing. While not explicitly 'guarding', they are positioned around it as if contributing to its collection and refinement. This replaces the simple database icon ('Data') in Image A, transforming it into a magical, symbolic representation of data as a precious resource.",

      "question": "Is there a banner at the top of the image with the text “The Adventures of Data Journey!”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the very top of Image B, a golden ribbon-style banner stretches across the scene with the bold, playful text 'The Adventures of Data Journey!'. This title sets a narrative tone, framing the entire process as an adventure. It is clearly visible and stylistically consistent with the overall cartoon aesthetic. In contrast, Image A has no such banner—it is purely functional and lacks any decorative or thematic text beyond the labels. Therefore, this banner is a new, creative addition that enhances the storytelling aspect.",

      "question": "Does each character have a speech bubble with a humorous line describing their role in the data journey?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Two characters in Image B have speech bubbles containing humorous lines: the cat in the 'Preparation' stage says 'I dig data acorns!', and the deer in the 'Evaluation' stage repeats the same phrase. These lines playfully reference data mining and preparation, using puns ('dig' and 'acorns') to describe data extraction. However, not all characters have speech bubbles—the owl, fox, and raccoon do not. Therefore, while some characters have humorous commentary, it is not universal across all. This suggests the feature is partially implemented, but not fully applied to every character.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is rich in color, featuring vibrant greens, blues, yellows, and earth tones that create a cheerful, animated forest environment. The art style resembles children’s book illustrations, with soft outlines, expressive characters, and exaggerated features. Elements like the glowing crystals, cartoon animals in suits, and whimsical paths reinforce a storybook atmosphere. This contrasts sharply with Image A, which is monochrome and minimalistic, focusing on clarity over aesthetics. The choice of bright colors and stylized visuals supports an educational yet entertaining purpose.",

      "question": "Does the image maintain a 3:4 aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual inspection, Image B appears to be vertically oriented, with a height greater than its width. The layout includes a wide banner at the top and a central vertical pathway leading down, suggesting a taller-than-wide format. The proportions seem closer to a 3:4 or even 4:5 ratio, commonly used in portrait-oriented illustrations or digital cards. While exact pixel dimensions are not provided, the visual balance and composition support a 3:4 aspect ratio. In comparison, Image A appears to be square or nearly square, possibly 1:1, due to its symmetrical circular design. Therefore, Image B likely adheres to a 3:4 aspect ratio, typical for illustrated posters or educational graphics.",
