      "question": "Are expressive faces and limbs added to the cookies to make them anthropomorphic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several cookies have been digitally or physically modified to include cartoon-like facial features such as eyes, eyebrows, and mouths. Additionally, small brown appendages resembling arms and legs are attached to some of the cookies, giving them a human-like appearance. These modifications transform the otherwise plain cookies into anthropomorphic characters. This is consistent with common creative food photography techniques where objects are personified for visual storytelling. The addition of facial expressions and limbs clearly indicates an intent to anthropomorphize the cookies.",

      "question": "Does the image include at least one cookie with a grinning expression, one with a pouting expression, and one with a winking expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the facial expressions on the cookies in Image B: one cookie outside the cup has a wide smile with curved eyes, indicating a grinning expression. Another cookie inside the cup has a downturned mouth and one eye closed, suggesting a pouting or sad expression. However, there is no cookie that clearly displays a winking expression (one eye closed, the other open). Instead, the 'winking' cookie appears to have both eyes closed, which is more indicative of sleepiness or sadness than a wink. Therefore, while two of the three expressions are present, the third (winking) is not accurately depicted. Based on this observation, the answer must be 'No'.",

      "question": "Is there a tea party scene depicted, including props such as a tiny tea table or teacups?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a miniature setup that mimics a tea party. A small round table is placed in front of the cookies, with a tiny teapot and teacup set arranged on it. These items are scaled down to match the size of the cookies, suggesting a whimsical, imaginative tea party. Additionally, two tiny wooden chairs are positioned near the cup, further reinforcing the tea party theme. This setup is consistent with staged food photography meant to evoke a playful narrative. The presence of these detailed props confirms the depiction of a tea party scene.",

      "question": "Has the cup been modified to resemble a clubhouse, such as having windows, doors, or other architectural details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white speckled cup in Image B remains largely unchanged from its original form. It does not feature any added architectural elements like windows, doors, or roof structures that would suggest it has been transformed into a clubhouse. While the cup serves as a container for the cookies and is part of the whimsical scene, it lacks any structural modifications that would classify it as a building or clubhouse. Its role is purely functional and aesthetic within the context of the scene, not architectural.",

      "question": "Has the pink plate been replaced with a floral-patterned picnic blanket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the cup and cookies is no longer the solid pink plate seen in Image A. Instead, it is a fabric with a floral pattern—featuring roses and leaves—bordered with blue trim, resembling a miniature picnic blanket. This blanket is laid over the original striped cloth and serves as the base for the tea party scene. The change from a plate to a blanket is significant and intentional, enhancing the whimsical, outdoor picnic theme. Therefore, the pink plate has indeed been replaced by a floral-patterned blanket.",
