      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the core visual elements of Image A in the form of a glow-in-the-dark wall sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork displayed on the wall closely resembles Vincent van Gogh's 'Starry Night,' which is known for its swirling night sky, prominent cypress tree, and glowing celestial bodies. The key elements such as the crescent moon, radiant stars, swirling clouds, and the village below are all present and positioned similarly to the original painting. The style, including the thick brushstrokes and color palette, is preserved, suggesting that the wall sticker is a faithful reproduction of the original artwork. Given that the image shows a large-scale version of the painting applied directly to a wall, it is reasonable to infer that this is a wall sticker designed to replicate the original. Therefore, the core visual elements of Image A have been maintained.",

      "question": "Is the glow-in-the-dark effect visible on the wall sticker depiction, indicating that it would illuminate in dark conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the wall sticker emitting a soft, luminous glow, particularly noticeable in the stars, moon, and swirling patterns of the sky. This glow appears to be emanating from the sticker itself, suggesting that it has photoluminescent properties. In real-world applications, glow-in-the-dark materials absorb light during the day and emit it in darkness, which is consistent with what is visually depicted here. The ambient lighting in the room is dim, yet the sticker still appears bright, especially in areas like the stars and moon, reinforcing the idea that it is designed to glow. Thus, the glow-in-the-dark effect is visibly demonstrated in the image.",

      "question": "Is the wall sticker shown being applied to a feature wall in a bedroom setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a bed with two pillows and two bedside tables, each with a lamp, clearly indicating a bedroom environment. The wall behind the bed features the large 'Starry Night' artwork, which dominates the space and serves as a focal point. This central placement, combined with the size and prominence of the artwork, suggests that it is intended as a feature wall decoration. Feature walls are commonly used in bedrooms to create a dramatic or artistic ambiance, and the positioning of the sticker aligns with typical interior design practices. Therefore, the sticker is indeed shown applied to a feature wall within a bedroom setting.",

      "question": "Does the bedroom setting appear logically consistent and appropriate for the placement of the glow-in-the-dark wall sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bedroom setting includes standard furnishings such as a bed, pillows, and bedside lamps, which are typical in residential spaces. The use of a glow-in-the-dark wall sticker in a bedroom is both logical and practical, as such stickers are often chosen for their aesthetic appeal and ability to provide ambient lighting in low-light conditions. The sticker's placement above the bed enhances the room’s atmosphere, especially at night when the glow effect would be most visible. This application aligns with common consumer preferences for decorative and functional wall art in bedrooms. Hence, the setting is consistent and appropriate for the sticker's use.",

      "question": "Has the artistic style and aesthetic of Image A been preserved in the wall sticker design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall sticker in Image B replicates the distinctive post-impressionist style of Vincent van Gogh’s 'Starry Night.' Key stylistic features such as the swirling brushwork, vibrant color contrasts (especially blues, yellows, and greens), and expressive forms are faithfully reproduced. The cypress tree, the dynamic sky, and the village below retain their original proportions and compositional balance. While there may be slight differences in texture due to the medium (a printed sticker vs. oil on canvas), the overall aesthetic — including emotional intensity and visual rhythm — remains intact. This preservation indicates that the artist's intent and visual language have been respected in the design of the sticker.",
