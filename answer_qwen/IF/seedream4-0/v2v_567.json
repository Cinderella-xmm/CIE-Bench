      "question": "Have the individuals waiting at the train station been converted into 3D chibi-style characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individuals on the platform are depicted with exaggerated, simplified proportions typical of chibi-style characters—such as large heads, small bodies, and stylized facial features. These characters also exhibit smooth, rounded surfaces and consistent lighting that suggest a 3D rendering rather than a 2D illustration or realistic depiction. The visual cues, including the uniformity in character design and the use of shading to imply depth, align with common characteristics of 3D chibi models used in animation and video games. This transformation is clearly intentional and stylistic, differing from realistic human representation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the 3D chibi-style characters in the same positions as the original individuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing the relative positioning of the figures in Image A and Image B, it can be observed that the chibi-style characters maintain similar spatial arrangements along the platform. For instance, the person holding a suitcase stands near the edge of the platform in both images, and the group of people appears clustered in the same general area. Although their proportions and details have changed, their placement relative to each other and to the train station remains consistent. This suggests that the conversion to chibi style preserved the original composition’s layout for continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style characters retain the original outfits and postures of the individuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the chibi characters wear clothing that corresponds in color and style to the original outfits (e.g., hats, coats, dresses), the garments are simplified and stylized to fit the chibi aesthetic. For example, the folds and textures of fabric are minimized, and accessories like hats are proportionally larger. Postures are also preserved in a generalized way—such as standing upright or facing the train—but with exaggerated simplicity. However, fine details such as hand positions or subtle body language are lost due to the stylization. Thus, while the essence of attire and stance is retained, the fidelity to the original is reduced by artistic abstraction.",

      "question": "Has the train and station backdrop remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train, station building, tracks, surrounding vegetation, and sky in Image B appear visually identical to those in Image A. The steam plume, architectural details of the brick building, roofline, windows, and even the lighting conditions are consistent between both images. There is no visible alteration to the environment or background elements. This indicates that only the human figures were modified, while the rest of the scene was preserved exactly as in the original, likely to maintain context and realism around the stylized characters.",

      "question": "Do the chibi-style characters display 3D qualities like depth and shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style characters in Image B exhibit clear signs of 3D rendering, including smooth gradients, soft shadows, and highlights that suggest volume and form. For example, light appears to fall consistently across their bodies, creating depth through shading on their faces, clothes, and hats. Additionally, the edges of their forms are not flat but have subtle curvature and contouring, indicating modeling in three dimensions. These visual cues distinguish them from 2D cartoon characters and confirm they possess 3D qualities.",
