      "question": "Does the edited image display a dynamic pop-art comic design throughout the hospital setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features exaggerated outlines, vibrant colors, and stylized elements typical of pop-art and comic book aesthetics. The background includes dynamic visual effects such as a yellow burst with jagged edges, reminiscent of comic book sound effects or action highlights. Additionally, the use of bold lines and simplified forms across the entire scene—such as the nurse, patient, IV bag, and monitors—indicates a consistent application of comic-style rendering. These visual cues align with the characteristics of pop-art comics, where scenes are often dramatized and stylized for impact. This artistic treatment extends to all elements in the hospital environment, transforming the realistic clinical setting into a graphic narrative space.",

      "question": "Are halftone patterns visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Halftone patterns are a hallmark of traditional print-based comic art, used to simulate shading and texture through small dots of varying density. In the edited image, these patterns are clearly visible in multiple areas: the skin tones of the patient and nurse, the shadows on the bed and equipment, and even the background wall. These dot matrices create gradients and depth without continuous tone, which is characteristic of halftone printing techniques. The presence of such patterns confirms that the image has been processed with a comic book filter that mimics vintage print media, reinforcing its pop-art style.",

      "question": "Does the edited image incorporate striking, vivid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uses highly saturated and contrasting colors, particularly in the blue IV fluid, the nurse’s scrubs, and the red-orange burst in the background. These colors stand out sharply against the more neutral tones of the hospital room, creating a visually intense and dramatic effect. Such color choices are typical of pop-art and comic book illustrations, where bold hues are used to capture attention and convey energy. Compared to a realistic medical scene, this version emphasizes emotional and visual impact over naturalism, confirming the use of vivid coloring as a stylistic choice.",

      "question": "Are there bold graphical details present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Bold graphical details are evident throughout the edited image, including thick black outlines around figures and objects (e.g., the patient’s face, the nurse’s arms, the IV bag), exaggerated facial features, and stylized text on the monitors and IV label. The use of sharp contrasts between solid colors and black lines enhances clarity and drama, which is common in comic art. Even the textures on clothing and bedding are rendered with strong directional lines and defined shapes, contributing to a sense of visual dynamism. These elements collectively establish a strong, graphic aesthetic that distinguishes it from a photographic representation.",

      "question": "Has the original scene composition been maintained in the edited image despite the style change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout and spatial relationships in the edited image closely mirror those in the original: the patient remains lying in bed with an IV connected to his arm, the nurse stands beside him attending to equipment, and the monitors are positioned on the wall behind the bed. All key elements—the IV pole, medical cart, and bedside setup—are preserved in their relative positions. While the artistic style has shifted dramatically to a pop-art comic format, the overall composition, perspective, and narrative structure remain consistent with the original. This suggests that the transformation was applied as a stylistic overlay rather than a structural reorganization.",
