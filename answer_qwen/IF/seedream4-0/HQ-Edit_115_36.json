      "question": "Is the image formatted as a digital character card with a structured layout resembling an RPG collectible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image features a central illustration of a cat, surrounded by decorative elements such as a metallic border, stat bars, and text labels. These components are arranged in a symmetrical, organized manner typical of collectible character cards found in role-playing games (RPGs) or digital trading card games. The presence of attributes like 'Agility', 'Curiosity', and 'Charm' with numerical values further reinforces this format. Additionally, the use of ornate framing, banners, and nameplates is consistent with the design language of digital collectibles. Based on these visual cues and common design patterns in digital RPG media, the image clearly functions as a stylized character card.",

      "question": "Is the name 'Solara the Watcher' displayed on a sleek nameplate at the bottom of the card?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of the image, there is a horizontal, silver-colored plaque with rounded ends and rivet-like details that resemble a nameplate. The text 'Solara the Watcher' is clearly inscribed on it in a bold, serif font. This placement and design are consistent with how names are typically presented on collectible cards—centered and framed for emphasis. The nameplate's sleek appearance and integration into the overall border structure confirm its function as a formal identifier within the card’s layout.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cat and surrounding elements exhibit a semi-realistic 3D art style with a soft, polished finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat is rendered with detailed fur textures, realistic lighting, and subtle depth cues that suggest a three-dimensional form. However, the edges are slightly smoothed, and the colors are rich yet harmonious, giving the artwork a polished, illustrative quality rather than photorealism. This blend of realism and stylization is characteristic of semi-realistic 3D art often used in digital collectibles and animated media. The window, curtains, and wooden floor also share this aesthetic—realistic enough to be recognizable but refined with soft gradients and clean highlights. This artistic choice enhances visual appeal while maintaining clarity and thematic consistency.",

      "question": "Are the stat bars [Agility +9], [Curiosity +10], and [Charm +8] visibly present on the card?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the left side of the image, there are three horizontal bars aligned vertically. Each bar has a label and a corresponding numerical value: 'Agility +9', 'Curiosity +10', and 'Charm +8'. These bars are styled with color-coded fills (orange, green, blue respectively) and progress indicators, which are standard conventions in game UI design for representing character attributes. Their placement and formatting match typical RPG stat displays, making them clearly identifiable and readable.",

      "question": "Is there a golden-colored banner located at the top of the card?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top center of the image, there is a ribbon-shaped banner with a golden hue and slight sheen, displaying the text 'Solara the Watcher'. The banner is draped over the upper frame and features decorative folds and shadows that give it a three-dimensional appearance. Its placement and color are consistent with traditional heraldic or collectible card design, where such banners are used to highlight the character's name or title. The golden tone adds a sense of prestige, reinforcing its role as a prominent element.",

      "question": "Is the entire card surrounded by a metallic trim border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outer edge of the image is enclosed by a highly detailed, silver-toned border with rounded corners, ornamental corner caps, and embossed patterns that resemble metalwork. This border frames the entire composition, including the cat, window scene, and stat bars. The reflective highlights and structural design suggest a metallic material, commonly used in digital collectible cards to convey durability and elegance. The consistent thickness and intricate detailing across all sides confirm that this is a full-frame metallic trim.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background behind the cat features a multi-paned window with white frames, through which a bright blue sky is visible. There are faint clouds and distant rooftops, suggesting an urban or suburban setting during daytime. The lighting is soft and natural, casting gentle reflections on the floor and illuminating the cat’s fur, contributing to a calm and peaceful ambiance. This matches the description of a tranquil atmosphere and aligns with the original image’s setting, confirming continuity in environment and mood.",
