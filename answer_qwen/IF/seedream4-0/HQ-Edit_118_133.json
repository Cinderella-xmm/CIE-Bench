      "question": "Has the teapot been transformed into a candle design, with the overall object now resembling a candle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object retains the general shape of a teapot but has undergone significant transformation. The top of the object now features a flat surface with a visible wick extending upward, which is characteristic of a candle. The lighting and glow suggest an internal light source, typical of a lit candle. Additionally, the object is labeled 'Eternal Elegance Candle,' reinforcing its identity as a candle. While it maintains the form of a teapot, its function and appearance have been reimagined to resemble a candle. This transformation aligns with common design practices where functional objects are repurposed into decorative items like candles.",

      "question": "Is the body of the object now rendered with a transparent or translucent glass-like finish consistent with a candle base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the object in Image B appears opaque and solid, with a smooth, matte white surface that reflects light softly. There is no indication of transparency or translucency; instead, the material looks like porcelain or ceramic, commonly used for decorative candle holders. Glass-like finishes typically show refraction, clarity, or reflections that suggest depth and see-through properties, none of which are present here. Therefore, the material does not exhibit a glass-like quality.",

      "question": "Does the surface of the object exhibit a high-gloss ceramic finish instead of a metallic one?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the object in Image B has a smooth, creamy white texture with soft highlights that suggest a polished ceramic or porcelain material. Unlike the reflective, silvery sheen seen in metallic surfaces (as observed in Image A), this object lacks sharp reflections and instead shows a more diffused light response, typical of glazed ceramics. The intricate embossed patterns also appear slightly raised and non-reflective, further supporting a ceramic rather than metallic finish. Thus, the surface exhibits a high-gloss ceramic finish.",

      "question": "Has the spout been replaced with a visible wick extending from the top of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spout remains intact and clearly visible on the right side of the object in Image B. It maintains its original curved shape and decorative detailing. However, at the top center of the object, there is a thin, upright wick protruding from what appears to be a flat, open top. This wick is consistent with candle design and is not part of the spout. Therefore, while the spout itself has not been replaced, a wick has been added to the top, indicating a candle transformation.",

      "question": "Has the handle been transformed into a decorative gold accent rather than retaining its original functional form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle in Image B still follows the same curved, ergonomic shape as a traditional teapot handle, suggesting functionality. However, it is now accented with gold-colored detailing along its edges and joints, giving it a luxurious, ornamental appearance. The main structure of the handle remains intact and functional, but the addition of gold elements enhances its aesthetic appeal. This indicates that while the handle has been embellished, it has not been fully transformed into a purely decorative element.",

      "question": "Is there a subtle floral pattern visible around the base of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom edge of the object in Image B, just above the foot, there is a delicate band featuring small pink flowers and green leaves arranged in a repeating pattern. This floral motif is consistent with traditional decorative ceramics and adds a refined touch to the design. The pattern is subtle yet clearly visible under the lighting conditions, distinguishing it from plain or unadorned bases. Therefore, a floral pattern is indeed present.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Eternal Elegance Candle\" written in elegant script on the front of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Eternal Elegance Candle' is visible in the lower portion of Image B, positioned on the wooden surface in front of the object. It is written in a flowing, cursive script with a golden hue that matches the decorative accents of the object. However, the text is not physically inscribed on the object itself but rather overlaid as a label or caption beneath it. Therefore, while the text is present and stylistically elegant, it is not written on the front of the object.",
