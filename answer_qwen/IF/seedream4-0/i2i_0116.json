      "question": "Does the figurine match the characterâ€™s appearance and pose from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine depicts a character with long dark hair, wearing a black and green outfit with gold accents, including shoulder armor and arm bracers. The pose shows arms crossed over the chest, which matches the posture seen in Image A. The facial features, including the eyes, nose, and mouth, are highly detailed and closely resemble those of the character in Image A. The costume design, including the color scheme and structural elements like the collar and sleeves, is consistent between both images. Based on visual cues and common knowledge of character representations in collectibles, it is clear that the figurine is a faithful reproduction of the character's appearance and pose from the original image.",

      "question": "Is the figurine enclosed within a transparent display box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is clearly surrounded by a transparent, rectangular structure made of acrylic or glass, which is typical for display cases used to protect collectible items. The edges of the box are visible, and reflections on the surfaces confirm its transparency. This type of enclosure is commonly used to showcase figurines while preventing dust and physical damage. Therefore, based on the visual evidence, the figurine is indeed enclosed within a transparent display box.",

      "question": "Is the transparent display box placed on top of a desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the transparent display box rests on a flat, light-colored surface that has the appearance of a desk. Additional objects such as a keyboard and what appears to be a computer monitor are visible in the background, which are typical items found on a desk. The height and angle of the setup suggest it is positioned on a standard work surface. Given these contextual clues and common office or home workspace arrangements, it is reasonable to conclude that the display box is placed on a desk.",

      "question": "Is the background behind the desk a plain white wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The area behind the desk in Image B is uniformly white and lacks any visible patterns, decorations, or textures. There are no shadows or irregularities that would suggest the presence of other colors or materials. This plainness is consistent with a standard painted wall, often used in indoor settings for simplicity and neutrality. Combined with the absence of any distinct features or objects on the wall, it can be concluded that the background is a plain white wall.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No\n```",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, several additional elements are visible beyond the main components mentioned. These include a keyboard on the left side of the desk, part of a computer monitor on the right, and a power adapter or small electronic device near the back left corner. These items are not part of the primary subject (the figurine) or its immediate display setup but are present in the scene. Therefore, based on visual evidence, there are indeed additional elements in the image.",
