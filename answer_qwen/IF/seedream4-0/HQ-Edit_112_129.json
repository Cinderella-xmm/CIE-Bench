      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is clearly surrounded by a large, curved, transparent structure that covers it entirely from above. This structure has the appearance of a glass dome, commonly used in display cases to protect and showcase objects. The transparency allows full visibility of the teapot and its surroundings, including the plants and butterflies inside. Based on visual cues such as reflections, light refraction, and the rounded shape, this is consistent with a glass dome. The presence of a wooden base beneath the dome further supports the idea of a curated display setup. Therefore, the teapot is indeed enclosed within a transparent glass dome.",

      "question": "Is the teapot positioned on a vintage-style wooden base with a visible soft velvet lining underneath?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the teapot rests on a circular platform made of dark wood with visible grain patterns and ornate edges, suggesting a vintage or antique design. Beneath the teapot, there is a soft, plush material in a muted pinkish-brown tone that appears to be velvet or a similar fabric, serving as a cushioned liner. This combination of a wooden base and soft lining is typical of display stands used to protect delicate items. The texture and color of the fabric contrast gently with the metallic sheen of the teapot, reinforcing the impression of a carefully curated presentation. Thus, both elements—the vintage-style wooden base and the soft velvet lining—are present.",

      "question": "Are there tiny flowering plants and ferns visibly growing from the spout and lid of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, green stems with small flowers and fern-like leaves are emerging from the spout and the top of the teapot's lid. These botanical elements appear natural and are integrated into the composition as if they are growing directly from the metal surface. The positioning—especially from the spout and near the finial on the lid—suggests intentional artistic placement to create a surreal, nature-meets-artifact effect. The details of the flowers and fronds are sharp and realistic, indicating they are not just decorative additions but are meant to be perceived as living plants sprouting from the teapot. Therefore, yes, such plants are visibly growing from those areas.",

      "question": "Are there small butterflies visible, hovering near the floral engravings on the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two small butterflies can be seen within the glass dome. One is located near the right side of the teapot, close to the handle, while another is slightly higher, near the top right area of the dome. They appear to be fluttering mid-air, with wings spread, and their positioning suggests they are hovering around the teapot. While they are not directly touching the floral engravings, they are in close proximity to the upper portion of the teapot where the detailed carvings are located. Given their size, coloration (orange and black), and flight posture, they resemble real butterflies. Their inclusion enhances the whimsical, enchanted atmosphere of the scene. Thus, small butterflies are indeed visible and appear to be hovering near the teapot’s decorations.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image use primarily subtle earth-toned colors (e.g., browns, greens, soft grays) throughout the scene, avoiding bright or metallic highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a palette dominated by muted, natural tones. The wooden base and table surface exhibit warm browns; the velvet lining is a soft dusty rose or tan; the plants include greens and pale pinks; and the teapot itself, though metallic, has a subdued silver-gray finish with no harsh reflections. The lighting is soft and diffused, contributing to an overall calm, earthy aesthetic. While the teapot does reflect some light due to its polished surface, these highlights are gentle and do not overpower the scene. Bright colors such as reds, yellows, or vivid blues are absent. The background, with its neutral curtains and window light, reinforces this understated color scheme. Therefore, the image relies heavily on subtle earth tones without prominent bright or flashy metallic accents.",

      "question": "Are the original ornate floral engravings and decorative details of the teapot still clearly visible and preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teapot in Image B retains all the intricate floral engravings and decorative elements seen in the original design. The roses, leaves, and swirling patterns on the body, lid, and handle are sharply defined and highly detailed. Despite being placed under a glass dome and surrounded by new elements like plants and butterflies, the engraved surfaces remain unobscured and well-lit. The lighting emphasizes the depth and texture of the carvings, ensuring they are not lost in shadow or obscured by other objects. There is no indication of damage, wear, or alteration to the engravings themselves. Thus, the original decorative details are fully preserved and clearly visible.",

      "question": "Does the glass dome completely enclose the teapot, base, plants, and butterflies without any visible openings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B forms a seamless, closed curve over the entire display. It extends from the wooden base upward, fully covering the teapot, the velvet lining, the emerging plants, and the butterflies. There are no visible seams, gaps, or openings at the bottom or sides. The dome appears to be sealed at its base, resting snugly on the wooden stand, which prevents any air circulation or escape of the contained elements. The clarity and continuity of the glass suggest a complete enclosure, designed to preserve the scene as a self-contained diorama. Even the butterflies appear trapped inside, reinforcing the idea of a fully sealed environment. Therefore, the dome completely encloses everything within it.",
