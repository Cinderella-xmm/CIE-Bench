      "question": "Are bold ink outlines visible around all major elements of the car and scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style is clearly inspired by comic book art. The car, wheels, track, and even the speech bubble are defined by thick, black ink outlines that emphasize their shapes and separate them from the background. This is a hallmark of traditional comic illustration, where bold lines are used to create clarity and contrast. Every major component—such as the body panels, tires, suspension, and the dirt track—is outlined with consistent, prominent strokes. These outlines serve both aesthetic and functional purposes in comics, enhancing readability and reinforcing the stylized nature of the image. Based on this observation, it's evident that bold ink outlines are present around all major elements.",

      "question": "Is halftone dot shading applied to at least one surface of the car or background to create texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Halftone dot patterns are a classic technique in print comics used to simulate gradients and textures. In Image B, such patterns are visible in multiple areas: the background has a subtle stippled texture, particularly noticeable in the sky and parts of the ground, which gives a vintage comic-book feel. Additionally, the shadows under the car and along the edges of the track feature fine dot patterns, suggesting depth and shading without solid gradients. This technique is consistent with traditional comic art styles and is used here to enhance the tactile quality of the image. Therefore, halftone dot shading is indeed applied to at least one surface.",

      "question": "Are all visible colors limited to cream, muted orange, and deep gray without any additional hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B is dominated by cream (used for the background), muted orange (seen in the car’s accents and the 'VROOM!' text), and deep gray (in the car’s body and shadowed areas). However, upon closer inspection, there are other hues present: the black ink outlines, the brownish tones in the dirt track, and some subtle variations in the tire treads suggest the inclusion of darker browns and blacks. While the overall scheme is restricted and stylized, the presence of these additional tones—especially the brown dirt and black outlines—means the palette extends beyond just cream, muted orange, and deep gray. Thus, the color range includes more than the three specified hues.",

      "question": "Are motion lines present around the car to indicate skidding or rapid movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Motion lines are a standard comic book device to convey speed and direction. In Image B, dynamic diagonal lines extend from the rear of the car and trail behind the wheels, indicating forward momentum and possible skidding. These lines are drawn in black and vary in thickness and spacing to suggest velocity and turbulence. They are especially concentrated near the back wheels and the dust cloud, reinforcing the impression of rapid movement. This use of motion lines is consistent with how action is depicted in comic illustrations, making their presence clear and intentional.",

      "question": "Is there a speech bubble above the car containing an action word like “VROOM!” in comic-style lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A prominent speech bubble is located in the upper-left portion of Image B. It features jagged edges typical of comic sound effects and contains the word 'VROOM!' in large, stylized, uppercase letters with a bold outline and a slight gradient fill. The font and layout are characteristic of comic book sound effects, designed to emphasize action and energy. The placement and design align perfectly with common conventions in graphic novels and illustrated action scenes, confirming its purpose as a dynamic sound effect.",

      "question": "Has the background been simplified to remove detailed elements such as spectators and fencing, focusing only on motion and basic environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is significantly simplified compared to a realistic depiction. There are no spectators, fences, or detailed stadium structures visible. Instead, the backdrop consists of a flat, textured cream area with minimalistic elements like motion lines and dirt tracks. This abstraction removes real-world complexity and focuses attention on the car and its movement. The simplification aligns with comic book aesthetics, where backgrounds are often reduced to essential components to highlight action. This contrasts sharply with the original photo (Image A), which shows a crowded audience and fencing. Thus, the editing process has deliberately stripped away detail to emphasize motion and drama.",
