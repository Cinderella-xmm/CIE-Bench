      "question": "Have the giraffes' necks been exaggeratedly elongated in a whimsical caricature style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffes' necks appear longer and more slender than typical real-world proportions, which is characteristic of cartoon or caricature styles. While giraffes naturally have long necks, the degree of elongation here exceeds realistic anatomy, especially when compared to the proportion of their bodies. This exaggeration is common in animated or whimsical depictions to emphasize humor or charm. The necks are drawn with smooth, flowing lines that suggest stylization rather than realism, supporting the conclusion that they are exaggerated in a caricature style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the giraffes' facial traits, such as eyes, ears, and ossicones, emphasized in a whimsical caricature style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features of the giraffes in Image B show clear signs of stylization. Their eyes are large, round, and expressive with prominent eyelashes and wide pupils, which are typical of cartoon characters designed to convey emotion. The ears are oversized and rounded, adding to the playful appearance. The ossicones (horn-like structures) are also exaggerated—larger and more defined than in real giraffes—and placed symmetrically for visual appeal. These features collectively indicate a deliberate emphasis on cuteness and expressiveness, aligning with whimsical caricature design principles.",

      "question": "Has the original background, including trees, rocks, grass, and sky, been preserved without any alterations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears visually similar to that in Image A, featuring green trees, scattered rocks, grassy terrain, and a blue sky. However, upon closer inspection, the lighting and color saturation in Image B are slightly more vibrant and uniform, suggesting digital enhancement. Additionally, the shadows cast by the giraffes are softer and more idealized, indicating possible post-processing adjustments. While the core elements remain consistent, subtle changes in tone and clarity suggest the background has undergone stylistic modifications to match the cartoon aesthetic of the giraffes. Therefore, it cannot be said that the background was preserved without alterations.",

      "question": "Do the overall proportions of the giraffes reflect a whimsical caricature style with exaggerated features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall proportions of the giraffes in Image B deviate from natural anatomy. Their legs are unusually thin and elongated, and their bodies are more compact relative to their necks and heads. The heads are larger and more rounded, with oversized facial features, contributing to a comical and anthropomorphic look. These distortions are hallmarks of caricature art, where features are amplified for expressive effect. Real giraffes have a more balanced body structure, so the proportions in Image B clearly reflect an intentional exaggeration for whimsical appeal.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "There are no visible new objects or elements introduced into the background of Image B that were not present in Image A. The trees, rocks, grass, and sky maintain consistent placement and composition. However, while no new elements are added, the background has been artistically enhanced—such as increased brightness, smoother textures, and more saturated colors—to complement the cartoon style of the giraffes. Since these are aesthetic adjustments rather than additions of new content, no actual new elements were inserted into the scene.",
