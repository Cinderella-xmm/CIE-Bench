      "question": "Are all architectural elements of the building rendered with sharp, angular edges characteristic of a paper-cut art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural elements such as the gabled roof, window frames, and door outlines are depicted with clean, precise lines that mimic the appearance of cut paper. The edges are uniformly sharp and lack any softness or curvature, which is typical of paper-cut art where each shape is defined by clean cuts. This style avoids gradients or rounded forms, emphasizing geometric clarity. The visual cues—such as the crisp black outlines, flat color fills, and layered appearance—align with traditional paper-cut techniques. Therefore, based on these visual characteristics and knowledge of paper-cut art styles, it can be concluded that the architectural elements are indeed rendered in this manner.",

      "question": "Are the window frames and plant motifs enhanced with visible gold foil-like accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the window frames and surrounding plant motifs exhibit a shimmering, reflective quality consistent with gold foil application. These elements have a metallic sheen and appear slightly raised compared to the rest of the surface, suggesting a layering technique often used in decorative paper art. Gold foil is commonly used in such artworks to highlight details and add elegance. The golden leaves and flower pots near the windows and doors further support this observation. Thus, combining visual evidence with common practices in decorative paper art, it is evident that gold foil-like accents are present.",

      "question": "Is the entrance awning colored in a bold crimson hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The awning above the entrance in Image B is distinctly red, with a rich, saturated tone that stands out against the neutral background. Its color is consistent across all four panels where it appears (top-left and bottom-right), and it matches the description of 'bold crimson.' In paper art, such vivid colors are often used to draw attention to key features like entrances. The red is uniform and lacks any gradient or variation, reinforcing its deliberate artistic choice. Given the visual evidence and standard use of color in such designs, the awning is indeed colored in a bold crimson hue.",

      "question": "Is the background of each postcard rendered with a textured cream-colored paper appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each of the four panels in Image B has a background that mimics the look of textured cream-colored paper. The surface shows subtle variations in tone and fine grain patterns, resembling handmade or watercolor paper. This texture is consistent across all panels and serves as a base for the layered paper-cut elements. Such a background is typical in high-quality artistic postcards or stationery to enhance the tactile and visual appeal. Based on visual cues and knowledge of paper art design conventions, the background does feature a textured cream-colored paper appearance.",

      "question": "Does each postcard feature a geometric arch border around its edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each of the four panels in Image B is framed by an ornate, geometric arch border composed of thin, golden lines forming angular patterns. This border encloses the central image and follows a consistent design across all panels, indicating intentional symmetry and artistic framing. The arches are not simple curves but incorporate triangular and linear elements, giving them a structured, decorative quality. This aligns with common design practices in artistic postcards where borders are used to define and enhance the composition. Therefore, yes, each postcard includes such a geometric arch border.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the postcards presented without any visible frame or border, maintaining a clean, borderless edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although each individual postcard within Image B has a decorative internal border (the geometric arch), the entire composition is displayed with a light gray outer margin separating the four panels. This suggests that the postcards are arranged on a larger surface, possibly a display board or digital layout, and are not truly borderless. Furthermore, the presence of distinct spacing between the panels indicates they are separate entities with defined edges. A truly borderless presentation would lack any visible separation or framing. Since there is a clear margin and spacing, the postcards are not presented without any visible frame or border.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains four distinct panels arranged in a 2x2 grid. Each panel presents a different view or detail of the same architectural theme: one shows the full house, two focus on windows, and one highlights the entrance. Since there are four panels, not three, the statement is incorrect. Even though they depict variations of the same building, the count is clearly four. Therefore, based on direct visual counting and understanding of the layout, the number of postcards is not three.",
