      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) is clearly structured as a comic strip with two separate rectangular sections stacked vertically. The top panel shows a plaid tie with arms and hands holding a device, while the bottom panel features a man with headphones holding a camera, interacting with the same tie now displaying an emblem. This layout is characteristic of a multi-panel comic format, where each panel represents a different moment or perspective in a sequence. The division between panels is marked by clear borders, confirming that the image is indeed split into at least two distinct panels.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two men in the image transformed into cartoon-style anthropomorphic agents with visible agent-like characteristics (e.g., expressive faces, limbs, spy traits)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two individuals from the original photo are not both depicted as full anthropomorphic agents. The man on the left (with glasses) appears in a realistic form but is shown holding a camera, suggesting a role akin to a spy or technician. However, the most notable transformation is of the plaid tie, which has been given human-like arms and hands, holding a device resembling a communicator. This anthropomorphized tie exhibits spy-like traits such as using a secret device and engaging in covert communication. While the man on the right (from the original photo) is absent in this version, the tie itself functions as a cartoon-style anthropomorphic agent. Thus, only one character (the tie) is fully transformed into an agent-like figure with limbs and spy attributes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the plaid-patterned tie have a visible watch communicator device, and is there a visual expression of urgency (such as motion lines or an alarmed facial expression)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the top panel of Image B, the plaid tie is shown with arms and hands. One hand is holding a small device resembling a watch communicator, which aligns with the spy theme. However, there is no visible facial expression on the tie—no eyes, mouth, or other features indicating emotion. Additionally, there are no motion lines, glowing effects, or other visual cues that suggest urgency or alarm. The tone appears calm and conversational, based on the speech bubbles and lack of dynamic elements. Therefore, while the watch-like device is present, there is no indication of urgency.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a circular camera lens symbol embedded within the pattern of the tie with the emblem, and is there a visual indication of activation (e.g., glow, red dot)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the bottom panel of Image B, the plaid tie displays a crest or emblem featuring a crown and shield design, typical of a heraldic badge. Within this emblem, there is no visible circular camera lens symbol. Instead, the design is ornamental and symbolic, likely representing authority or affiliation. Furthermore, there is no glow, red dot, or any other visual cue suggesting activation or functionality of a hidden camera. The emblem appears static and decorative, not technological. Thus, neither the lens nor activation indicators are present.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there thought bubbles present above or near the heads of the anthropomorphized agents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top panel features a thought bubble emanating from the anthropomorphized tie, containing text that suggests internal dialogue or thoughts. This is consistent with comic book conventions where thought bubbles indicate a character's inner monologue. In the bottom panel, speech bubbles appear above the man with glasses and the tie, indicating dialogue rather than thoughts. However, since the tie is the only anthropomorphized agent and it does have a thought bubble in the first panel, the answer is affirmative. Thought bubbles are indeed present near the anthropomorphized agent.",

      "question": "Is the background of the image a stylized depiction of a lush green field, consistent with the original setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B depicts a vibrant, green field with tall grass and some plants, similar to the outdoor setting in Image A. However, the style is clearly stylized—using exaggerated colors, simplified textures, and uniform lighting typical of comic art. This artistic rendering enhances the visual appeal and supports the cartoonish tone of the characters. Despite the stylization, the core elements (green field, open sky, distant trees) match the original environment, confirming that the background is a stylized but recognizable version of the original setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in the speech and thought bubbles of Image B appears to be written in a stylized, distorted font that mimics gibberish or code-like language. The letters are uneven, irregular, and not aligned in a clean, modern typeface. It lacks the clarity and simplicity of a crisp, minimalist sans-serif font. Instead, it resembles a playful or satirical cipher, possibly intended to evoke secrecy or parody. This font choice is inconsistent with minimalist design principles and serves a thematic purpose rather than readability. Therefore, the text does not use a crisp, minimalist, sans-serif font.",
