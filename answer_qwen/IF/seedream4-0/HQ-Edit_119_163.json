      "question": "Has the body of the teapot been transformed into a sleek cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the object is clearly cylindrical in shape, differing significantly from traditional teapot forms. This sleek, straight-sided design contrasts with the more rounded, bulbous form typically seen in classic teapots. The visual evidence shows a uniform diameter along the height of the body, which is characteristic of a cylinder. This transformation suggests a modern or industrial redesign, possibly for functional or aesthetic reasons such as easier stacking or manufacturing. Based on this observation and common knowledge of teapot designs, the body has indeed been changed to a cylindrical shape.",

      "question": "Are the dragon engravings still present and visibly detailed on the body of the canister?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the object features a prominent, intricately engraved dragon that wraps around the surface. The details include scales, claws, and flowing lines typical of traditional East Asian dragon motifs. These engravings are highly visible and well-defined, suggesting they were intentionally preserved or redesigned as a key decorative element. Given the cultural significance of dragons in tea-related artifacts (especially in Chinese and Japanese traditions), it's plausible that the engraving was retained for symbolic or aesthetic value. The craftsmanship indicates a high level of detail, confirming the presence and visibility of the dragon motif.",

      "question": "Has the original hinged lid been replaced with a metallic screw cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the object features a circular, flat cap with a threaded stem extending downward into the body. This structure is consistent with a screw cap mechanism, designed to be twisted on and off rather than hinged. Unlike the original image (Image A), which shows a domed, hinged lid with a knob, this version lacks any visible hinge or lever mechanism. Instead, the cap appears to be secured by threading, indicating a functional change from a traditional lid to a screw-on type. This modification likely enhances sealing and durability, aligning with modern container design principles.",

      "question": "Are intricate tea leaf patterns embossed around the circumference of the screw cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the screw cap in Image B, there is no visible embossing of tea leaf patterns around its edge. Instead, the cap features a minimalist design with a central logo of two leaves flanked by laurel-like elements. The outer rim of the cap appears smooth and unadorned, lacking any repeating or decorative leaf motifs. While tea leaf imagery is common in tea branding, the specific detail of 'intricate tea leaf patterns' embossed around the circumference is absent. Therefore, based on visual evidence and typical design practices, the answer is no.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Dragon's Delight\" visibly inscribed along the length of the spout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spout of the object has a curved, elongated shape, and along its outer surface, the words 'Dragon's Delight' are clearly etched in a cursive, elegant font. The text follows the contour of the spout, making it both readable and stylistically integrated. This inscription serves as branding or product identification, common in premium or themed tea products. The presence of the text is confirmed through direct visual observation and matches the known naming convention used in the imageâ€™s branding elements (also seen on the lid).",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top surface of the screw cap displays a simple, symmetrical logo consisting of two stylized leaves arranged vertically, with a small stem connecting them. This design is minimalist and centered, surrounded by a subtle wreath-like pattern. The use of leaf imagery aligns with tea-related themes, reinforcing the product's identity. The logo is clearly visible and positioned at the apex of the cap, serving as a brand emblem. This matches common branding strategies where simplicity and symbolism are combined for recognition. Therefore, the presence of a minimalist tea leaf logo is confirmed.",
