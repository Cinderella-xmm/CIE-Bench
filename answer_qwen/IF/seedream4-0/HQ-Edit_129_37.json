      "question": "Has the compass been transformed into a bottle-shaped object with a distinct body, neck, and cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object appears to be a reimagined version of a compass. Instead of a traditional circular metal compass, it now has a transparent, rounded body resembling a glass bottle. The top portion includes a cylindrical structure that functions as a neck, culminating in a cap-like component. This design mimics the form of a perfume or fragrance bottle, suggesting a transformation from a functional navigational tool into a decorative or commercial product. The presence of a spray nozzle further supports this interpretation. Based on visual cues such as the clear separation between the base (body), the narrow upper section (neck), and the top closure (cap), it is evident that the compass has been stylized into a bottle-shaped object. This conclusion aligns with common design practices where historical instruments are repurposed into modern aesthetic objects.",

      "question": "Is the body of the object a circular glass-like container with the compass face visible as an embossed or raised pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the object in Image B is indeed circular and transparent, resembling glass. Inside this container, the compass face is clearly visible, featuring intricate radial lines and directional markings typical of a compass rose. The pattern appears to be embedded within the glass, giving the impression of being embossed or raised, though it may be a printed or etched design beneath the surface. The clarity and depth of the design suggest it is not merely flat but has a three-dimensional quality, consistent with an embossed appearance. This is a common technique used in artistic or luxury items to preserve the aesthetic of vintage instruments while integrating them into modern designs.",

      "question": "Has the compass needle been replaced with a metal spray nozzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central part of the compass, which would traditionally house the magnetic needle, now features a metallic spray nozzle extending upward from the center. This nozzle is connected to the cap and appears to be functional, indicating that the object is likely a perfume bottle. The spray mechanism replaces the original needle, which is no longer present. This substitution suggests a deliberate redesign where the functional element of the compass has been replaced with a practical feature for dispensing liquid. Such transformations are common in product design when historical motifs are adapted for contemporary use.",

      "question": "Does the cap of the object feature an engraving resembling a vintage map?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap of the object in Image B is cylindrical and made of a bronze-toned material. On its surface, there is a detailed engraving that depicts a network of lines, circles, and geographical markings, strongly resembling an old-world map or nautical chart. This design choice aligns with the overall theme of exploration and antiquity suggested by the surrounding elements like the torn map fragments and wooden chest. The engraving is not abstract but contains recognizable cartographic features such as latitude and longitude lines, compass roses, and labeled regions, confirming that it is intended to resemble a vintage map.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the object have a bronze-toned gradient finish that gives it an antique appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B exhibits a rich, warm metallic finish that transitions from darker to lighter shades of bronze, particularly around the rim and cap. This gradient effect enhances the perception of depth and age, contributing to an antique aesthetic. The coloration is consistent with aged brass or copper, materials often used in vintage instruments and decorative items. The lighting highlights these tonal variations, reinforcing the impression of a weathered, historical artifact. This finish is intentional, designed to evoke a sense of nostalgia and craftsmanship, which is common in products inspired by exploration themes.",

      "question": "Is there minimalist branding (such as small text or logo) imprinted around the rim of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the rim of the object in Image B, there are no visible signs of text, logos, or any form of branding. While the outer edge of the glass body has some engraved markings, these appear to be part of the compass design (e.g., cardinal directions or numerical gradations) rather than commercial branding. The absence of any distinct letters, symbols, or trademarks indicates that the object lacks minimalist branding. In contrast, many modern perfume bottles include subtle branding elements, but in this case, the design focuses entirely on the thematic representation of a compass and map, without incorporating corporate identifiers.",
