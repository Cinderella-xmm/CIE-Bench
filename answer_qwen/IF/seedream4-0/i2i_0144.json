      "question": "Has a small flag reading “Fresh” been added on top of the sandwich?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small white flag with the word 'Fresh' written in green is clearly visible, inserted into the top of the sandwich. The flag is positioned vertically and appears to be attached to a toothpick or similar thin stick, which is common in food presentation to highlight freshness or branding. This visual cue is absent in Image A, confirming that it was added in the edited version. Based on common culinary presentation practices, such flags are often used in restaurants or promotional images to emphasize freshness, making this addition both plausible and visually coherent.",

      "question": "Have the tomato slices been replaced with grilled pineapple slices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layer that was previously a red tomato slice in Image A has been replaced with a yellow, circular fruit slice showing grill marks and a slightly charred surface. This appearance is consistent with grilled pineapple, which is commonly used in sandwiches for its sweet and tangy flavor profile. The color, texture, and grill marks are distinct from those of a tomato, which would be red and smooth. Therefore, based on visual characteristics and culinary knowledge, the tomato has indeed been replaced with grilled pineapple.",

      "question": "Are the layers of lettuce and meat unchanged except for the addition of the flag and substitution of the tomato?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layers of lettuce and deli meat (likely turkey) in Image B appear visually identical to those in Image A. Both images show multiple layers of pale pink meat and bright green, ruffled lettuce leaves. There is no indication of changes in quantity, arrangement, or condition of these ingredients. The only modifications observed are the replacement of the tomato with grilled pineapple and the addition of the 'Fresh' flag. This suggests that the core components of the sandwich—lettuce and meat—remain unchanged, aligning with typical editing practices where only specific elements are altered for visual effect or thematic emphasis.",

      "question": "Do the pineapple slices appear grilled, showing char marks or a browned exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pineapple slice in Image B displays distinct dark lines and browned areas across its surface, consistent with grill marks. These markings are indicative of direct heat exposure, such as grilling or pan-searing, which causes caramelization and charring. In contrast, raw pineapple would have a uniform yellow color without such patterns. The presence of these marks confirms that the pineapple has been grilled, enhancing its flavor and texture, which is a common preparation method in gourmet sandwiches.",

      "question": "Does the flag sit properly on top of the sandwich without disrupting its composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flag in Image B is positioned centrally on the top bun, secured by a toothpick or skewer that does not visibly distort the structure of the sandwich. The placement is balanced and does not cause any noticeable displacement of ingredients like the bun, meat, or pineapple. It maintains the sandwich’s symmetry and aesthetic appeal, which is important in food photography. The flag’s size and placement are proportionate, ensuring it enhances rather than disrupts the overall composition. This careful integration reflects good design practice in food presentation.",
