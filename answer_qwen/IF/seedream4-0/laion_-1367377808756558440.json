      "question": "Is the entire naval scene enclosed within a visible vintage glass lantern structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central ship and surrounding dock area appear to be framed by a large, transparent glass lantern with a copper or brass-colored top. This lantern structure is clearly visible, with its glass dome enclosing the entire scene, including the ship, the dock, and the figures. The edges of the glass are evident, especially around the compasses and the upper portion of the image. The reflection and transparency of the glass suggest it is a physical enclosure, not just a visual effect. Given that this is a steampunk-style edit, such a lantern serves both as a thematic element and a visual container for the scene. The presence of steam inside further supports the idea that the scene is contained within a sealed environment. Therefore, based on visual cues and the artistic style, the entire naval scene is indeed enclosed within a visible vintage glass lantern structure.",

      "question": "Does the ship feature brass-colored finishes and visible rotating gears as part of its mechanical design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ship in Image B has been transformed into a steampunk-style vessel. Its hull and superstructure are rendered in a rich brass or copper color, consistent with steampunk aesthetics that emphasize industrial materials like brass and iron. Numerous mechanical components, including large gears, pipes, and pistons, are visibly integrated into the ship’s design. These gears are detailed and appear to be in motion, particularly near the deck and engine areas, suggesting active mechanical function. This contrasts sharply with a standard naval vessel, which would have a more utilitarian metal finish without exposed gears. The presence of these elements aligns with the steampunk genre's emphasis on retro-futuristic machinery. Thus, the ship does feature brass-colored finishes and visible rotating gears as part of its mechanical design.",

      "question": "Are the figures on the dock replaced with metal automatons wearing Victorian-style attire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures from the original dock scene have been replaced with humanoid automatons made of metal, featuring intricate mechanical joints and limbs. These automatons are dressed in Victorian-era clothing, including top hats, waistcoats, and long coats, which are characteristic of steampunk fashion. Their posture and placement mimic the original human figures, but their metallic construction and stylized clothing confirm they are not real people. This transformation is consistent with the steampunk theme, where technology and historical fashion merge. Comparing this to Image A, where ordinary pedestrians walk along the dock, the replacement is clear and intentional. Therefore, the figures on the dock have indeed been replaced with metal automatons wearing Victorian-style attire.",

      "question": "Are there visible floating steam clouds inside the lantern, adding dynamic movement to the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the glass lantern structure in Image B, there are distinct plumes of white steam rising from the ship’s smokestack and drifting upward through the glass enclosure. These steam clouds are not static; they appear to be in motion, curling and dispersing, which adds a sense of dynamic activity to the otherwise still scene. The steam enhances the industrial and mechanical atmosphere typical of steampunk imagery. The visibility of the steam within the confines of the lantern suggests it is an internal feature, contributing to the illusion of a functioning, self-contained mechanical world. This detail is absent in Image A, where no steam is present. Hence, the presence of floating steam clouds inside the lantern is confirmed.",

      "question": "Are there oversized compasses and stylized maritime flags present in the scene to enhance thematic depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features two large, ornate compasses mounted on either side of the glass lantern. These compasses are significantly larger than normal navigational instruments and are designed with a vintage, brass aesthetic, complete with Roman numerals and intricate detailing. They serve both a decorative and symbolic purpose, reinforcing the nautical and exploratory themes of the scene. Additionally, while the flags are not dramatically altered in style, they remain present and contribute to the maritime setting. However, the 'stylized' aspect of the flags is less pronounced compared to the compasses. The primary enhancement to thematic depth comes from the oversized compasses, which are a hallmark of steampunk art—blending functionality with exaggerated design. Thus, the presence of oversized compasses is confirmed, though the flags are not notably stylized beyond their original appearance. Overall, the scene includes oversized compasses, fulfilling the requirement for enhanced thematic depth.",
