      "question": "Is the image presented as a rectangular card with defined borders and structured layout resembling an RPG collectible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is clearly framed within a rectangular border that has decorative metallic corners and edges, giving it the appearance of a collectible card. The layout includes structured elements such as stat bars at the bottom, a nameplate in the center, and a banner at the top—common features in role-playing game (RPG) or trading card designs. These visual cues, combined with the stylized presentation of character stats and title placement, strongly suggest the image is designed to resemble an RPG collectible card.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the name \"Kaitiaki of the Valleys\" displayed on the card, either in a nameplate or title area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nameplate located below the warrior displays the text 'Meadiupirt,' which does not match 'Kaitiaki of the Valleys.' Additionally, the wooden banner at the top contains no visible text. Based on the visible content, the name 'Kaitiaki of the Valleys' is not present anywhere on the card. Therefore, the correct answer is 'No.'",

      "question": "Are the bold moko patterns on the warrior's face and body clearly visible and unchanged from the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moko tattoos on the warrior’s face and body are highly detailed, featuring traditional Māori spiral and geometric designs. These patterns are prominent and consistent with cultural representations of moko kauae and full-body moko. There is no indication of distortion or alteration compared to typical depictions; thus, they appear clearly visible and unchanged from what would be expected in a faithful representation of such artistry. Without access to the original for direct comparison, this assessment is based on the clarity and authenticity of the design as depicted.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The warrior is wearing a layered, grass-like skirt made of natural fibers, consistent with a traditional Māori piupiu, typically crafted from flax. The texture, layering, and flow of the material are accurately rendered, matching known cultural attire. There is no deviation in form or material representation, indicating that the piupiu is both present and correctly depicted.",

      "question": "Is the warrior in a wide, dynamic stance with legs apart and arms outstretched, consistent with a haka pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The warrior stands with legs widely apart and knees bent, arms extended outward with fingers splayed—a classic posture associated with the haka, a traditional Māori war dance. This stance conveys strength and aggression, aligning with the ceremonial nature of the haka. The facial expression, including tongue protrusion, further supports this interpretation. Thus, the pose is consistent with a haka performance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the artwork use a stylized 3D rendering style with rich earthy tones (e.g., deep greens, browns, tans) throughout the character and environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image exhibits a high level of detail and depth characteristic of 3D digital rendering, with realistic lighting, shadows, and textures. The color palette includes deep greens in the valley background, rich browns in the warrior’s skin tone and clothing, and tans in the piupiu and leg wraps. These earthy tones dominate the composition, reinforcing a natural, grounded aesthetic consistent with a stylized 3D art style.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background composed of a layered, lush green valley with visible depth and multiple mountain ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background shows a series of rolling hills and mountain ridges receding into the distance, creating a sense of depth. The vegetation is dense and green, suggesting a tropical or temperate forested valley. Layered fog and atmospheric perspective enhance the three-dimensional feel. This matches the description of a lush, layered valley with multiple ridges.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of the card, there are four distinct stat bars. From left to right: 'Courage +10', 'MANA +9', 'Rhytm +8', and 'Leadersr +7'. While the last two labels contain spelling errors ('Rhytm' instead of 'Rhythm', 'Leadersr' instead of 'Leadership'), the intended values are clear and match the given choices. Therefore, despite minor typographical issues, the stat bars are present and identifiable as described.",

      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Is there a banner at the top of the card with a carved-wood appearance and text indicating the character's title?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is a wooden banner at the top of the card with intricate carvings resembling Māori motifs. However, the banner contains no visible text. While the design suggests it could hold a title, no actual title is written on it. Therefore, although the banner exists and has a carved-wood appearance, it does not display any textual title.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nameplate beneath the warrior reads 'Meadiupirt,' which is not 'Kaitiaki of the Valleys.' Despite being positioned where a name might go, the text does not match the requested name. Hence, the name 'Kaitiaki of the Valleys' is not displayed.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The card is framed by a silver-colored border with reflective highlights and ornate corner embellishments that suggest a polished metallic finish. This type of border is common in collectible cards and gives the impression of durability and premium quality. The sheen and detailing support the conclusion that the border has a metallic appearance.",
