    "Question": "Q1: Has the word 'Sharp' been added at the top left of the image?",
    "explanation": "By visually inspecting Image B, the word 'Sharp' is clearly visible in the top-left corner. It is written in a white, brush-stroke style font with a slight underline, which stands out against the dark background. This placement and style are consistent with typical branding or promotional text overlays used to emphasize product attributes. Based on this observation, it can be concluded that the word 'Sharp' has indeed been added to the image.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Has the word 'Clean' been added at the bottom right of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Clean' is prominently displayed in the bottom-right corner. It matches the same brush-stroke style as 'Sharp', suggesting a cohesive design choice. The positioning is deliberate and balanced with the other text element, reinforcing the message about the product's qualities. Given its clear presence and location, it is evident that 'Clean' has been added to the image.",

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the words 'Sharp' and 'Clean' styled as a rough sketch?",
    "explanation": "The typography of both 'Sharp' and 'Clean' features irregular, textured strokes with visible brush-like edges and uneven thickness, resembling hand-drawn lettering. This artistic style mimics a rough sketch or calligraphic effect rather than clean digital fonts. Such styling is often used to convey authenticity, craftsmanship, or a personal touch—qualities desirable in branding for professional tools like hairdressing scissors. Therefore, based on visual analysis, these words are styled as a rough sketch.",
    "answer": "Yes"
