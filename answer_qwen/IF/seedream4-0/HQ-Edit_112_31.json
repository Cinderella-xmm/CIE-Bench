      "question": "Is the horse's head significantly larger than its body, consistent with chibi-style proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is depicted as a plush toy with exaggerated features typical of chibi or kawaii art styles. The head is proportionally much larger compared to the body, which is a hallmark of chibi design—where characters are stylized with oversized heads and small bodies to emphasize cuteness. This visual cue, combined with world knowledge of chibi aesthetics (commonly seen in anime, plush toys, and collectibles), supports the conclusion that the proportions are intentionally skewed for a cute, cartoonish effect. The large head relative to the compact body clearly aligns with this style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the horse have an unusually large, fluffy, and exaggerated mane that appears soft and plush-like?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mane of the horse in Image B is voluminous, highly textured, and extends outward in a bushy fashion, covering much of the head and shoulders. Its appearance is consistent with plush materials—soft, fibrous, and slightly disheveled, resembling real wool or synthetic fiber used in stuffed animals. This exaggeration of the mane is not naturalistic but rather stylistic, enhancing the character’s charm. Given that plush toys often feature such exaggerated, fluffy manes for aesthetic appeal, this observation aligns with common design practices in toy manufacturing.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the horse’s body made of a fabric-like material with visible brown and white patches, resembling soft textile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface texture of the horse in Image B shows a soft, fuzzy appearance typical of felt or plush fabric. The coloration includes distinct brown and white patches, especially on the torso and legs, which resemble stitched or sewn sections commonly found in handmade or mass-produced stuffed animals. The way light interacts with the surface suggests a textile material rather than fur or skin. This is consistent with the construction of plush toys, where different colored fabrics are joined to form patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the horse’s eyes and mouth stylized as embroidered features, such as stitched lines or dots, forming a friendly expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes of the horse in Image B are large, round, and black, appearing as if they are either sewn-on buttons or embroidered details. The mouth is a simple curved line, resembling a stitched smile, which is characteristic of handcrafted or commercial plush toys. These features lack realistic depth or shading and instead follow a simplified, cartoonish design intended to convey friendliness and approachability. This style matches common embroidery techniques used in soft toys to create expressive faces without complex detailing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the horse’s legs noticeably short and stubby compared to its body size, contributing to a cute, toy-like appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The legs of the horse in Image B are proportionally short and thick, with rounded hooves that appear padded. Compared to the large head and bulky torso, the limbs are disproportionately small, reinforcing a childlike, toy-like aesthetic. This is a deliberate design choice in plush toys to enhance cuteness and stability when seated. In real horses, legs are long and slender relative to body size, but here, the shortness is exaggerated for stylistic reasons, aligning with the overall chibi or kawaii theme.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the dandelions in the foreground made of a felt-like material with uniform, round seed heads and thin stems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dandelions in Image B are crafted from what appears to be felt or similar fibrous material. They have perfectly round, fluffy seed heads and straight, thin stems, all uniformly shaped and spaced. This level of symmetry and material texture is inconsistent with natural dandelions, which vary in shape and size. Instead, these artificial flowers resemble handmade decorations commonly used in dioramas or shadow boxes, where consistency and durability are prioritized over realism. Their placement and texture confirm they are part of a constructed scene.",

      "question": "Is the scene enclosed within a visible box or frame, with a forest scene depicted in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the plush horse placed inside a shallow wooden box with a transparent front, resembling a shadow box display. The background features a painted or printed forest scene with trees and foliage, creating depth behind the toy. This framing is intentional, suggesting the item is a collectible or decorative piece. The use of such frames is common in artisanal plush displays to protect and showcase the item while adding context through a scenic backdrop.",
