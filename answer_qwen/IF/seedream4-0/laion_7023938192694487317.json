      "question": "Is the individual's torso and attire rendered as an oversized figurine with exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual is depicted as a bust figurine mounted on a stand. The proportions of the torso appear stylized and somewhat exaggerated compared to natural human anatomy—particularly in the chest and shoulder width, which are broad and smooth, lacking the nuanced musculature or tapering seen in real humans. This suggests a deliberate artistic exaggeration typical of collectible figurines. The head-to-torso ratio also appears slightly disproportionate, with the head being relatively larger than would be expected in a realistic representation. These visual cues, combined with the context of a sculpted bust on a display stand, indicate that the figure is not a life-sized or proportionally accurate rendering but rather an idealized, oversized figurine. This aligns with common practices in commemorative or decorative figurines where features are amplified for aesthetic effect.",

      "question": "Does the figurine wear a stylized athletic jersey that differs from the original realistic shirt design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine wears a short-sleeved black top with a glossy finish, whereas in Image A, the individual wears a long-sleeved, matte-finished athletic shirt. The figurine’s shirt has a more simplified and rigid form, lacking the natural folds and softness of fabric. Additionally, the sleeves are truncated at the biceps, which is inconsistent with the full-length sleeves in Image A. The overall silhouette of the shirt is more structured and less anatomically adaptive, suggesting a stylized interpretation. This deviation from the original realistic garment indicates that the jersey is not a faithful reproduction but a stylized version tailored to the figurine format.",

      "question": "Is the \"Craft\" logo visibly emphasized with increased size, brightness, or contrast compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'CRAFT' logo on the figurine's shoulder in Image B appears consistent in size and placement with the original logo in Image A. There is no noticeable increase in size, brightness, or contrast. The font style and color (white) remain identical, and it blends naturally into the design without drawing undue attention. In comparison, the original logo in Image A is subtle and integrated into the fabric texture. Since there is no visual evidence of enhancement in scale or luminance, the logo maintains its original proportionality and visibility level.",

      "question": "Is the shirt material rendered with a matte-finished black polymer appearance, lacking shine or fabric-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shirt in Image B exhibits a highly reflective, glossy surface with visible highlights and specular reflections, particularly on the shoulders and chest. This sheen is inconsistent with a matte finish and instead suggests a polished, possibly plastic or polymer material. In contrast, the original shirt in Image A has a duller, fabric-like texture with soft shadows and natural wrinkles. The figurine's shirt lacks any textile detail such as weave patterns or drape, reinforcing the impression of a synthetic, non-textile material. Therefore, the material is not matte but rather shiny and artificial.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors in the logo rendered in elevated, bold tones (e.g., bright red, white, blue) that contrast sharply with the black shirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The logo on the figurine’s chest in Image B features the same red, white, and blue elements as in Image A. However, due to the glossy nature of the figurine’s surface, these colors appear more vivid and saturated under lighting conditions, enhancing their contrast against the black background. The red and blue stripes are crisp and well-defined, and the white lettering stands out clearly. While the colors themselves are not altered in hue, their visual impact is heightened by the reflective surface, resulting in a sharper, more pronounced appearance than in the original photo, where the fabric may diffuse light and reduce saturation. Thus, the colors are effectively rendered in bold, elevated tones relative to the original.",

      "question": "Is there a detachable base beneath the figurine that resembles a sleek, contemporary stand made of polished metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is mounted on a cylindrical pole that connects to a circular, flat base. The base and pole have a high-gloss, reflective surface consistent with polished metal, such as chrome or stainless steel. Its design is minimalist and modern, with clean lines and symmetry, resembling a contemporary display stand. The base appears to be separate from the figurine itself, suggesting it is detachable. This kind of stand is commonly used for collectible busts or memorabilia, supporting the idea that it is a functional and removable component.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B shows clear, mirror-like reflections of the surrounding environment, including the ambient light and faint outlines of nearby objects. These reflections are sharp and continuous, indicating a highly polished, smooth surface typical of metals like chrome or brushed steel. The presence of such reflections confirms that the material is reflective and not matte or textured. This behavior is consistent with polished metal surfaces, which produce distinct specular reflections, especially under controlled studio lighting.",
