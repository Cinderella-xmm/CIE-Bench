    "Question": "Q1: Is the character shown in a half-body form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character (Pikachu) is fully visible from head to feet. The entire body is present, including both arms, legs, and tail. There is no truncation or cropping that would suggest a half-body form. Based on visual cues, Pikachu is depicted in full, standing upright with all limbs extended. This is consistent with typical full-body illustrations of animated characters in promotional or interactive media. Therefore, it is not a half-body depiction.",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the character appear to be jumping out of a children’s tablet screen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu is positioned above a tablet device, with its feet hovering just above the screen. Visual effects such as glowing light rays emanating from the screen and a smaller version of Pikachu displayed on the screen suggest that the character is emerging from the digital interface. This effect is commonly used in marketing materials for interactive apps or games to simulate augmented reality or immersive experiences. The tablet itself has a design resembling a child-friendly device—colorful buttons and a bright display—further supporting the idea that it is targeted at children. Thus, the visual composition strongly implies that Pikachu is 'jumping out' of the screen.",
