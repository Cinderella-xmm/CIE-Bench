      "question": "Is the horse visibly composed of distinct 3D puzzle pieces with defined edges separating each section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's body shows clear, angular lines that resemble the interlocking edges of a 3D puzzle. These lines are not natural wood grain or paint demarcations but instead appear as deliberate separations between sections, suggesting modular construction. The segments are visibly distinct, particularly on the torso and neck, where the floral patterns are interrupted by these seams. This is consistent with how puzzle pieces would be designed—each piece forming part of a larger whole, with visible edges. Given the visual evidence of these sharp, geometric breaks across the horse’s surface, it is reasonable to conclude that the horse is indeed composed of distinct 3D puzzle pieces.",

      "question": "Is the horse enclosed within a wooden-framed display case that has a transparent glass dome covering it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse in Image B is positioned inside a structure with a wooden frame, which matches the style of a traditional display case. Above the horse, there is a curved, transparent dome that appears to be made of glass or acrylic, protecting the figure. This dome is seamlessly integrated into the wooden frame, allowing full visibility while enclosing the horse. The presence of this dome, combined with the frame, confirms that the horse is housed in a display case with a transparent glass dome. This setup is typical for preserving decorative or valuable items, especially those with intricate details like this painted horse.",

      "question": "Does the display case rest on a textured wooden base that shows natural wood grain or carving details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base beneath the display case in Image B is clearly made of wood and exhibits pronounced textures resembling natural wood grain. Additionally, the surface includes carved details such as grooves and ridges, giving it a rustic, handcrafted appearance. The base also features functional elements like metal rings and a compass, which are affixed to a thick, cross-sectional piece of wood that mimics a tree stump. These characteristics—natural grain, carving, and organic shape—are consistent with a textured, hand-carved wooden base.",

      "question": "Are the intricate floral patterns on the horse fragmented across individual puzzle sections, with no single piece showing a complete motif?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral designs on the horse in Image B are split across multiple puzzle-like sections. For instance, a rose motif is broken at its stem and petals by the edges of adjacent pieces. Similarly, leaf patterns and smaller floral elements are interrupted by the seams between puzzle segments. No single puzzle piece contains a fully intact flower or complete design element; instead, each contributes only a portion of the overall pattern. This fragmentation is intentional and aligns with the logic of a 3D puzzle, where individual pieces must be assembled to form a cohesive image. Thus, the floral motifs are indeed fragmented across sections.",

      "question": "Is there a vintage-style compass embedded or placed on the wooden base of the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the front of the wooden base in Image B, there is a circular object with a metallic rim and directional markings (N, S, E, W), which is characteristic of a compass. The design is ornate and aged, with a brass-like finish and a star-shaped needle, consistent with a vintage or antique-style compass. It is centrally mounted on the base and appears to be embedded or affixed securely, serving both a decorative and symbolic purpose. This matches the description of a vintage-style compass being present on the base.",

      "question": "Are there visible antique-brass colored accents such as hinges, trim, or fixtures on the display case or base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B features two small, ring-shaped fixtures on either side of the compass, which are metallic and have a golden-yellow hue consistent with antique brass. These rings resemble handles or decorative hardware often found on vintage furniture. Additionally, the compass itself has a brass-colored casing, reinforcing the use of this material. While the main display case does not show obvious hinges or trim, the base clearly incorporates antique-brass colored fixtures. Given that the question asks about 'visible' accents and these are clearly present, the answer is affirmative.",
