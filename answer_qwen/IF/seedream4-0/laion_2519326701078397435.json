      "question": "Has the overall style of the bust been transformed into a steampunk-inspired design, incorporating mechanical or industrial elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bust in Image B displays numerous visual cues consistent with steampunk aesthetics. Steampunk is a subgenre that combines Victorian-era fashion and technology with steam-powered machinery, often featuring brass, copper, gears, and clockwork elements. In this image, the bust has been modified to include mechanical components such as gears embedded in the hair, rivets on the drapery, tubular structures resembling pipes, and a visible clock face on the base. These elements are not present in classical sculptures and are characteristic of steampunk design. The transformation from a traditional neoclassical style (as seen in Image A) to this industrialized form indicates a deliberate stylistic shift toward steampunk.",

      "question": "Have the curls in the hair been replaced with gear-like or cogwheel-shaped structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the hair in Image B, several curls have been replaced or integrated with small, metallic gear-like structures. These cogs are seamlessly embedded within the hair, particularly noticeable at the top and sides of the head. This modification aligns with the steampunk theme, where organic forms are often fused with mechanical parts. In contrast, Image A shows naturalistic curls without any mechanical additions, confirming that the change in Image B is intentional and transformative. The integration of these gears into the hair suggests a fusion of human anatomy with machinery, a hallmark of steampunk art.",

      "question": "Has the drapery been replaced with metallic fabric that includes visible rivets and tubular elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drapery in Image B appears to be reimagined as a metallic material, likely representing leather or metal cloth, with visible rivets along its edges and seams. Additionally, there are tubular elements resembling coiled hoses or pipes running across the chest area, which are typical of industrial design. These features contrast sharply with the smooth, flowing fabric depicted in Image A, which lacks any mechanical details. The inclusion of rivets and tubing suggests a functional, engineered garment rather than a classical robe, reinforcing the steampunk aesthetic. Thus, the drapery has indeed been transformed into a more industrial, mechanical version.",

      "question": "Are vintage watch parts and gears visibly incorporated into the base of the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the bust in Image B clearly features several mechanical components, including a small vintage-style clock face with Roman numerals and multiple interlocking gears. These elements are mounted directly onto the pedestal, suggesting they are part of the sculpture's design rather than decorative additions. The presence of such intricate clockwork mechanisms is consistent with steampunk themes, where timekeeping devices are often central motifs. In Image A, the base is plain and unadorned, lacking any such mechanical features. Therefore, the incorporation of watch parts and gears into the base of Image B is both evident and intentional.",

      "question": "Is there a mechanical monocle device visible over the right eye area of the bust?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right eye area of the bust in Image B does not show any mechanical monocle or similar device. Instead, the eye appears to be intact and sculpted in a classical manner, without any overlaying mechanical component. While there is a circular element near the left side of the chest (possibly a gauge or lens), it is not positioned over the eye. In contrast, Image A also lacks any such device. Given that steampunk designs often include ocular enhancements like mechanical eyes or monocles, their absence here is notable. Therefore, based on visual evidence, no mechanical monocle is present over the right eye.",

      "question": "Has the color scheme of the bust been changed to predominantly feature polished bronze and copper tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color scheme of the bust in Image B is distinctly different from that in Image A. While Image A is rendered in a uniform off-white or marble-like tone, Image B exhibits rich, warm metallic hues—specifically shades of bronze and copper—with reflective surfaces and subtle patina effects. These colors are typical of aged brass and copper, commonly used in steampunk designs to evoke an industrial, Victorian-era feel. The entire sculpture, including the base and mechanical elements, shares this tonal palette, indicating a comprehensive recoloring to match the steampunk theme. Thus, the color transformation is both evident and purposeful.",
