      "question": "Are the keys depicted in a 3D cartoon-style chibi rendition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keys in Image B are rendered with smooth, rounded edges and a glossy finish, which gives them a stylized appearance. However, they do not exhibit exaggerated proportions or simplified features typical of a 'chibi' style—such as large heads, small bodies, or comically oversized limbs—which are common in anime-inspired cartoon renditions. Instead, the keys maintain realistic proportions and intricate detailing, suggesting a more ornamental 3D design rather than a cartoonish or chibi aesthetic. The rendering appears to be a polished, high-quality 3D model with attention to lighting and surface texture, but not one that simplifies or exaggerates features for comedic or cute effect. Therefore, while the image is stylized, it does not match the definition of a chibi rendition.",

      "question": "Have red and gold hues been used in the patterns and details of the keys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keys are predominantly red with gold accents. The main body of each key is red, while decorative elements such as borders, symbols (e.g., the star, eye, cross), and structural outlines are highlighted in gold. For instance, the pentagram, Eye of Horus, Celtic knot, and cross motifs are all rendered in gold against a red background. Additionally, the shafts and connecting parts of the keys feature gold trim or bands. This color scheme is consistent across all six keys, indicating deliberate use of red and gold to create a luxurious, festive appearance. This choice of colors is often associated with celebration, prosperity, and cultural symbolism, particularly in Chinese contexts where red symbolizes good fortune and gold represents wealth.",

      "question": "Does the texture of the keys resemble polished, ornamental accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keys in Image B have a highly reflective, smooth surface with visible highlights and shadows, suggesting a polished finish. The material appears to be non-porous and shiny, resembling plastic or lacquered metal, which is typical of decorative or collectible items. The fine detailing—such as the engraved lines on the cross and the interwoven Celtic knot—further enhances their ornamental quality. These visual cues indicate that the keys are not meant to be functional tools but rather decorative objects. Their design and finish align with those of souvenirs, jewelry, or ceremonial artifacts, reinforcing the impression of polished, ornamental accessories.",

      "question": "Is the backdrop featuring a subtle \"囍\" paper-cut design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B has a light peach or beige tone with faint geometric patterns and red cut-out shapes at the corners. Upon close inspection, these red cut-outs resemble traditional Chinese paper-cut art, commonly used during celebrations like weddings. The character '囍' (double happiness) is a well-known symbol in Chinese culture, often displayed during nuptial events. While the central part of the background is plain, the corner elements clearly show symmetrical, floral-like patterns that are characteristic of '囍' paper cuts. Although the full character may not be fully visible due to cropping, the style, symmetry, and context strongly suggest that these are indeed '囍' paper-cut designs, albeit subtly integrated into the composition.",

      "question": "Have the distinctive shapes and designs of the original keys been preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the fundamental shapes and symbolic designs of the keys remain consistent. Each key in Image B retains its unique head shape: circular with a pentagram, triangular with an abstract motif, circular with an Eye of Horus, ornate scrollwork, circular with a cross, and square with a Celtic knot. These forms are directly mirrored in Image B, even though the materials and colors have changed. The arrangement and relative positions of the keys also remain identical. While the color palette and surface texture differ significantly (from metallic to red-and-gold plastic), the core design elements—such as the number of teeth, overall silhouette, and emblematic symbols—are faithfully preserved. This indicates that the transformation was stylistic rather than structural, maintaining the identity of each key.",
