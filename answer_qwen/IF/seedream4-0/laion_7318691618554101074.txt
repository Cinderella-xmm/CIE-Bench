    "Question": "Q1: Are all makeup brushes replaced with sculpted crystal wands?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the objects previously identified as makeup brushes in Image A are now replaced by three distinct crystal wands. These wands have a faceted, crystalline structure and terminate in gem-like tips, which are clearly not makeup brushes. The shape, material, and design of these objects differ significantly from typical makeup brushes—especially in terms of their transparent, geometric form and decorative nature. Given that no brush bristles or traditional handles are visible, and instead we see intricately cut crystal rods with gemstone tips, it is evident that the original makeup brushes have been entirely replaced. This transformation aligns with common DIY or aesthetic upgrades where functional tools are swapped for decorative items.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does each crystal wand have a unique gemstone at its tip?",
    "explanation": "Observing the three crystal wands in Image B, each one is topped with a different colored gemstone. From left to right: the first has a deep red/purple teardrop-shaped stone, the second has a clear or light blue multifaceted stone, and the third has a vibrant blue gemstone. These stones vary in color and possibly cut, indicating uniqueness. In decorative designs like this, using varied gemstones adds visual interest and suggests intentional differentiation. Since no two gemstones appear identical in hue or clarity, it can be concluded that each wand has a unique gemstone at its tip.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the container a transparent crystal vase with visible etched floral patterns?",
    "explanation": "The container in Image B is indeed made of transparent crystal, as evidenced by its clarity and reflective quality. Upon close inspection, there are intricate etched designs visible on the surface—specifically, floral or leaf-like motifs that are characteristic of hand-cut or engraved crystalware. These patterns are consistent with traditional crystal vases used for display purposes. The transparency allows visibility into the pearls inside, and the detailed engravings suggest craftsmanship typical of crystal glassware. This contrasts with the simple glass jar in Image A, which lacks such ornate detailing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Has the lace band been replaced with a carved crystal ribbon?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the container features a decorative lace band around its upper rim, which is white with blue floral patterns. In Image B, this lace is absent and replaced by a translucent, ridged band encircling the vase. This new band appears to be made of crystal or glass and has a carved, textured pattern resembling a twisted or braided ribbon. It matches the overall crystal theme of the new arrangement and is clearly not fabric. Therefore, the lace has been substituted with a carved crystal element designed to mimic a ribbon, enhancing the luxurious aesthetic. This substitution reflects a shift from soft textile decoration to hard, reflective material.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the entire arrangement placed on a mirrored surface that reflects the crystal vase and wands?",
    "explanation": "The base of the arrangement in Image B shows a clear reflection of the crystal vase and the wands beneath it. The reflection is sharp and symmetrical, suggesting that the surface is highly reflective—most likely a mirror or polished glass. This is further supported by the fact that reflections are visible not only of the vase but also of the individual facets of the crystal wands. Such reflections are typical when objects are placed on mirrored surfaces, especially in decorative setups meant to enhance visual appeal. The presence of this reflection confirms that the surface is mirrored, allowing for the doubling of the visual elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
