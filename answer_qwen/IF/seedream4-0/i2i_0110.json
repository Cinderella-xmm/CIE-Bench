      "question": "Is the vase placed on what appears to be a modern kitchen dining table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is positioned on a flat, rectangular surface with clean lines and a reflective finish, consistent with a modern dining table. The table's design includes a minimalist aesthetic with visible legs that appear to be made of metal or dark wood, typical of contemporary furniture. Additionally, the surrounding environment—such as the chairs with simple backrests and the overall layout—supports the interpretation that this is a modern kitchen setting. The presence of a countertop, sink, and cabinetry in the background further reinforces this conclusion. Based on these visual cues and common knowledge about modern interior design, it is reasonable to conclude that the vase is indeed on a modern kitchen dining table.",

      "question": "Does the background feature sunlight streaming through venetian blinds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B shows horizontal lines of light and shadow across the wall and table surface, which are characteristic of sunlight passing through venetian blinds. These patterns are evenly spaced and parallel, matching the typical appearance when light filters through slatted blinds. The brightness of the light suggests daytime, and the angle of the shadows indicates a source from a window, likely positioned behind the vase. This effect is commonly observed in indoor scenes with natural lighting and blinds. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and understanding of how light interacts with window coverings, the background does feature sunlight streaming through venetian blinds.",

      "question": "Are the vase and sunflowers still the primary focus of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase and sunflowers occupy the central portion of the composition and are rendered with high detail and vibrant colors, drawing immediate attention. The lighting emphasizes them, particularly through the interplay of highlights and shadows on the petals and vase. While the background includes elements like a kitchen counter and window, they are secondary and serve to frame the floral arrangement. The artistic style, reminiscent of Van Gogh’s original painting, maintains the prominence of the sunflowers. Even though the setting has changed from a plain backdrop to a domestic scene, the subject remains visually dominant. Thus, the vase and sunflowers remain the primary focus.",

      "question": "Are there elements in the image indicative of a modern kitchen setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes several features typical of a modern kitchen: sleek white cabinetry, a stainless steel sink, a stovetop with visible burners, and a countertop with minimal clutter. The presence of a knife block and other small kitchen items further supports this interpretation. The overall design language—clean lines, neutral colors, and functional layout—is consistent with contemporary kitchen aesthetics. Additionally, the large window with venetian blinds and the integration of natural light align with modern home design principles. These elements collectively indicate a modern kitchen setting.",

      "question": "Do light and shadow effects consistent with sunlight flowing through blinds appear in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the image displays distinct linear patterns of light and shadow across the table surface and the lower part of the wall, which are directly aligned with the horizontal slats of venetian blinds visible in the background. These alternating bands of illumination and darkness are a hallmark of sunlight passing through such window coverings. The softness and direction of the shadows suggest a low-angle light source, such as morning or late afternoon sun. This phenomenon is well-documented in architectural and interior photography. Therefore, the light and shadow effects in the image are consistent with sunlight flowing through blinds.",
