      "question": "Is the title 'The Evolution of Strength through Time' present and clearly visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the top portion of the image contains a large, bold text that reads 'The Evolution of Strength through Time'. The font is white, highly contrasted against the black background, and centrally positioned, making it easily legible. This matches the exact phrasing of the question. There is no ambiguity in the visibility or content of the title. Therefore, based on visual evidence and standard reading comprehension, the title is both present and clearly visible.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there three distinct representations of the character corresponding to Antiquity, Feudal Era, and Modern Era?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays three separate figures aligned horizontally. Each figure is labeled beneath with a time period: 'Antiquity', 'Ferfug Bale' (which appears to be a misspelling or stylized version of 'Feudal Era'), and 'Moden Ean' (likely a stylized version of 'Modern Era'). Despite the textual errors, the visual depictions clearly represent different historical eras: one in ancient warrior attire, one in medieval armor, and one in modern athletic clothing. These differences in costume, weaponry, and posture indicate distinct eras. Thus, even with the labels being slightly distorted, the three representations are visually distinct and align with the intended historical periods.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the Antiquity version of the character include mythological armor characteristic of Ancient Greek warriors or wrestlers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leftmost figure, labeled 'Antiquity', is depicted wearing a breastplate with segmented plates, a short skirt-like garment (chiton), greaves on the legs, and a laurel wreath on the head—features commonly associated with Ancient Greek warriors or athletes. The pose, with clenched fists and an open mouth as if shouting, also evokes classical depictions of Greek heroes or Olympic competitors. These elements align with mythological and historical representations of strength from antiquity, particularly in Greco-Roman art. Therefore, the attire is consistent with Ancient Greek warrior or wrestler iconography.",

      "question": "Does the Feudal Era version of the character wear heavy plate armor and hold a large sword?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central figure, labeled 'Ferfug Bale' (interpreted as 'Feudal Era'), is clad in full plate armor covering the torso, limbs, and head, including a helmet with a visor. He holds a long, broadsword in his right hand, which is typical of medieval knights. The armor's design includes articulated joints and decorative elements, consistent with European feudal-era knightly gear. The posture suggests readiness for combat, reinforcing the feudal warrior identity. Thus, both the armor and weapon match the expectations of a feudal-era warrior.",

      "question": "Does the Modern Era version of the character wear athletic gear and have a barbell across the shoulders in a weightlifting pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rightmost figure, labeled 'Moden Ean' (interpreted as 'Modern Era'), is dressed in a sleeveless tank top, shorts, and athletic shoes—typical attire for a modern weightlifter. He is holding a barbell across his upper back, with hands gripping the bar and elbows pointing forward, which is a classic overhead press or clean-and-jerk stance. This pose and equipment are emblematic of modern strength training and competitive bodybuilding. Therefore, the depiction accurately reflects a modern athlete engaged in weightlifting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the character’s head, including facial features and expression, identical across all three historical depictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the overall character design is consistent across the three figures (muscular build, similar proportions), the facial features and expressions differ significantly. The Antiquity figure has a more idealized, classical face with a laurel crown and an open-mouthed shout. The Feudal Era figure wears a helmet that obscures most of the face, leaving only the eyes and part of the nose visible, with a stern expression. The Modern Era figure has a more realistic, contemporary face with short hair and an intense grimace while lifting. These differences in facial structure, expression, and accessories (like the helmet) mean the heads are not identical. Even if the underlying character is the same conceptually, the visual representation varies across eras.",

      "question": "Are the attire and posture in each era depicted with sufficient detail to distinguish them as representative of their respective time periods?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each of the three figures is rendered with clear, stylistic details appropriate to their era. The Antiquity figure includes a laurel wreath, segmented armor, and a dynamic fighting stance reminiscent of Greek hoplites or gladiators. The Feudal Era figure wears full plate armor with a sword, indicative of medieval knights. The Modern Era figure is in athletic wear and performs a weightlifting motion, reflecting contemporary fitness culture. The level of detail in clothing, weaponry, and body language is sufficient to convey the distinct cultural and technological contexts of each period. Therefore, the depictions are detailed enough to be recognizable and representative.",
