    "Question": "Q1: Have the individuals been converted into chibi-style 3D cartoon characters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the individuals exhibit exaggerated proportions typical of chibi-style characters—large heads relative to their bodies, simplified facial features, and stylized expressions. Their design includes smooth, rounded forms and a lack of realistic anatomical details, which are hallmarks of 3D cartoon or anime-inspired character models. The rendering style is clearly digital and stylized, not photorealistic, indicating that they have been transformed from real people into animated figures.

    "Question": "Q5: Has the snowy forest backdrop been replaced with a celebratory scenery featuring “囍” paper-cut decorations?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been significantly altered from a natural snowy forest to a more stylized and festive environment. Large red '囍' (double happiness) symbols are prominently displayed in the sky and on the snow-covered ground, along with heart-shaped paper-cut designs. These decorations are characteristic of Chinese wedding or New Year celebrations. While some trees remain, they are now adorned with red ornaments and integrated into the festive theme. In contrast, Image A shows a natural, unadorned snowy forest with no decorations. The transformation indicates a deliberate shift to a celebratory setting, replacing the original backdrop with culturally symbolic elements.",
