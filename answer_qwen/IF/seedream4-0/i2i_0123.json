      "question": "Has the timer on the left been replaced with an illustration of a robotic dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left parking meter's display area, which would typically show time or billing information, has been altered. However, the timer itself (the analog gauge at the top) remains intact and unchanged. The robotic dog is not replacing the timer; instead, it appears as a small mechanical figure attached to the lower part of the meter, near the coin slot. This suggests that the timer is still present and functional, while the robotic dog is an added element in a different region of the meter. Therefore, the timer has not been replaced by the robotic dog.",

      "question": "Is the robotic dog clearly shown holding a coin in its paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small robotic dog-like figure is visible on the left parking meter, positioned near the coin slot. The robot has two articulated arms or paws, and one of them is visibly gripping a gold-colored coin. The positioning and clarity of the object suggest that it is indeed holding the coin. Based on visual cues such as the grip and orientation of the paw around the coin, combined with common knowledge about how robotic arms function, this interaction is clearly depicted. There is no ambiguity in the image regarding the robot's action.",

      "question": "Does the parking meter still display billing information such as numbers and labels in a legible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left parking meter retains all its original digital displays, including the serial number '348487', the time remaining '04:495', and other labels like '21L89 2'711'. These elements are clearly visible and readable despite the addition of the robotic dog. The right meter also shows '1995' and other text, which remain legible. Although the robotic dog is attached to the left meter, it does not obscure the primary display areas. Therefore, the billing information is still presented in a legible format.",

      "question": "Has the overall shape and structure of the parking meter remained consistent with the original design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall shape and structure of both parking meters in Image B are consistent with standard parking meter designs. The meters maintain their vertical, oval-shaped body, the placement of the analog timer at the top, the digital display panels, and the coin insertion slot at the bottom. The addition of the robotic dog is a minor modification that does not alter the fundamental form or structural layout of the meter. Comparing with typical parking meters seen in real-world contexts, this design remains recognizable and structurally unchanged. Thus, the core design integrity is preserved.",

      "question": "Is the robotic dog designed with features such as metallic textures or mechanical parts, making it identifiable as a robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robotic dog in Image B exhibits clear mechanical characteristics: it has segmented limbs, visible joints, and a metallic gray finish with black accents. Its head includes what appears to be a sensor or camera lens, and its body is composed of angular, artificial components rather than organic forms. These features—such as exposed gears, hinges, and a non-biological appearance—are consistent with common depictions of robots. Combined with world knowledge about robotic design, these visual cues strongly indicate that the figure is intended to be recognized as a robot, not a real animal.",
