      "question": "Has the wooden surface been replaced with an elegant marble texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface on which the box is placed is clearly visible. It has a white base with gray veining, characteristic of marble. This contrasts sharply with the dark, weathered wooden surface seen in Image A. The texture and pattern are consistent with polished marble, commonly used in high-end presentations to convey luxury. Based on visual cues such as color, pattern, and reflective quality, it is evident that the surface has been changed from wood to marble. This change aligns with a shift toward a more refined and premium aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is there a transparent label overlaid on the teapot with visible text including \"Earl Grey Elegance\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the box features a clear, transparent label affixed over an image of the teapot. Within this label, the text 'Earl Grey Elegance' is clearly legible in a clean, elegant font. The label appears to be part of the packaging design, not physically attached to the teapot itself. This labeling is typical for premium tea products, where branding and product information are displayed prominently. The transparency allows the ornate design of the teapot image to remain visible while overlaying essential product details.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a finely embossed gold monogram logo visible on the lid of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the packaging rather than the actual teapot. The teapot is depicted on the box's front panel, but the lid of the teapot shown in the image does not display any visible gold monogram. Instead, the top of the box features a gold monogram 'B' centered on a marble-like background. This suggests the brand identity is represented on the packaging, not directly on the teapot’s lid. Therefore, no gold monogram is visible on the lid of the teapot itself in this image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a box present in the image with engravings similar in style to those on the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a box with intricate, ornate engravings on its sides, particularly visible on the right side of the box. These designs feature swirling floral and baroque-style patterns that closely resemble the detailed engravings on the teapot depicted on the front of the box. The consistency in design language between the box and the teapot suggests a deliberate effort to maintain visual harmony. This matching style reinforces the idea that the packaging was designed to reflect the elegance of the product inside.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition reflect a luxury tea brand packaging design with cohesive branding elements such as elegant textures, consistent engravings, and premium presentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B strongly conveys a luxury aesthetic. The use of marble textures (both on the surface and the box), the gold monogram 'B', the refined typography ('Earl Grey Elegance'), and the detailed engravings all contribute to a sense of exclusivity and high quality. The packaging design integrates these elements cohesively—matching the ornamental style of the teapot with the box’s artwork and materials. Such attention to detail, combined with the minimalist yet elegant lighting and staging, is typical of premium tea brands aiming to project sophistication. This holistic approach confirms that the image reflects a luxury tea brand packaging design.",
