      "question": "Is the image formatted as a digital collectible card with a clear border and structured layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is clearly structured like a digital collectible card. It features a defined border with decorative elements, a central character portrait, and a layout that includes a title banner at the top, a nameplate below the character, and stat bars at the bottom. This format is typical of trading cards in games such as Magic: The Gathering or digital collectibles, where visual hierarchy and structured information presentation are essential. The presence of these components confirms it is formatted as a digital collectible card.",

      "question": "Does the woman’s attire retain its vibrant colors and intricate beadwork, rendered in a semi-realistic art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman’s attire in the edited image retains the vibrant colors and intricate beadwork seen in traditional African garments. Her clothing features bold patterns, including red, blue, yellow, and green threads, with detailed embroidery and tassels. The rendering style appears semi-realistic—preserving realistic textures and lighting while slightly stylizing certain elements (e.g., smoother skin tones, enhanced contrast) to fit the aesthetic of a collectible card. This aligns with common artistic approaches in digital collectibles where realism is balanced with illustrative clarity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower portion of the card displays four stat bars labeled as follows: Wisdom +9, Cultural Insight +10, Grace +8, and Unity +9. Each stat is accompanied by a corresponding progress bar with color coding (e.g., dark brown for Wisdom, red/blue for Cultural Insight). These labels are clearly legible and correctly positioned beneath the character image. The values and names match exactly with the question's description, confirming their presence and correct labeling.",

      "question": "Is there a woven-texture banner at the top of the card displaying the title \"Guardian of Heritage\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the card, there is a horizontal banner with a woven-texture appearance, resembling natural fiber or burlap. The text 'Guardian of Heritage' is inscribed on it in a rustic font, consistent with tribal or cultural themes. This design choice enhances the thematic authenticity of the card, suggesting a connection to heritage and tradition. The texture and placement match the description provided in the question.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Directly beneath the character’s image, there is a gold-etched nameplate with ornate detailing and rivet-like embellishments at the corners. The same title, 'Guardian of Heritage,' is displayed in this nameplate, reinforcing the card’s identity. This element is stylistically consistent with collectible card designs, where a secondary title or role label is placed below the character for emphasis and clarity.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the card have a border made of geometric tribal motifs surrounding the central image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The border surrounding the central image is composed of geometric patterns, including triangles, diamonds, and zigzags, arranged in a repeating fashion. These motifs resemble traditional African tribal art and are rendered in earthy tones such as brown, orange, and black. This decorative frame serves both an aesthetic and cultural purpose, framing the character within a context of heritage and identity. The design is consistent with the theme and matches the description in the question.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background behind the character is warm-toned, dominated by hues of orange, amber, and golden yellow, creating a sunset-like ambiance. Abstracted tree trunks and silhouettes of people are visible, blurred and stylized to suggest a gathering or communal setting without distracting from the central figure. This artistic treatment emphasizes atmosphere and cultural context while maintaining focus on the character, which aligns with the description of a warm-toned, abstracted environment.",
