    "Question": "Q1: Do the sushi pieces form a clear figure of a person?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sushi pieces are arranged in a way that clearly outlines the shape of a human figure. The arrangement includes distinct sections for the head, torso, arms, and legs, all formed using various types of sushi such as salmon nigiri, maki rolls, and other sushi varieties. The overall silhouette resembles a standing person with limbs extended, which is a deliberate artistic representation. This conclusion is drawn from visual cues such as the positioning of the sushi pieces to mimic anatomical features (e.g., a round head, rectangular torso, and elongated limbs). The use of different colors and shapes helps distinguish body parts, making the figure easily recognizable as a person.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the right arm of the person figure visibly lifted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right arm of the figure (on the viewer's left side) is extended upward and outward, forming an angle that suggests it is lifted. This is evident from the alignment of the sushi pieces along the arm, which extends diagonally upward from the shoulder area. The use of salmon and other sushi types creates a continuous line that mimics the shape of a raised arm. Based on common anatomical representations, a limb positioned above the horizontal plane is considered 'lifted.' Therefore, the visual evidence supports that the right arm is indeed visibly lifted.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the figure include a left arm positioned appropriately on the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the left arm (on the viewer's right side) is present and extends downward from the shoulder area, forming a natural-looking position relative to the torso. The arm is composed of sushi pieces arranged in a straight line, consistent with the expected shape of a human arm. While it is not raised like the right arm, its placement and orientation are appropriate for a standing figure with one arm raised. This aligns with typical human posture where one arm may be elevated while the other remains at the side. Thus, the left arm is both present and positioned appropriately.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are both legs of the person figure clearly represented by sushi pieces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, two distinct leg-like structures are visible beneath the torso. Each leg is formed from a sequence of sushi pieces arranged vertically, resembling the shape of human legs. The left leg (on the viewer's right) and the right leg (on the viewer's left) are both clearly defined and extend downward from the lower part of the torso. The use of different sushi types (such as black seaweed-wrapped rolls and others with visible fillings) adds contrast and clarity to the leg forms. Given their symmetrical placement and clear separation, both legs are unambiguously represented.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the head of the person figure represented by sushi pieces and distinguishable?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the figure is located at the top of the torso and is composed of a single sushi piece or a small cluster of pieces. It is visually distinct due to its rounded shape and central position above the shoulders, which matches the expected location of a human head. The sushi used appears to be a combination of salmon and possibly avocado or other ingredients, forming a compact and identifiable shape. Although simplified, the head is clearly separated from the rest of the body and serves as a recognizable feature of the figure. This aligns with common artistic representations where minimalistic elements are used to denote key features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
