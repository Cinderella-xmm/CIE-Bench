    "Question": "Q1: Is the astronaut rendered in a cartoon style with simplified features, bold lines, or exaggerated proportions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is depicted with clean, stylized lines and a consistent color palette that emphasizes form over photorealism. The facial features are simplified compared to realistic human anatomy—eyes are large and defined, and the overall expression is idealized. The limbs and suit have bold outlines, and the proportions are slightly exaggerated for visual impact (e.g., the pose is dynamic and heroic). These characteristics align with typical cartoon or comic book art styles, where clarity and expressiveness take precedence over anatomical precision. The use of flat shading and limited texture further supports this interpretation. This contrasts with photorealistic depictions, which aim for accurate detail and natural lighting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible action zig-zag lines surrounding the astronaut’s limbs or body to indicate motion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, two blue zig-zag lines are present—one near the astronaut’s left arm and another near the right side of the image. These lines are stylized and angular, resembling classic comic book 'motion lines' used to convey energy, speed, or dynamic movement. Such elements are common in illustrated media to suggest action without relying on animation. They are not part of the astronaut’s suit or environment but are added graphic elements meant to enhance the sense of dynamism. These lines are clearly visible and intentionally placed to emphasize motion, which is consistent with the artistic conventions of cartoon or comic illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the astronaut’s suit feature decorative celestial motifs such as stars, planets, or galaxies in blue and silver tones?",
    "explanation": "The astronaut's suit in Image B includes decorative elements that resemble stars and cosmic patterns, particularly on the legs and lower torso. These motifs are rendered in blue and silver hues, blending with the metallic sheen of the suit. The stars are stylized and repeated in a patterned fashion, suggesting a thematic design choice rather than functional equipment. While no full galaxies or planets are visible, the presence of star-like shapes integrated into the suit’s design indicates a deliberate aesthetic choice to incorporate celestial imagery. This is consistent with artistic interpretations of space exploration that emphasize wonder and fantasy.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the moon surface beneath the astronaut depicted in an illustrated, non-photorealistic style with simplified or graphic elements?",
    "explanation": "The moon surface in Image B is shown as a semi-circular shape at the bottom of the frame, with craters represented by simple circular indentations. The texture is minimal and lacks the fine detail, shadowing, and depth found in real lunar terrain. Instead, it uses flat shading and clear outlines, characteristic of illustrative or graphic design. The overall appearance is stylized and schematic, not aiming for realism but rather for visual clarity and thematic consistency with the rest of the artwork. This approach aligns with typical cartoon or poster-style illustrations where simplification enhances readability and artistic impact.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the image include a space-themed border (e.g., stars, planets, rockets) and a visible textured white background resembling card stock?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a dark border around the entire composition, decorated with small white stars scattered across it, creating a space-themed frame. This border is consistent with the cosmic theme of the illustration. Inside the border, the background is white with a subtle texture that resembles paper or card stock, giving the impression of a printed or hand-drawn piece. This textured effect adds to the tactile quality of the image, mimicking physical media like watercolor paper or matte card. The combination of the starry border and textured interior background reinforces the artistic, collectible nature of the image, often seen in illustrated cards or posters.",
    "answer": "Yes"
