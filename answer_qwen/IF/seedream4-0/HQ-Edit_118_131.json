      "question": "Is the entire scene, including the elephant teapot and base, enclosed within a curved glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant teapot is clearly positioned under a large, transparent, curved glass dome that covers the entire setup. The dome is supported by a decorative metal frame with vine-like patterns, and it encloses not only the teapot but also the base beneath it. The presence of reflections on the glass surface and the way light interacts with it confirms its transparency and curvature. Additionally, the base appears to be fully contained within this dome, as no part of the base extends outside the visible boundary of the glass. This structure suggests a display case or terrarium-like environment, which is consistent with the idea of a sealed enclosure. Based on visual cues such as the dome’s shape, transparency, and containment of all elements, the conclusion is that the entire scene is enclosed.",

      "question": "Are there visible gears and copper-colored accents added to the surface of the elephant teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the elephant teapot in Image B, the side facing the viewer reveals exposed mechanical components, including multiple interlocking gears made of a brass or copper-colored material. These gears are integrated into the body of the teapot, suggesting a steampunk aesthetic. Additionally, copper-colored accents are visible along the edges of the handle, around the joints, and in decorative bands across the body. These metallic tones contrast with the silver-gray base material of the teapot, highlighting the intentional design choice to incorporate mechanical and ornamental elements. In contrast, Image A shows a more traditional, purely ornate design without any visible gears or copper accents. Therefore, the addition of gears and copper coloring is a clear modification in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the base feature simulated wooden floorboards with scattered tea leaves and tiny silver utensils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B is constructed from what appears to be simulated wooden planks arranged in a horizontal pattern, mimicking a rustic floor. Scattered across this surface are dark, dried tea leaves, adding to the thematic detail of the scene. Additionally, small silver utensils—such as miniature spoons and possibly tweezers—are placed on the base, contributing to the intricate, curated appearance. These elements are not present in Image A, where the base is simply a smooth, white fabric-covered surface. The inclusion of these details in Image B enhances the narrative of a functional yet artistic tea set, possibly hinting at a ritualistic or fantastical context. The visual clarity of the wood grain, tea leaves, and utensils confirms their presence.",

      "question": "Are soft moss accents visibly embedded in the base area inside the glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the base area of Image B, patches of green moss are clearly visible, particularly near the edges of the wooden platform and along the inner rim of the dome’s base. These moss accents appear soft and natural, contrasting with the metallic and wooden textures. They are strategically placed to enhance the organic, almost enchanted forest-like atmosphere of the scene. The moss is integrated into the base structure, suggesting deliberate design rather than accidental placement. In Image A, there is no moss or vegetation; the base is plain and unadorned. Thus, the presence of moss is a significant addition in Image B, aligning with the theme of nature intertwined with mechanical artistry.",

      "question": "Is there visible steam emanating from the tip of the elephant’s trunk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a faint wisp of white vapor is seen rising from the tip of the elephant’s trunk, indicating the presence of steam. This visual cue is consistent with the idea of hot liquid being poured or heated within the teapot. The steam is subtle but clearly distinguishable against the darker background and the reflective surface of the glass dome. In Image A, there is no such steam, and the scene appears static and cool. The addition of steam in Image B introduces a dynamic element, suggesting functionality and warmth, reinforcing the teapot's role as a working object. This detail enhances the realism and narrative depth of the image.",

      "question": "Is the scene surrounded by intricate, vine-like metalwork that forms part of the dome or base structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outer structure of the glass dome in Image B is adorned with elaborate, vine-like metalwork that wraps around the base and curves upward along the sides of the dome. These metal vines are detailed with leaf and tendril motifs, giving them an organic yet crafted appearance. They are integrated into the overall design, forming both a decorative border and structural support for the glass. This metalwork is absent in Image A, where the teapot rests on a simple cloth without any surrounding framework. The presence of this intricate metalwork in Image B adds a layer of fantasy and craftsmanship, blending natural and mechanical themes. The visual continuity between the vines and the rest of the structure confirms they are an integral part of the dome and base.",
