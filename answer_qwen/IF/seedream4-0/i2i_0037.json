      "question": "Does the image have a white border frame surrounding it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, there is a distinct white border surrounding the entire image, which frames the central content (the dessert). This border is uniform in width and color, consistent with a digital or physical frame often used in photo editing to mimic formats like Polaroid prints. The presence of this border is clearly visible and separates the image content from the background, indicating that it is intentionally added as part of the presentation style.",

      "question": "Is there a handwritten caption at the bottom of the image that reads “Banana Cream Dream 2024”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of Image B, below the main photograph, there is text written in a cursive, light brown font that reads 'Banana Cream Dream 2024'. The style of the text mimics handwriting, suggesting an intentional aesthetic choice to give a personal or nostalgic feel. The placement and design are consistent with captions commonly found on edited photos or digital Polaroids, confirming its presence and content.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit a light brown vintage filter that gives the appearance of a film-style photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a warm, slightly desaturated tone with a light brownish tint across the entire image. This color grading softens the contrast and enhances the nostalgic, aged look typical of film photography. The lighting appears softer than in standard digital images, and the shadows and highlights are muted, which aligns with the characteristics of vintage filters used to simulate analog film effects. This visual cue strongly suggests the application of a vintage filter.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the image presented in a Polaroid style with the combination of the white border frame and vintage filter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image combines multiple elements characteristic of a Polaroid-style presentation: a white border frame, a vintage film-like filter, and a handwritten caption at the bottom. These features are iconic components of the Polaroid aesthetic—commonly seen in instant photo prints where the border, warm tones, and handwritten notes contribute to a retro, personal feel. The integration of these elements in Image B confirms that it is styled to resemble a Polaroid photograph.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the original dessert appearance been preserved without any changes apart from the added frame, caption, and filter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A (the original), the dessert itself—the slice of cheesecake, whipped cream, banana slices, and plate—appears visually unchanged in terms of composition and arrangement. The only differences are the added white border, the vintage filter altering the color tone, and the handwritten caption. No alterations to the dessert’s shape, texture, or placement are evident. Therefore, the core visual content of the dessert remains intact, with only stylistic enhancements applied.",
