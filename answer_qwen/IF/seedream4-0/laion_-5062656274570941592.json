      "question": "Are the figures made of a smooth, glossy material consistent with fine porcelain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in Image B exhibit a highly reflective, smooth surface with a lustrous finish that is characteristic of fine porcelain. This is evident from the way light interacts with their surfaces—creating soft highlights and uniform sheen—especially noticeable on the faces, robes, and limbs. Porcelain is known for its delicate translucency and polished appearance, which aligns with the visual texture observed here. Additionally, the figures are uniformly white with gold accents, a common design feature in high-quality porcelain religious figurines. These attributes strongly suggest the material is fine porcelain rather than wood or plastic.",

      "question": "Are there visible gold leaf embellishments on the garments and halos of the figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, gold detailing is clearly visible along the edges of the garments, halos, and certain decorative elements such as the star above the grotto and the crown-like motif around the infant’s head. The gold appears thin and applied with precision, consistent with gold leaf application—a technique commonly used in luxury porcelain art to add elegance and contrast. The halos around Mary and Joseph, as well as the trim on their robes and the base of the scene, all display this metallic finish. This level of detail supports the presence of gold leaf embellishments.",

      "question": "Has the wooden structure been replaced with a marble-like grotto featuring polished stone texture and architectural details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure surrounding the nativity scene is no longer wooden. Instead, it features a white, veined material resembling marble, complete with classical architectural elements such as fluted columns and ornate arches. The surface has a polished, reflective quality typical of marble, and the overall design includes sculpted details like scrollwork and decorative capitals on the columns. This contrasts sharply with the simple, rustic wooden construction seen in typical hand-carved nativity scenes. The transformation from wood to a refined, stone-like grotto is evident and aligns with the luxurious aesthetic of the entire piece.",

      "question": "Are there engraved decorative motifs visible on the columns and base of the grotto?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The columns in Image B are adorned with subtle, intricate engravings that resemble floral or symbolic patterns, possibly depicting religious iconography or ornamental designs. These motifs are etched into the surface of the marble-like material and are more detailed than plain carving. Similarly, the base of the grotto features elaborate gold-embossed scrollwork and foliate patterns, which are not just painted but appear to be carved or molded into the surface. These decorative elements contribute to the opulent style of the piece and confirm the presence of engraved or sculpted motifs.",

      "question": "Is the nativity scene presented within a box that has velvet lining and visible elegant branding on the exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the nativity scene placed inside a dark purple box with a rich, plush velvet interior, which serves both as a protective case and an elegant display element. On the upper part of the box lid, there is a gold emblem featuring a crown and the text 'Canna Preziosi,' indicating a brand name associated with high-end religious artifacts. The use of velvet lining and prominent branding suggests this is a premium product intended for display or gift-giving. These visual cues confirm that the scene is indeed housed in a branded, velvet-lined box.",
