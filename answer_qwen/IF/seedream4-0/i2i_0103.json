      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the entire scene—including the sofa, walls, plant, and artwork—displays a textured appearance characterized by thick, directional strokes. These strokes are not smooth or photorealistic but instead resemble impasto techniques commonly seen in oil paintings. The lines are visibly layered and follow dynamic directions, especially noticeable in the sky, wall patterns, and even on the fabric of the couch. This effect is consistent with digital art that mimics Van Gogh's painting style, where brushwork is intentionally exaggerated and visible. Based on visual cues such as texture, stroke direction, and layering, it is clear that brushstrokes are not only present but dominant across the image.",

      "question": "Are there distinct, exaggerated differences between light and dark areas in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a strong contrast between light and dark regions, particularly evident in the swirling blue and white patterns on the wall and ceiling, which mimic the dramatic chiaroscuro effects often found in Van Gogh’s work. The lighting on the sofa and plant also shows sharp transitions from bright highlights to deep shadows, enhancing the three-dimensionality through contrast rather than subtle gradients. Additionally, the lamp emits a warm glow that sharply contrasts with the cooler surrounding tones. This heightened contrast is stylistic and intentional, aligning with Van Gogh’s expressive use of light and shadow to create emotional impact. Therefore, the differences between light and dark areas are not only distinct but exaggerated for artistic effect.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the elements within the edited image, such as the sky, clouds, and landscape, display swirling patterns or dynamic lines characteristic of Van Gogh's style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The painted elements in Image B—especially the wall background and the framed artwork—feature pronounced swirling patterns and dynamic, curvilinear lines. The sky and clouds are rendered with spiraling motions, reminiscent of 'Starry Night,' one of Van Gogh’s most famous works. The mountainous landscape within the framed painting also uses undulating, rhythmic strokes to convey movement and energy. Even the furniture and plant are stylized with flowing, curved textures that echo these motifs. This consistent use of swirling forms and energetic lines directly reflects Van Gogh’s signature technique of using motion and rhythm to evoke emotion. Thus, the visual evidence strongly supports that these elements exhibit Van Gogh-like characteristics.",

      "question": "Are the colors in the edited image vibrant and expressive, deviating from the original realistic palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a highly saturated color scheme dominated by intense blues, yellows, and oranges, especially in the sky, wall, and furniture. These hues are more vivid and emotionally charged than those in a typical realistic interior setting. For example, the blue walls have a rich, almost electric tone, while the yellow accents in the sky and lampshade appear luminous and exaggerated. This departure from naturalistic coloration aligns with Van Gogh’s known preference for expressive, non-literal color choices to convey mood and atmosphere. In contrast, realistic interiors (like Image A) would use more subdued, true-to-life tones. The vibrancy and emotional intensity of the colors in Image B clearly indicate a shift toward an expressive, artistic palette.",

      "question": "Is the entire edited image consistently styled in a way that resembles Van Gogh's distinctive artistic techniques and style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire composition of Image B—including the furniture, walls, plant, and framed artwork—is uniformly transformed into a painterly style that closely mirrors Van Gogh’s techniques. Key features such as visible brushstrokes, swirling patterns, high contrast, and expressive colors are applied consistently across all elements. Even the floor and rug show textural strokes, maintaining stylistic coherence. There are no parts of the image that retain a photographic or realistic quality; every object is rendered as if painted with thick, expressive strokes. This comprehensive transformation ensures that the overall aesthetic is faithful to Van Gogh’s artistic approach, making the entire scene feel like a single painted canvas rather than a digitally altered photograph.",
