      "question": "Has the man's form been cartoonized with exaggerated proportions such as an enlarged head, simplified facial features, or distorted body shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man riding the scooter has a notably larger head in proportion to his body compared to typical human anatomy. His facial features are simplified—such as the wide, smiling mouth and large, round eyes—which are characteristic of cartoon-style illustrations. Additionally, his nose is exaggeratedly prominent, and the overall expression is highly stylized rather than realistic. These visual cues align with common cartoonization techniques where features are amplified for expressive effect. Compared to Image A, where the man appears more realistically proportioned with naturalistic facial details, Image B clearly employs stylistic exaggeration. This shift indicates intentional cartoonization.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scooter's details exaggerated, such as oversized parts, stylized chrome, or unrealistic proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scooter in Image B retains the general shape and structure of a classic Vespa but exhibits subtle stylization. The chrome elements appear slightly more pronounced and reflective than would be typical in a photograph, suggesting artistic enhancement. However, the proportions of the scooter’s components—such as the front fender, wheels, and handlebars—are consistent with real-world design and do not appear overly exaggerated. While there is some stylization in lighting and shine, especially on the red paint and metallic parts, these effects serve aesthetic purposes rather than distorting the scooter’s realism. In comparison to Image A, where the scooter looks more photorealistic with balanced detailing, Image B shows slight embellishment but no major distortions. Therefore, the scooter is not significantly exaggerated.",

      "question": "Is the overall image rendered in sepia tones, with a consistent brownish-yellow hue across all elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a uniform sepia tone. While the background and surrounding elements have a warm, aged appearance, the colors remain vibrant—especially the red scooter and the white clothing of the man. The scene includes rich hues like deep reds, creams, and greens from plants, which deviate from the monochromatic brownish-yellow typical of sepia rendering. Instead, the image uses a selective color palette that mimics aged paper but preserves original colors. This contrasts with true sepia toning, which uniformly shifts all colors toward brown. Thus, although the image has an antique feel, it is not rendered entirely in sepia tones.",

      "question": "Do the edges of the image show a faded or worn appearance, simulating the look of an old postcard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of Image B display visible signs of aging, including uneven borders, discoloration, and slight fraying, particularly along the corners and sides. These characteristics mimic the physical wear seen in vintage postcards or aged documents. The texture around the frame suggests fading and creasing, reinforcing the illusion of age. This effect is distinct from the clean, sharp edges of Image A, which lacks any simulated wear. The visual cues in Image B strongly suggest an intentional design to replicate the look of an old postcard, making this feature evident.",

      "question": "Does the image have an ornate frame with flowing lines, organic patterns, or floral designs typical of Art Nouveau style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is enclosed within a decorative border that features intricate, swirling patterns, leaf-like motifs, and symmetrical flourishes—hallmarks of the Art Nouveau design movement. The frame includes curvilinear forms and floral elements that extend into elegant, flowing lines, especially at the corners and arches. This ornamental style is consistent with historical Art Nouveau aesthetics, often seen in early 20th-century book covers and illustrations. In contrast, Image A has no such frame, presenting a plain, unadorned border. The presence of this detailed, stylized frame in Image B confirms its alignment with Art Nouveau design principles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Below the central illustration in Image B, there is a clearly defined section with horizontal lines resembling ruled notebook paper. This area is devoid of any text, images, or additional graphics, indicating it is intended for handwritten notes or messages. This layout is common in vintage-style postcards or journal pages designed for personal use. In Image A, this space is absent, as the entire composition fills the canvas without such a functional element. The inclusion of this blank lined area in Image B supports its design as a collectible or interactive piece.",

      "question": "Is the image printed on a surface with visible parchment-like texture, including grain and subtle imperfections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background surface of Image B exhibits a textured appearance reminiscent of aged parchment, with visible grain patterns, slight discolorations, and minor blemishes that simulate paper aging. These textures are consistent across the entire image, enhancing the antique aesthetic. The surface also shows variations in tone and small spots, further reinforcing the impression of handmade or historical paper. This contrasts with Image A, which appears smooth and evenly lit, lacking any such tactile qualities. The deliberate inclusion of these imperfections suggests the image is meant to evoke the feel of an old document or sketchbook page.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows only one illustrated page framed by an ornate border, with no indication of additional cards or a stack. While the left and right edges include rope-like bindings that resemble twine, they are part of the decorative frame rather than actual binding between multiple sheets. There is no visual evidence of multiple postcards being grouped together. In contrast, Image A contains a single standalone illustration without any binding elements. The twine in Image B is purely stylistic, used to enhance the vintage book or journal theme, not to indicate a physical collection. Therefore, the image does not depict a set of bound postcards.",
