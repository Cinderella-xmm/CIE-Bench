      "question": "Is the unicorn's body rendered with a smooth, glazed, creamy white ceramic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The unicorn in Image B exhibits a glossy, uniform surface that reflects light in a way consistent with glazed ceramic. The color is a consistent creamy white, and the sheen suggests a non-porous, polished material typical of porcelain or fine ceramic. This appearance contrasts with matte or natural textures, reinforcing the conclusion that it is made of glazed ceramic. Based on visual cues such as reflections, smoothness, and color consistency, combined with common knowledge about ceramic sculptures, this assessment is supported.",

      "question": "Are the mane and tail replaced with delicate, curl-shaped porcelain elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mane and tail of the unicorn in Image B are not rendered in a naturalistic manner but instead feature stylized, tightly coiled curls. These curls are uniform in shape and appear to be sculpted from the same material as the body—porcelain—given their smooth finish and integration with the overall form. This design choice aligns with decorative porcelain art, where organic forms are often idealized and geometrically refined. The lack of realistic hair texture and the presence of defined, repeating spiral patterns support the conclusion that these features are artificial, curl-shaped porcelain elements.",

      "question": "Is the unicorn’s horn a polished metallic spiral?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horn of the unicorn in Image B is distinctly different in material and texture from the rest of the sculpture. It has a reflective, silvery surface with a spiral pattern that suggests a metallic composition. Unlike the matte or glazed ceramic of the body, the horn shows clear highlights and a sheen indicative of polished metal. The spiral structure is also consistent with a manufactured, possibly cast metal element, commonly used in artistic sculptures for contrast. Therefore, based on visual cues of reflectivity, texture, and form, the horn can be identified as a polished metallic spiral.",

      "question": "Is the background a minimalist gallery setting with neutral tones and no forest elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features clean, white walls, a light-colored floor, and soft overhead lighting typical of an art gallery. There are framed artworks visible on the walls, further indicating a curated exhibition space. The absence of trees, foliage, or any natural elements confirms that there are no forest components. The environment is characterized by simplicity and neutrality, which supports the definition of a minimalist gallery setting. This contrasts sharply with the dark, forested, moonlit scene in Image A, highlighting the intentional shift in context.",

      "question": "Does the unicorn stand on a gently textured stone base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The unicorn in Image B is positioned on a flat, irregularly shaped object that resembles natural rock. The surface has subtle variations in texture and color, with earthy tones and slight undulations, consistent with a piece of weathered stone. It is not a smooth or artificial platform but rather a naturally appearing base that complements the sculpture. This type of base is often used in display contexts to enhance realism or provide a grounding element. The visual evidence supports the conclusion that the base is gently textured and stone-like.",
