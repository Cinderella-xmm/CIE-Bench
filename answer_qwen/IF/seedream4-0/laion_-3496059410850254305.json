      "question": "Has the guitar body been transformed into an armored torso with clear armor-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar is being held by a character whose body is clad in metallic armor. However, the guitar itself remains a distinct object and has not been morphed or integrated into the armor as part of the character's torso. The guitar retains its original shape and structure, positioned across the character’s body like a weapon or instrument. While the character’s armor is detailed and prominent, there is no visual evidence that the guitar body has been transformed into armor. Therefore, the guitar is still clearly identifiable as a separate entity from the armored torso.",

      "question": "Does the guitar body exhibit a metallic, deep mahogany finish with visible reflective qualities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The guitar body in Image B displays a rich, deep mahogany wood grain finish typical of high-quality acoustic guitars. However, it does not have a metallic appearance. Instead, it has a polished wooden texture with natural reflections consistent with varnished wood, not metal. There are no visible metallic sheens or chrome-like surfaces on the body. The reflective qualities observed are due to the lighting on the wood surface, not because the material is metallic. Thus, while the finish is deep and glossy, it is not metallic.",

      "question": "Are dynamic illustrative lines present around the character to suggest motion or energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, there are dynamic illustrative elements surrounding the character in Image B. Specifically, glowing yellow-orange lines resembling sound waves emanate from the headstock area, suggesting vibrational energy or music being played. Additionally, the flowing cape and the positioning of the character imply movement, further enhanced by the radiant glow and streaks behind him. These artistic effects are common in comic book illustrations to convey action, power, or energy release. The combination of these visual cues indicates intentional depiction of motion or energy.",

      "question": "Have the guitar strings been transformed into thick, muscle-like strands wrapping around the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The guitar strings in Image B are depicted as standard thin, taut strings running from the bridge to the tuning pegs. They do not appear to be transformed into thick, muscle-like strands. Instead, they remain consistent with the appearance of real guitar strings. There is no visual evidence of them being stylized into biological or muscular forms wrapped around the character’s body. The character’s arms are bound with rope-like materials, but these are separate from the guitar strings and not connected to them. Therefore, the strings retain their original form.",

      "question": "Is there a luminous cape flowing from the neck with sound wave motifs and a bright emblem on the headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the character in Image B is wearing a luminous, golden-yellow cape that flows dramatically behind him, originating from his shoulders and extending outward. This cape appears to be illuminated, possibly symbolizing energy or power. On the headstock of the guitar, there is a bright, glowing emblem shaped like a flame or star, which emits light and contributes to the overall heroic aesthetic. Additionally, sound wave motifs are visible near the headstock, reinforcing the theme of music or sonic energy. These elements together support the description of a luminous cape and symbolic design on the headstock.",

      "question": "Is the overall shape of the guitar still recognizable, including the headstock, neck, and body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, despite the artistic stylization, the guitar in Image B maintains all the key structural components of a standard acoustic guitar. The body has the classic dreadnought shape with a cutaway, the neck extends straight from the body to the headstock, and the headstock features tuning pegs arranged in a traditional pattern. Even though the guitar is integrated into a dramatic scene with a superhero figure, its silhouette and proportions remain faithful to a real-world acoustic guitar. The visual clarity of each part confirms that the instrument’s overall shape is fully recognizable.",
