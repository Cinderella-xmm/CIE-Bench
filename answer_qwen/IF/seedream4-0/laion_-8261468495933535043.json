      "question": "Are the sausages, salad, and egg completely replaced by glass tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements that resemble sausages, salad, and an egg are constructed entirely from glass tiles arranged in a mosaic pattern. The sausages are formed using elongated orange and reddish-brown tiles, the salad is composed of various green tiles mimicking leafy textures, and the egg is represented by white tiles with yellow circular tiles forming the yolk. There are no actual food items present—everything is made of tile material. This transformation from real food to a mosaic representation indicates a complete replacement. Based on world knowledge, mosaics use small pieces of materials like glass or stone to create images, and here, the original food items have been artistically recreated using such techniques.",

      "question": "Are the tiles used for the sausage shapes in warm terracotta tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sausage-shaped sections in Image B are composed of rectangular glass tiles in shades ranging from deep orange to reddish-brown, with some lighter peachy hues. These colors fall within the spectrum of warm terracotta tones, which are earthy and typically include reds, oranges, and browns. The color palette matches common terracotta pigments, especially those found in ceramic or glazed materials. Given that terracotta is often associated with warm, baked-earth colors, and these tiles visually align with that description, it is accurate to say they are in warm terracotta tones.",

      "question": "Are the tiles forming the salad in leafy green colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The salad portion of the mosaic in Image B is made up of numerous small square tiles in various shades of green—from light lime green to dark forest green—some with translucent qualities. These variations mimic the natural color diversity seen in fresh lettuce and other greens. Additionally, there are red tiles representing cherry tomatoes, consistent with typical salad components. The use of multiple green hues reflects the texture and variety of leafy vegetables. Thus, based on visual cues and world knowledge about how salads appear and how artists represent them in mosaics, the tiles are indeed in leafy green colors.",

      "question": "Is the egg-shaped area composed of round tiles in sunny yellow tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The egg-shaped section in Image B consists of white tiles forming the egg white and a cluster of round, yellow-tinted tiles at the center representing the yolk. These yellow tiles are distinctly circular and vary slightly in shade, resembling the appearance of a cooked egg yolk. While not all tiles are round (the whites are mostly square), the central yolk area uses round tiles in sunny yellow tones, which accurately reflect the intended representation. In mosaic art, round tiles are often used to depict spherical objects like yolks. Therefore, the key feature—the yolk—is composed of round, sunny yellow tiles as described.",

      "question": "Are the tiles used for the sausages visibly larger than those used for the lettuce?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection, the tiles forming the sausages are rectangular and significantly larger in size compared to the smaller, square or irregularly shaped tiles used for the lettuce. The sausage tiles are uniform in shape and size, creating a smooth, continuous surface, while the lettuce tiles are much smaller and varied, allowing for detailed texture simulation. This difference in scale is intentional in mosaic design to differentiate forms and add depth. Based on visual comparison, the sausage tiles are clearly larger than the lettuce tiles.",

      "question": "Is the mosaic composition arranged symmetrically on a plain ceramic background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of the mosaic in Image B does not exhibit symmetry. The sausages curve asymmetrically, the salad is loosely grouped without balanced distribution, and the egg is placed off-center relative to the other elements. The overall layout appears organic and freeform rather than symmetrical. Furthermore, the background is plain white but not clearly identifiable as ceramic—it could be any flat, neutral surface. While the background is plain, the lack of symmetry in the composition means the arrangement is not symmetrical. Symmetry would require mirrored or balanced placement, which is absent here.",

      "question": "Does the image display a vibrant and artistically cohesive mosaic design using glass tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a creative interpretation of a meal using glass tiles in a mosaic style. The use of color—warm oranges for sausages, varying greens for lettuce, and bright yellows for the egg yolk—creates a visually vibrant effect. The tiles are carefully arranged to form recognizable food items, demonstrating artistic cohesion. The reflective quality of the glass adds depth and shine, enhancing the aesthetic appeal. From a world knowledge perspective, mosaics are valued for their ability to transform everyday subjects into art through pattern and color. This piece successfully achieves that goal, making it both vibrant and artistically coherent.",
