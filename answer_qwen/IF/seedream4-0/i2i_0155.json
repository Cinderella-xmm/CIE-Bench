      "question": "Is the text \"Breathe\" added at the top left corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Breathe' is clearly visible in the upper left portion of the frame. It is positioned near the top edge and aligned to the left side of the image. The font is white, serif-style, and contrasts subtly against the darker wall background, making it legible without overpowering the scene. Based on visual inspection, the placement matches the description of being in the top left corner. This positioning aligns with common design practices for motivational or thematic text in calming imagery, where such words are placed unobtrusively yet noticeably. No other text appears in that region, confirming its presence and location.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Calm' is visible in the lower right section of the image. It is positioned close to the bottom edge and aligned to the right side. The font is grayish, slightly smaller than 'Breathe', and blends softly into the shadowed area of the windowsill. Its placement does not interfere with the plant or window but uses negative space effectively. Given its position relative to the frame’s edges, it can be accurately described as being in the bottom right corner. This placement complements the top-left 'Breathe' text, creating a balanced textual composition that enhances the meditative theme.",

      "question": "Does the text \"Breathe\" and \"Calm\" use fonts, colors, and sizes suitable for a plant therapy and meditation theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fonts used for both 'Breathe' and 'Calm' are elegant serif styles, which are often associated with calmness, mindfulness, and natural aesthetics—common in wellness and meditation contexts. 'Breathe' is in white, which stands out gently against the dark wall, while 'Calm' is in a muted gray, blending harmoniously with the shadows. The size of 'Breathe' is larger and more prominent, suggesting emphasis on the act of breathing, a key component of meditation. 'Calm' is smaller, reinforcing a sense of subtlety and peace. Together, these choices reflect thoughtful design decisions typical of plant therapy and meditation themes, where clarity, serenity, and minimalism are prioritized. The combination of soft contrast, readable typography, and intentional sizing supports the intended emotional tone.",

      "question": "Do the added texts \"Breathe\" and \"Calm\" blend well with the plant and window setting, maintaining the calming atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of the texts 'Breathe' and 'Calm' does not disrupt the serene ambiance created by the natural lighting, green plant, and soft window view. The white 'Breathe' text contrasts lightly with the dark wall, drawing attention without being jarring, while 'Calm' in gray integrates seamlessly into the shaded area beneath the windowsill. Both texts are positioned in areas of negative space, avoiding overlap with the plant or window. Their minimalist style and subtle coloration enhance rather than distract from the natural elements. The overall effect is one of quiet encouragement, aligning with the calming atmosphere suggested by the sunlight filtering through the leaves and the peaceful indoor setting. Thus, the texts complement the scene effectively.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the texts \"Breathe\" and \"Calm\" positioned in a way that does not obscure the central visual elements of the plant and window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central visual elements—the potted plant and the window—are fully visible and unobstructed in Image B. 'Breathe' is located in the top left corner, above the plant and away from the main foliage, while 'Calm' is in the bottom right, below the plant and outside the primary light path. Neither text overlaps with the plant's leaves, pot, or the windowpane. The placement ensures that the viewer’s focus remains on the plant and the natural light coming through the window, which are the dominant features of the image. The texts serve as supplementary elements that reinforce the mood without interfering with the composition. This strategic positioning respects the visual hierarchy, keeping the plant as the focal point.",
