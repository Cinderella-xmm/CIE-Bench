      "question": "Is the image formatted as a cereal box design with visible box-like structure or paneling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image does not display any visible box-like structure, paneling, or edges that would suggest it is formatted as a cereal box. Instead, it appears to be a flat promotional graphic with characters centered on a platform. While the overall composition resembles a product advertisement, there are no visual cues such as folds, flaps, or side panels typically associated with a cereal box. The background and layout are designed to resemble an urban basketball court rather than a physical product packaging. Therefore, based on visual analysis and common knowledge of cereal box design elements, this image is not formatted as a cereal box.",

      "question": "Has the background been replaced with an urban sports scene featuring graffiti-style elements such as spray paint art, street markings, or urban structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the background in Image B has been clearly replaced with an urban sports scene. Visual cues include a detailed basketball court with wooden flooring, multiple basketball hoops, chain-link fences, and buildings covered in colorful graffiti art. These elements—such as spray-painted tags, murals, and urban architecture—are characteristic of a city streetball environment. This contrasts sharply with the original image's simpler, more pastoral setting with grass, flowers, and a sky backdrop. The transformation reflects a shift from a whimsical outdoor field to a vibrant urban basketball court, aligning with typical 'street sports' aesthetics.",

      "question": "Is the text “Basketball Breakfast Blitz!” displayed in bold font across the top of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the text 'Basketball Breakfast Blitz!' is prominently displayed at the top of the image in large, bold, yellow letters with a red outline and white shadow, giving it a dynamic, eye-catching appearance. This style is consistent with branding used in energetic, youth-oriented promotions, especially for games or themed products. The placement and styling are designed to immediately draw attention, suggesting it is part of a title or slogan for a game or event. This matches the description in the question exactly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, Patrick’s shirt in Image B features a pattern of basketballs, hoops, and other court-related designs. The white tank top is adorned with small illustrations of basketballs, nets, and possibly dribble lines, which are clearly basketball-themed. This is a significant change from his original plain white tank top with just the number '3'. The addition of these motifs aligns with the 'Basketball Breakfast Blitz' theme, integrating sporty visuals into his attire to match the overall concept.",

      "question": "Are SpongeBob’s shoes replaced with sneakers that visibly feature cereal loop patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, SpongeBob’s shoes have been replaced with sneakers that visibly feature cereal loop patterns. The sneakers are orange and black with circular shapes resembling breakfast cereal rings, particularly reminiscent of brands like Frosted Flakes or similar loop-shaped cereals. This detail ties directly into the 'Breakfast Blitz' theme, merging basketball culture with breakfast cereal imagery. The design is intentional and thematic, combining the two concepts in a playful way.",

      "question": "Are there illustrated cereal hoops (ring-shaped cereal pieces) depicted flying around SpongeBob and Patrick?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, there are multiple ring-shaped cereal pieces illustrated as if they are flying through the air around SpongeBob and Patrick. These cereal loops are scattered throughout the scene, appearing near the basketballs and around the characters. Their presence reinforces the 'Breakfast Blitz' theme by blending breakfast cereal imagery with the basketball action. This creative element suggests a fusion of food and sports, likely intended to appeal to children and promote a playful, energetic atmosphere.",
