      "question": "Is the bed fully constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, including the frame, mattress, and base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire structure of the bed—including the headboard, frame, base, and mattress—is visibly composed of interlocking LEGO bricks. The construction shows consistent brick patterns with stud details typical of LEGO pieces. The frame is built from white bricks forming a rectangular base with vertical supports, while the mattress and pillows are made from light blue and white bricks stacked in uniform layers. There are no non-LEGO materials visible, suggesting that every component is recreated using LEGO elements. This conclusion is supported by the modular nature of the design, where each part fits together like standard LEGO construction.",

      "question": "Are white and light blue LEGO bricks used to recreate the botanical pattern visible on the original bedding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the bedding features a subtle botanical pattern in light blue on a white background. In Image B, the LEGO recreation uses only solid-colored bricks—white and light blue—but does not incorporate any intricate design or pattern resembling leaves or flowers. Instead, the bricks are arranged in solid blocks, with the light blue bricks forming a large section of the 'mattress' and 'pillows'. While the color scheme matches the original (white and light blue), there is no attempt to replicate the detailed botanical pattern through brick arrangement. Therefore, the pattern is not recreated, only the general color palette is preserved.",

      "question": "Has the headboard been replaced with smooth, curved LEGO pieces to create a rounded shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headboard is clearly constructed from LEGO bricks, but it features a curved top edge formed by arched LEGO pieces, which are specifically designed for creating smooth curves in LEGO builds. These curved pieces give the headboard a rounded silhouette, contrasting with the straight-edged headboard in Image A. This use of specialized LEGO curved elements indicates a deliberate design choice to create a smooth, rounded shape, which is not possible with standard rectangular bricks alone. Thus, the headboard has indeed been redesigned with curved LEGO components.",

      "question": "Are the pillows made from stacked smaller LEGO bricks, giving them a distinct three-dimensional structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pillows are constructed from multiple layers of small, light blue LEGO bricks stacked vertically. The stacking creates a raised, blocky form that mimics the volume of real pillows. The individual studs on the bricks are visible, and the structure appears deliberately layered to simulate depth and dimensionality. This contrasts with flat representations, indicating a three-dimensional build. The use of smaller bricks allows for finer detail and more defined shape, reinforcing the 3D appearance.",

      "question": "Is the background of the edited image the same grayscale as the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B feature a neutral, minimalist background. In Image A, the background is a uniform light gray, providing a clean, unobtrusive setting. In Image B, the background is visually identical in tone and lighting—same shade of gray, no additional elements, and consistent lighting. There is no visible change in color, texture, or brightness between the two images. This suggests that the background was preserved exactly as in the original, likely to maintain visual consistency during the transformation from real-world object to LEGO model.",

      "question": "Does the LEGO bed appear playful due to visible brick construction and structured due to orderly arrangement and clear modular design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO bed in Image B exhibits both playful and structured qualities. The visible LEGO bricks, with their characteristic studs and blocky forms, introduce a sense of playfulness and whimsy, evoking childhood creativity and toy-like charm. At the same time, the construction is highly orderly: bricks are aligned precisely, sections are uniformly stacked, and the overall design follows a modular, geometric layout. This balance between fun (playful) and precision (structured) reflects LEGO's dual nature as both a toy and a design medium. The combination of these attributes makes the bed appear both imaginative and well-engineered.",
