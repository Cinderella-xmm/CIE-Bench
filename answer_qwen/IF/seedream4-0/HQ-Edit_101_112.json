      "question": "Does the image exhibit flat color fields, bold outlines, and minimal shading consistent with traditional Japanese woodblock prints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image displays characteristics typical of traditional Japanese woodblock prints. The colors are applied in flat, uniform fields without gradients or subtle transitions, which is a hallmark of woodblock printing techniques where each color is carved into a separate block. Bold, black outlines define the shapes of the figure, basket, bridge, and trees, creating clear separation between elements—a key feature of ukiyo-e art. Shading is minimal; instead of realistic light and shadow, the image relies on line work and color blocking to suggest form. These visual cues align closely with historical woodblock print aesthetics, such as those seen in works by artists like Hiroshige or Hokusai.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figure’s facial expression calm and composed, with eyes slightly closed or downcast, indicating serene contemplation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elderly woman's face shows a tranquil expression. Her eyes are gently closed or nearly so, and her mouth is relaxed, conveying a sense of peace and introspection. This stillness, combined with the lack of tension in her features, suggests a state of quiet reflection, common in depictions of contemplative figures in traditional Japanese art. The overall mood of serenity is reinforced by the peaceful garden setting, further supporting the interpretation of her demeanor as one of calm contemplation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the kimono display intricate patterns (e.g., floral, geometric) and use vibrant, saturated colors instead of plain dark tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kimono in the image is richly patterned with a complex design that includes floral motifs and geometric arrangements in red, blue, gold, and white—colors often associated with traditional Japanese textiles. These patterns are clearly defined and highly decorative, contrasting sharply with the plain dark kimono seen in the original image. The use of bright, saturated hues and detailed ornamentation is characteristic of elaborate kimonos worn in formal or artistic contexts, especially in woodblock prints where visual richness is emphasized. This contrasts with more subdued, monochromatic garments typically worn in daily life.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms and the bridge rendered with stylized, non-realistic forms typical of Japanese woodblock prints (e.g., simplified petals, symmetrical bridge structure)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cherry blossoms are depicted with simplified, stylized petals that float in the air and fall around the figure, lacking the fine detail of real flowers but capturing their essence through symbolic representation—a common technique in woodblock prints. The bridge is rendered with clean lines and a symmetrical arch, emphasizing balance and harmony over architectural accuracy. Its structure appears idealized rather than realistically proportioned, reflecting the aesthetic priorities of traditional Japanese art, where composition and symbolism take precedence over photorealism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire image have a visible textured, matte surface resembling aged paper, with no glossy or reflective areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the image has a distinct texture that mimics the grainy surface of aged paper, commonly used in reproductions of historical woodblock prints. There are no signs of glossiness or reflections; instead, the lighting appears even and diffused, consistent with a matte finish. This texture enhances the vintage feel and supports the illusion of an authentic print from the Edo or Meiji period. Such surface qualities are intentionally included in modern interpretations of traditional art to evoke authenticity and timelessness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the basket been simplified into a basic, stylized form with minimal detail, consistent with traditional woodblock art representations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The basket is rendered with simple, clean lines and lacks fine textural details such as individual woven strands or shadows. Instead, it uses solid color blocks and uniform contours, which is typical of how objects are stylized in woodblock prints to maintain clarity and balance within the composition. While it retains recognizable form, its simplification aligns with the artistic convention of reducing complexity for visual harmony, especially when compared to a photographically accurate depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the composition balanced, with elements arranged symmetrically and proportionally to create a sense of visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition is highly balanced, with the central figure seated on a bench directly aligned with the midpoint of the frame. The bridge forms a horizontal axis across the middle ground, while the river flows symmetrically on either side. Cherry blossom branches extend from both upper corners, framing the scene evenly. The placement of the basket on the right side is mirrored subtly by the empty space on the left, contributing to a sense of equilibrium. This deliberate symmetry and proportional spacing reflect principles of harmony found in traditional Japanese aesthetics, particularly in landscape prints.",
