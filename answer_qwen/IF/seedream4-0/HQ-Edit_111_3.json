      "question": "Is the image formatted as an educational infographic with structured layout elements such as titles, labels, and text boxes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image contains a clear title at the top, 'Butterfly Biology Basics', which is formatted in a large, bold font. Below this, there are labeled text boxes connected by lines to specific parts of the butterfly, indicating an anatomical breakdown. These labels and text boxes are structured around the central illustration of the butterfly, suggesting a deliberate educational layout. The use of white text boxes with black text and arrows pointing to features of the butterfly indicates a formal infographic design. This structured format—title, annotations, and explanatory text—is characteristic of educational infographics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the title “Butterfly Biology Basics” displayed prominently at the top or center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the image, the title 'Butterfly Biology Basics' is clearly visible in a large, bold, black font centered horizontally across the image. Its placement at the top and its size relative to other elements indicate it is meant to be the main heading. This positioning is typical for titles in infographics, ensuring immediate recognition of the subject matter. Based on visual cues alone, the title is prominently displayed.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the anatomical parts (antennae, wings, abdomen, thorax) labeled with monochrome line-drawing overlays on the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in the image is depicted as a monochrome line drawing, with no color fill. Various anatomical parts such as wings, antennae, thorax, and abdomen are outlined in detail. Lines extend from these parts to small text boxes containing labels or descriptions, suggesting that the image uses overlay labeling to highlight anatomy. This technique is commonly used in scientific illustrations to emphasize structure without distraction from color. Therefore, the anatomical parts are indeed labeled using monochrome line-drawing overlays.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are pink flower petals included in the image to represent the butterfly’s feeding preference?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image includes pink flowers, specifically cosmos-like blooms, surrounding the butterfly. These flowers are visually prominent and positioned beneath the butterfly, suggesting a natural habitat where butterflies feed. In nature, butterflies are known to feed on nectar from flowers, and pink flowers are often attractive to them due to their color and accessibility. The inclusion of these flowers in the context of a biology-focused infographic implies they are included to illustrate feeding behavior or preferences. Thus, the presence of pink petals supports the idea of representing feeding preferences.",

      "question": "Are there text boxes in the image that explain the butterfly’s role in pollination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Several text boxes are present in the image, but their content appears garbled or nonsensical (e.g., 'Feeding: The Rowie...'). Despite the illegibility, the structure suggests attempts at explaining biological concepts. However, upon closer inspection, none of the visible text boxes contain coherent information about pollination. While some boxes mention feeding or anatomy, there is no clear, readable explanation linking the butterfly to pollination. Given the requirement for clarity and relevance, and based on the actual legible content, there is no verifiable explanation of pollination in the image.",

      "question": "Is the overall visual style delicate, with the butterfly’s vibrant blue color clearly emphasized as the central focal point?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall visual style of the image is not delicate in the sense of softness or subtlety. Instead, it combines a detailed line drawing of the butterfly with bold text and numerous annotations. The butterfly itself is no longer vibrant blue; it has been replaced with a black-and-white outline. The original vivid blue color is absent, which contradicts the idea of emphasizing the butterfly’s vibrant hue. Although the background retains naturalistic greenery and pink flowers, the central butterfly lacks the color emphasis that would make it the focal point. Therefore, the visual style is more technical and informative than delicate or color-emphasized.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly has been replaced with a monochrome line drawing, lacking the original vibrant blue coloration seen in Image A. While the shape and form of the butterfly remain intact, the original vivid coloring and texture are missing. The blue hues that made the butterfly stand out in the original image are completely absent. Therefore, although the butterfly's structure is preserved, the original vibrant blue butterfly is not clearly visible or intact in the edited version.",
