      "question": "Does the packaging resemble a Funko Pop figure box in design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B features a rectangular box with a clear plastic window on the front, allowing visibility of the contents inside. It has a cardboard backing with branding and artwork, including a character illustration and product name. The top of the box includes a hanging tab, which is typical for retail display. These design elements—clear window, hanging tab, and stylized character art—are characteristic of Funko Pop figure packaging. Additionally, the logo 'PON' with a speech bubble style and the overall aesthetic strongly mimic the Funko Pop brand identity. Therefore, based on visual cues and common knowledge of Funko Pop packaging, it closely resembles one.",

      "question": "Is the text \"HEALING ESSENTIALS\" visible on the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the top of the packaging in Image B, the text 'HEALING ESSENTIALS' is clearly visible in bold, uppercase letters. This text appears prominently on the upper flap of the box, directly above the character illustration. The font style and placement are consistent with product labeling conventions, making it easy to read. Thus, based on direct observation of the image, the text is indeed present and legible.",

      "question": "Is the packaging illustrated from an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An isometric perspective involves a 3D representation where all three axes (length, width, height) are equally foreshortened, typically at 30-degree angles, giving a balanced view of the object's sides. In Image B, the packaging is shown at an angle that displays the front, top, and side faces, but the proportions and angles do not conform to true isometric projection. Instead, it appears to be a slightly elevated orthographic or oblique view, commonly used in product photography to emphasize depth while maintaining realistic proportions. Therefore, although the box is viewed from a 3D angle, it does not strictly follow isometric rules.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bandage inside the packaging have a chibi-style representation with oversized stitching and a cartoonish adhesive area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the packaging, there is a figurine designed to resemble a bandage. The figurine has exaggerated features such as large eyes, a small mouth, and prominent stitching across its head and body, which are hallmarks of chibi-style art. The adhesive area is depicted as a textured square with a playful, stitched pattern, further enhancing the cartoonish appearance. These stylistic choices align with chibi aesthetics, which emphasize cuteness through simplification and exaggeration. Hence, the bandage inside is indeed represented in a chibi style with cartoonish details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a realistic version of the bandage displayed outside the packaging, showing intricate details like fabric texture and adhesive surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Outside the packaging in Image B, there is a separate object that resembles a standard adhesive bandage. It has a brown, textured outer layer resembling fabric, with a central beige pad that mimics the absorbent material found in real bandages. The lighting highlights fine details such as the weave of the fabric and the slight elevation of the adhesive pad, suggesting a high level of realism. This contrasts with the stylized figurine inside the box. Based on these visual cues, this external bandage is rendered with realistic textures and proportions, consistent with a real-world bandage.",
