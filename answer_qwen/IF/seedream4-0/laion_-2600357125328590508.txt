    "Question": "Q1: Is the sock fully constructed from visible interlocking LEGO-style bricks?",
    "explanation": "Upon visual inspection of Image B, the entire structure resembles a sock but is clearly made up of individual blocky elements that are consistent in appearance with LEGO bricks. These elements are visibly interlocked, forming the shape of the sock. The texture and geometry of the surface—especially the raised studs on top of each brick—are characteristic of LEGO construction. There are no smooth or continuous surfaces typical of fabric; instead, every part of the sock's form is composed of discrete, modular blocks. This suggests the object is entirely built from LEGO-style bricks, not a traditional textile material.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the original black, gray, and white patterns of the sock retained using blocky LEGO brick shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the color scheme of the sculpture matches the original sock's design—black, gray, and white are present in the same general areas. The pattern, including the large 'K2' logo and other graphic elements, is recreated using LEGO bricks in those colors. Although the representation is pixelated due to the blocky nature of the bricks, the overall design intent is preserved. For example, the white text on the side of the sock is formed by white bricks arranged in a way that mimics the original typography. The transition between colors and the layout of the graphics are faithfully reproduced, albeit in a stylized, blocky format. This indicates that the original patterns are retained through the use of LEGO brick shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the sculpture exhibit layered, three-dimensional construction with varying brick heights to create depth?",
    "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B shows clear evidence of layered construction. Different sections of the sock—such as the heel, toe, and ankle—have varying thicknesses and contours, which are achieved by stacking LEGO bricks of different heights. For instance, the arch of the foot appears elevated compared to the sole, and the top cuff is thicker than the lower parts. These variations in height contribute to a three-dimensional form that accurately mimics the volume and curvature of a real sock. The shadows and angles also suggest depth, reinforcing the idea that the structure is not flat but built with intentional layering to simulate form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the tag at the top of the sculpture an orange LEGO brick piece?",
    "explanation": "At the very top of the sculpture, there is a small orange element that matches the position and appearance of the tag on the original sock. This orange piece has the characteristic circular studs on top, which are typical of LEGO bricks. Its placement and shape are consistent with a LEGO brick used to replicate the original sock's tag. Given that the rest of the sculpture is made of LEGO bricks, it is logical that this tag is also constructed from one, specifically an orange LEGO brick piece designed to mimic the original brand tag.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sculpture displayed upright in a clean, minimalist gallery-like environment with no clutter or distracting elements?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the sculpture placed on a white pedestal in a spacious room with neutral-colored walls and a polished floor. The lighting is soft and even, typical of a museum or art gallery setting. There are no visible distractions such as people, furniture, or other objects in the immediate vicinity. The background is minimalistic, with only faint outlines of framed artwork on distant walls, suggesting a curated exhibition space. The focus remains solely on the sculpture, indicating a deliberate presentation in a clean, gallery-like environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the sculpture display clear architectural detail such as aligned brick rows, defined edges, and intentional structural form?",
    "explanation": "The sculpture exhibits strong architectural qualities. The LEGO bricks are arranged in orderly rows, particularly noticeable along the sides and top of the sock. Edges are sharp and well-defined, especially around the heel, toe, and cuff, indicating careful construction. The transitions between different colored sections are precise, and the overall form maintains the intended silhouette of a sock. The alignment of bricks contributes to a sense of structural integrity and intentional design, resembling both a functional object and a sculptural piece. This level of detail suggests that the builder paid close attention to form and proportion, resulting in a highly structured and visually coherent creation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
