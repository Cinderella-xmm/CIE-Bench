        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top portion of the image prominently displays the text 'Ideal Home' in large, bold, black font across the upper center. This placement and styling are consistent with how a magazine cover typically presents its main title. The text is clearly legible and positioned to draw immediate attention, which aligns with standard design practices for magazine covers. Based on visual cues and common knowledge of magazine layouts, this confirms the presence of a main title.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes two vertical text elements on the left and right sides of the frame. On the left, the text 'Bedroom Inspirations' runs vertically, and on the right, 'Cozy Living' appears similarly oriented. These phrases are styled in a way that suggests they are thematic sections or categories, commonly used in home design magazines to organize content. Their placement and typography indicate they serve as section headings, aligning with typical editorial design conventions. Therefore, these are identifiable as section headings related to home design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom center of Image B, there is a text block that reads 'Price Guide: Bedroom Essentials Under $500'. This text is clearly formatted as a standalone informational module, using a different font style and positioning compared to the rest of the text. It functions as a guide or feature highlight, specifically mentioning pricing information relevant to bedroom essentials. This matches the definition of a price recommendation module commonly found in lifestyle or home decor publications.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The core bedroom elements—such as the wooden bed with white bedding, matching nightstands, pendant lights, framed landscape artwork, potted plant, and curtains—are all present in Image B. While additional text overlays have been added, the underlying scene remains visually unchanged. The arrangement, lighting, and spatial composition of the room are identical to what would be expected in the original image. Thus, despite the textual additions, the original bedroom setting has been preserved.",

      "question": "Is the image arranged in a format resembling a magazine cover, with the title, sections, and text modules properly positioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a structured layout typical of a magazine cover: a central main title ('Ideal Home') at the top, vertical section headings ('Bedroom Inspirations' and 'Cozy Living') along the sides, and a lower informational module ('Price Guide: Bedroom Essentials Under $500'). These elements are strategically placed to guide the viewer’s eye and convey content hierarchy, mirroring professional magazine design principles. The integration of these textual components over a high-quality interior photograph further reinforces the magazine cover aesthetic. Therefore, the overall arrangement closely resembles a magazine cover.",
