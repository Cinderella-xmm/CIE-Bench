      "question": "Are the cheetah figures replaced with gold-finished perfume bottles that maintain their original seated poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects on either side of the central structure are clearly shaped like cheetahs in a seated pose. However, they have a shiny, gold finish and appear to be made of a reflective material, which suggests they are stylized or decorative representations rather than actual perfume bottles. There is no visible cap, nozzle, or spray mechanism typically associated with perfume bottles. The form remains consistent with the cheetah shape from the original image, but the material and finish have changed. Based on visual cues and world knowledge, these are not perfume bottles but artistic sculptures with a metallic gold coating. Therefore, while they resemble cheetahs, they are not replaced with perfume bottles.",

      "question": "Has the botanical center been replaced with a translucent, green-tinted glass façade that has a cascading downward appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central element in Image B consists of vertical, transparent green panels arranged in a stacked manner. These panels are smooth, reflective, and have a layered appearance, resembling glass or acrylic. The color is a consistent green tint, and the way light passes through them gives a translucent quality. The arrangement creates a sense of depth and flow, particularly due to the overlapping edges and slight curvature, which contributes to a cascading visual effect. Compared to the original botanical-themed books with leaf patterns in Image A, this new central feature is entirely different in material and design. It aligns with modern architectural or decorative glass elements often used in luxury displays. Thus, the botanical center has indeed been replaced by a glass-like structure with a cascading aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Savanna Essence\" present on the bases of both objects in a chic serif font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the base of each cheetah sculpture features the text 'Savanna Essence'. The font is elegant and formal, with distinct serifs, characteristic of a classic serif typeface. The text is centered and aligned consistently on both bases, enhancing the symmetrical and luxurious presentation. This textual addition is absent in Image A, where the bases are plain. The use of such a name combined with the gold finish and refined design suggests a branding strategy typical of high-end products. Given the visual clarity and style of the lettering, it matches the description of a chic serif font.",

      "question": "Does the edited image convey an elegant and luxurious aesthetic consistent with a high-end retail perfume display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a highly polished and sophisticated composition. The gold-finished cheetah sculptures, the translucent green glass façade, and the reflective surface all contribute to a sense of opulence. The use of metallic finishes, clean lines, and symmetry evokes the style commonly seen in premium retail environments, especially for luxury fragrances. The name 'Savanna Essence' further reinforces a natural yet refined brand identity, often associated with high-end perfumes. The overall design mimics a product display where aesthetics are prioritized to attract affluent consumers. Drawing from world knowledge about luxury branding and visual merchandising, this setup is consistent with what one might expect in a high-end boutique or fragrance counter.",

      "question": "Are the two gold-finished perfume bottles symmetrically positioned on either side of the central glass façade, preserving the original spatial arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The two cheetah-shaped figures in Image B are placed symmetrically on either side of the central glass structure. Their orientation, size, and positioning mirror each other perfectly, maintaining the balanced layout seen in Image A. Although they are now gold-finished and not actual perfume bottles, their placement relative to the center remains unchanged. The central glass façade is also vertically aligned and evenly spaced between them. This symmetry preserves the original spatial arrangement, suggesting intentional design continuity. Even though the materials and finishes differ, the structural layout remains consistent with the original composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the objects appears glossy and reflective, mirroring the lower portions of the cheetah sculptures and the central glass panels. The reflections are sharp and well-defined, indicating a polished or mirrored surface. This reflective quality enhances the visual appeal and adds depth to the composition, reinforcing the luxurious feel. Such surfaces are common in professional product photography and retail displays to emphasize elegance. The clarity of the reflections confirms that the surface is designed to reflect the objects above it, contributing to the overall aesthetic.",
