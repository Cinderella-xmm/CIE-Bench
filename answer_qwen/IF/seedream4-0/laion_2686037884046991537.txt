    "Question": "Q1: Is the image formatted as a two-panel comic with the title \"The Whoopie Pie Chronicles\" displayed?",
    "explanation": "The image is clearly divided into two horizontal panels, which is a standard format for comics. The top panel shows two whoopie pies on a plate, and the bottom panel depicts one whoopie pie in motion within a kitchen setting. At the top-left corner of the image, the title 'The Whoopie Pie Chronicles' is prominently displayed in a stylized font, confirming the comic book format and title presence. This layout and text placement are consistent with typical comic strip design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the whoopie pies have cartoon-style facial expressions (eyes, mouths) and limbs to represent them as expressive characters?",
    "explanation": "In both panels, the whoopie pies are anthropomorphized. Each has large, round eyes and simple mouths drawn on their chocolate tops, giving them expressive faces. Additionally, they possess arms and legs—black stick-like limbs that allow them to stand, walk, and interact with objects such as the spatula. These features are characteristic of cartoon characters and are used to convey emotion and action, aligning with the playful tone of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the chocolate tops and creamy centers still clearly visible and used as the primary shapes for the characters’ heads and bodies?",
    "explanation": "Yes, the core structure of each character is based on the traditional whoopie pie shape: a dark brown circular chocolate cookie forming the head and body, with a white cream filling in the middle. This shape is preserved across all characters, even when limbs and facial features are added. The visual design maintains the recognizable form of a whoopie pie while transforming it into a character, ensuring that the original food item remains identifiable.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background a playful kitchen scene with recognizable kitchen elements (e.g., stove, sink, utensils)?",
    "explanation": "Panel 2 features a brightly colored kitchen environment. Visible elements include a blue stove with a pot, wooden cabinets, a sink, hanging utensils (spatula, ladle, whisk), a countertop with various items like a bowl and containers, and tiled flooring. These details create a whimsical yet realistic kitchen setting, reinforcing the narrative context of the whoopie pie’s adventure. The style is cartoonish but includes identifiable household appliances and tools.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: In the first panel, are two whoopie pie characters positioned on the edge of the plate, looking over with curious expressions?",
    "explanation": "In the top panel, two whoopie pie characters are placed side by side on a white plate. They are positioned near the edge, leaning slightly forward, with wide eyes and neutral-to-curious facial expressions. Their orientation and gaze suggest anticipation or curiosity, matching the dialogue about searching for a new flavor. This positioning and expression align with the narrative intent of exploration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does Panel 1 contain a speech bubble with the text “I heard today’s flavor is mint! Let’s find it!” written in a handwritten font?",
    "explanation": "A speech bubble is present in the upper right of Panel 1. It contains the exact text: 'I heard today's flavor is mint! Let's find it!' The font used is informal and irregular, resembling handwriting, with slight variations in stroke thickness and letter spacing. This matches the playful, hand-drawn aesthetic of the comic and is consistent with common comic book styles for dialogue.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q7: In Panel 2, does one whoopie pie character hold a kitchen spatula like a sword and appear to lead forward?",
    "explanation": "In Panel 2, a single whoopie pie character is depicted mid-stride, moving forward with dynamic posture. It holds a silver kitchen spatula in its right hand, angled upward like a sword. Its left arm is extended back, and its legs are in motion, suggesting leadership and determination. This pose, combined with the weapon-like use of the spatula, conveys a sense of heroic adventure, fitting the 'minty mountains' quest mentioned in the speech bubble.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q8: Does Panel 2 contain a speech bubble with the text “To the minty mountains!” written in a handwritten font?",
    "explanation": "Yes, Panel 2 includes a speech bubble above the running whoopie pie character. The text inside reads: 'To the minty mountains!' The font is again informal and handwritten in style, consistent with the other text in the comic. The phrasing is adventurous and humorous, playing on the idea of a quest for mint flavor, further enhancing the comedic and imaginative tone.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q9: Do all characters have bold, thick outlines and are they colored with vibrant, flat colors without gradients or shading?",
    "explanation": "All whoopie pie characters are outlined with thick, black lines that define their shapes clearly against the background. The coloring is flat and uses solid hues—dark brown for the cookies and white for the filling—with no visible gradients, shadows, or highlights. This stylistic choice is typical of 2D animation and children's cartoons, emphasizing clarity and simplicity. The lack of depth effects reinforces the playful, graphic nature of the illustration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q10: Are all text bubbles written in a handwritten font that is legible and consistent across panels?",
    "explanation": "Both speech bubbles—one in Panel 1 and one in Panel 2—use the same informal, handwritten-style font. The letters are slightly uneven, with varying line weights, mimicking actual handwriting. Despite this informality, the text remains fully legible. The consistency in font style between panels contributes to the cohesive visual narrative and artistic identity of the comic. There are no discrepancies in style or readability.",
    "answer": "Yes"
