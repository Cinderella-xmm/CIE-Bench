      "question": "Is the figurine made of a glossy, smooth ceramic material instead of knitted yarn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine exhibits a highly reflective, smooth surface with visible highlights and a uniform sheen, which are characteristic features of glazed ceramic. The texture lacks any visible knit stitches or fibrous patterns that would suggest yarn. Instead, the surface appears solid and continuous, consistent with molded ceramic. Additionally, the way light reflects off the surface—creating sharp specular highlights—supports the conclusion that it is not knitted but rather a hard, non-porous material like ceramic. This contrasts sharply with typical knitted objects, which have a matte, textured appearance due to interlocking loops of yarn.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figurine's color a vibrant terracotta tone (a rich reddish-brown)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B displays a deep, warm reddish-brown hue with a slight orange undertone, which is characteristic of terracotta. The color is consistent across the entire surface, including the decorative elements such as the braided back and tail. Terracotta is known for its earthy, rich tones, often enhanced by glazing, which gives it a slightly more vibrant and polished look. The lighting in the image further emphasizes this warmth, confirming that the color aligns with a vibrant terracotta tone rather than a muted or neutral shade.",

      "question": "Are there visible intricate floral engravings on the surface of the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the side of the figurine features raised, detailed patterns that include stylized flowers and leaf motifs. These designs are clearly embossed into the surface, forming a relief pattern that adds depth and texture. The central flower has multiple layers of petals and a defined center, surrounded by swirling foliage, indicating deliberate craftsmanship. Such intricate engravings are common in decorative ceramics, especially those inspired by traditional art styles. The clarity and precision of these patterns confirm their presence.",

      "question": "Do the eyes resemble small polished amber stones in color, texture, and appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes of the figurine in Image B are round, translucent, and exhibit a warm golden-orange hue with a subtle internal glow, similar to polished amber. They reflect light in a way that suggests a smooth, glass-like or stone-like surface, rather than painted or plastic eyes. Amber stones are known for their rich, warm tones and natural translucency, which matches the visual properties observed here. The way the light interacts with the eyes—showing soft reflections and depth—further supports the inference that they are designed to mimic polished amber stones.",

      "question": "Is the figurine placed on a simple wooden tabletop with a minimalist background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine rests on a flat surface with a visible wood grain pattern, indicative of a wooden tabletop. The wood has a natural brown tone and a smooth finish, consistent with a simple, unadorned piece of furniture. The background is plain and uniformly gray, lacking any distracting elements, which contributes to a minimalist aesthetic. This setup focuses attention solely on the figurine, reinforcing the idea of a clean, uncluttered environment. The combination of the wooden surface and neutral backdrop aligns with the description of a simple wooden tabletop and minimalist background.",
