      "question": "Is the totem pole now presented as a miniature scene within a confined space, suggesting a scaled-down 3D environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the totem pole is placed inside a glass dome on a wooden base, surrounded by moss and small ferns. This setup mimics a diorama or terrarium, which is commonly used to display natural or cultural artifacts in a controlled, miniature environment. The presence of carefully arranged natural elements like moss and ferns, along with the scale of the objects relative to the dome, suggests that this is indeed a scaled-down 3D scene designed to evoke a sense of nature and preservation. The background forest further enhances the illusion of a natural setting, but the containment within the glass dome confirms it is a curated, miniature representation rather than a full-scale outdoor scene.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the totem pole enclosed within a transparent cylindrical glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual evidence in Image B clearly shows the totem pole positioned under a large, transparent, arched glass structure that resembles a bell jar or dome. This dome is cylindrical in shape and fully encloses the totem pole and surrounding elements like moss and ferns. Such domes are typically used to protect delicate objects or create a controlled micro-environment, and their transparency allows for full visibility of the contents. The reflection and refraction of light on the surface confirm it is made of glass. Therefore, the totem pole is indeed enclosed within such a dome.",

      "question": "Are there tiny ferns and moss visible at the base of the totem pole inside the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the base of the totem pole is surrounded by green moss and several small, delicate fern fronds. These plants are arranged around the lower portion of the totem pole within the glass dome, contributing to a naturalistic aesthetic. The size and detail of these plants suggest they are miniature versions suitable for a terrarium-like setting. The texture and color of the moss and ferns are consistent with real botanical elements, reinforcing the idea that they are intentional decorative components of the scene.",

      "question": "Is there a butterfly perched on the top of the totem pole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the very top of the totem pole, just above the uppermost carved face, a butterfly is visible. It has orange and black wings with white spots, resembling a monarch butterfly. The butterfly is positioned as if resting on the edge of the carving, with its body aligned to the structure. Its presence adds a dynamic and lifelike element to the otherwise static sculpture. Given its placement and clarity, it is clearly part of the scene and not an optical illusion or artifact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image use an earthy color palette dominated by natural browns and greens, with visible wood texture and green plant accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a strong emphasis on natural tones. The totem pole itself is crafted from wood with visible grain and texture, displaying various shades of brown. The surrounding moss and ferns introduce vibrant greens that contrast softly with the wood. The base of the display is also wooden, maintaining the earthy theme. The background forest further reinforces this palette with muted browns and greens. Overall, the composition uses a harmonious blend of natural colors, textures, and materials, creating a cohesive and organic visual experience.",
