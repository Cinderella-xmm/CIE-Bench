      "question": "Are there visible flames gently flickering from the wingtips and tail of the bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's wings and tail are depicted with vibrant, flame-like extensions that appear to be actively burning. The wingtips show bright orange and yellow hues with dynamic, flowing shapes characteristic of fire, suggesting flickering motion. Similarly, the tail feathers transition into long, swirling flames that extend downward, giving a strong impression of active combustion. These visual cues—such as the gradient of color from red to yellow and the wavy, non-solid structure—are consistent with how flames are typically represented in art. Combined with world knowledge about how fire behaves (e.g., rising heat, flickering edges), this supports the conclusion that flames are indeed visible at these locations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the bird's plumage been replaced with iridescent, shimmering scales instead of solid red feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B displays a surface texture that is distinctly different from typical avian feathers. Instead of soft, layered feather structures, its body features overlapping, polygonal patterns resembling fish or reptile scales. These scales exhibit a rainbow-like sheen, reflecting multiple colors such as blue, green, purple, and red, which is characteristic of iridescence. This contrasts sharply with the uniform, matte appearance of real cardinal feathers seen in natural birds. Based on visual analysis and knowledge of biological textures, this indicates a transformation from feathers to an artificial, fantastical scale-like covering.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there distinct fiery patterns (such as flame-like designs or glowing lines) visible across the bird's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the bird’s body in Image B, intricate, swirling patterns resembling molten lava or stylized flames are clearly visible beneath the iridescent scales. These patterns follow the contours of the bird’s form and emit a warm glow, particularly along the chest and back. They are not just color gradients but structured designs that mimic actual flame motifs. This artistic choice suggests intentional symbolic representation of fire within the creature’s anatomy. Given that such patterns are not present in real birds and align with mythological depictions of fire-based creatures (like phoenixes), their presence is confirmed.",

      "question": "Do the bird's eyes appear as glowing embers with a warm, luminous glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird’s eyes in Image B are rendered as intensely bright, circular orbs emitting a deep orange-red light. Unlike normal bird eyes, which have pupils and iris details, these eyes lack realistic anatomical features and instead resemble small, incandescent coals or embers. The surrounding area is darkened to enhance contrast, making the glow more prominent. This visual effect is consistent with representations of supernatural beings or fire elements in fantasy art. Drawing from world knowledge about how glowing objects are illustrated (e.g., high brightness, no shadow inside), it is evident that the eyes are meant to be luminous and ember-like.",

      "question": "Is the branch now made of twisted, dark, glossy obsidian material instead of natural wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branch in Image B has a highly reflective, black surface with sharp, angular twists and curves that do not resemble natural wood grain or bark texture. Its smooth, glassy appearance and deep black coloration strongly suggest a volcanic origin, akin to obsidian—a naturally occurring glass formed from rapid cooling of lava. Additionally, the way light reflects off its surface creates highlights that are inconsistent with organic materials like wood. In contrast, natural branches would show pores, roughness, and variation in tone. Therefore, based on visual cues and geological knowledge, the branch appears to be composed of obsidian-like material.",

      "question": "Are the blossoms on the branch depicted as burning or emitting flames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each blossom on the branch in Image B is shown with a central point of intense light and surrounding flickering flames. The petals themselves appear charred or molten, with orange and red glows emanating from them, indicating combustion. Some buds have small flames erupting from their tips, while others seem engulfed in fire. This depiction diverges from real floral behavior and aligns with symbolic or fantastical imagery where flora interacts with elemental forces. Given that snowflakes fall around these flowers, the contrast between cold and fire emphasizes the unnatural state of the blossoms, confirming they are burning.",

      "question": "Are the burning elements (flames, glowing parts) clearly visible in contrast to the falling snowflakes in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B contains both falling snowflakes and multiple sources of fire—flames from the bird’s tail, wings, eyes, and blossoms. The snowflakes are white and delicate, contrasting sharply with the bright orange, red, and yellow tones of the flames. Despite the overlapping elements, the fire-related features stand out due to their intensity and warmth, especially against the cool blue background. This visual contrast is enhanced by lighting effects: the flames cast subtle glows, while the snowflakes remain translucent and dimmer. This juxtaposition of hot and cold elements is artistically effective and clearly distinguishable, satisfying the condition of visibility.",
