      "question": "Has the church been rendered in a semi-cartoon style with simplified shapes and stylized lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church is depicted with clean, bold outlines and flat color fills, lacking the fine textural details and shading typical of photorealistic representation. The windows, arches, and rooflines are geometrically simplified, and the overall aesthetic aligns with animation or graphic art styles. This includes exaggerated proportions and consistent line work that are characteristic of semi-cartoon or stylized illustrations. These visual cues—such as uniform colors, lack of complex shadows, and clear, defined edges—are indicative of a deliberate artistic simplification rather than a realistic rendering. Based on these observations and common knowledge of digital art styles, it is evident that the church has been rendered in a semi-cartoon style.",

      "question": "Are the architectural elements of the church perfectly symmetrical on both sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the church's design appears to be highly symmetrical along its vertical axis. The two side towers, arched windows, and decorative elements on either side of the central spire mirror each other closely. The placement of columns, rooflines, and window patterns shows balanced alignment. While minor discrepancies can sometimes occur in digital art due to artistic liberty, the overall composition adheres to strict bilateral symmetry, which is common in classical architecture and often emphasized in stylized renderings. Therefore, based on visual inspection and architectural conventions, the structure is portrayed as perfectly symmetrical.",

      "question": "Are there visible metallic gold accents applied specifically to the spires and upper parts of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spire of the church features a golden hue at its tip and along the edges of the upper sections, particularly around the cross and the triangular gables. These areas have a reflective, shiny appearance consistent with metallic gold. Additionally, the trim around the top of the tower and the base of the steeple exhibits this same golden tone, suggesting intentional use of gold-like material for emphasis. Given the visual contrast between the gold and the lighter stone tones, and the way light reflects off these surfaces, it is reasonable to conclude that metallic gold accents have been applied to highlight key architectural features.",

      "question": "Has the proportion of the church been altered to enhance its sense of grandeur and scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The church in Image B appears taller and more imposing compared to typical real-world proportions. The spire is elongated, and the vertical lines are accentuated, drawing the viewer’s eye upward. This exaggeration of height relative to width enhances the perception of grandeur. In stylized art, especially in fantasy or anime-inspired designs, architectural elements are often stretched or enlarged to emphasize majesty. The absence of surrounding context (like nearby buildings or people) further contributes to the illusion of scale. Thus, the altered proportions serve an artistic purpose to make the church appear more monumental.",

      "question": "Has the background been replaced with a celestial-themed design featuring elements like stars, galaxies, or cosmic hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is clearly not a natural sky but a digitally created scene filled with stars, nebulae, and swirling galaxies in vibrant purples, pinks, and blues. A bright meteor streaks across the sky, and distant spiral galaxies are visible, indicating a space-themed environment. This contrasts sharply with the overcast, urban backdrop seen in Image A. The inclusion of cosmic elements such as starfields and nebulae confirms that the background has been replaced with a celestial theme, likely for dramatic or fantastical effect.",

      "question": "Are there three separate architectural art prints displayed, each within a matte black frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a triptych-style display consisting of three panels arranged side by side, each framed in black. The frames are uniform in color and thickness, and the artwork is divided across them, with the central panel showing the full front of the church and the side panels extending the scene outward. The framing appears consistent with matte black finish, commonly used in modern art displays. Each panel contains a portion of the same image, suggesting they are part of a single cohesive artwork presented as three separate prints. Therefore, yes, there are three distinct prints, each in a matte black frame.",

      "question": "Are the three prints arranged in a trifold album format, with a central fold and two outer panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout in Image B consists of three panels hinged together, forming a trifold structure. The central panel is the largest and most prominent, while the two outer panels are folded inward toward it, resembling a book or screen. This configuration is characteristic of a trifold album or room divider, where the hinges allow the panels to open and close. The way the panels are angled suggests flexibility in positioning, typical of such formats. The presence of visible hinges and the symmetric folding pattern confirm that the arrangement is indeed a trifold album format.",
