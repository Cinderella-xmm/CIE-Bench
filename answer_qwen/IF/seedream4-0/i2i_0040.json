      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red bicycle is clearly visible and positioned in the same general orientation as in the original image. The frame, wheels, handlebars, seat, and accessories such as the rear rack and water bottle holder are all present and identifiable. Despite the stylized rendering, the core structure and components of the bike remain consistent with a typical road or hybrid bicycle. This suggests that the bike has been preserved in the edited version, even though it has been transformed into a cartoon-like style. The visual cues—such as the shape of the frame, the placement of the pedals, and the design of the wheels—align with real-world bicycle anatomy, confirming its presence.",

      "question": "Has the natural scene been retained in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, elements of the natural environment—such as trees, grass, and a path—are present, suggesting an outdoor park setting similar to Image A. However, these elements have been heavily stylized with simplified shapes, flat colors, and exaggerated lighting effects. For example, the tree trunk is rendered with bold outlines and minimal texture, and the grass appears as uniform green blocks rather than realistic blades. While the essence of a natural scene is preserved, the details have been abstracted for artistic effect. Therefore, the natural scene is conceptually retained but not realistically represented.",

      "question": "Does the edited version exhibit a clean aesthetic with no unnecessary details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a highly stylized and simplified design. The bicycle and background are composed of clean lines, solid color blocks, and minimal shading, eliminating fine textures and imperfections seen in real-life photography (e.g., dirt on the ground, subtle shadows, or leaf patterns). Elements like the bench and tree are reduced to basic geometric forms. This minimalist approach removes extraneous visual noise, contributing to a clean and orderly appearance. The absence of clutter or complex textures supports the conclusion that the edited version prioritizes clarity and simplicity.",

      "question": "Does the edited version convey an energetic aesthetic, such as through vibrant colors or dynamic composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses bright, saturated colors—such as vivid green grass, a striking red bike frame, and contrasting black and white components—which contribute to a lively and engaging visual experience. The lighting is enhanced with glowing highlights and soft gradients, creating a sense of vibrancy. Additionally, the composition includes a slight tilt and perspective that gives depth and movement, reinforcing a dynamic feel. The 'Start Ride' text and semi-transparent circular graphic further suggest interactivity and motion, aligning with an energetic theme. These stylistic choices collectively evoke a sense of excitement and activity.",

      "question": "Does the edited version maintain a minimalist aesthetic by focusing on essential elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image simplifies the original scene significantly. It retains only the most important components—the bicycle and the surrounding environment—while removing intricate details such as individual leaves, soil texture, or background clutter. The use of flat colors, bold outlines, and limited depth of field emphasizes key objects without distraction. This selective representation aligns with minimalist principles, where form and function are prioritized over realism. By stripping away non-essential elements, the image focuses attention on the core subject (the bike) and its immediate context, supporting a minimalist aesthetic.",
