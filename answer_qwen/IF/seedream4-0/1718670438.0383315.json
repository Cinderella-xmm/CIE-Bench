      "question": "Is the robot and its surroundings enclosed within a transparent glass bell jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is clearly visible inside a dome-shaped, transparent enclosure that resembles a glass bell jar. The curvature of the glass is evident, with reflections and light distortions typical of curved glass surfaces. The edges of the dome are smooth and seamless, consistent with a glass cover used to protect or display an object. This type of enclosure is commonly used in museum displays or decorative pieces to preserve and highlight intricate items. The presence of the glass dome is unmistakable, as it separates the robot and its base from the surrounding environment.",

      "question": "Is the robot standing on a small pedestal decorated with cogs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B is positioned on a circular base that appears to be metallic and intricately designed. Upon close inspection, the base features embossed patterns resembling gears and cogs, which are characteristic of steampunk aesthetics. These mechanical motifs are not merely decorative but suggest functional inspiration from clockwork machinery. The base itself is elevated slightly above the surface it rests on, confirming it serves as a pedestal. The cog-like design is both visually prominent and thematically consistent with the robot’s overall style.",

      "question": "Are there miniature clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils visible around the robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Around the base of the robot, several small objects are arranged. Among these are tiny mechanical devices resembling clockwork mechanisms, including a visible miniature clock face with hands and gear components. Additionally, there are coiled structures made of copper-colored wire, which resemble solenoids or inductors commonly found in vintage electrical or mechanical designs. These elements are consistent with steampunk themes, where functional-looking parts are used decoratively. Their placement around the robot enhances the impression of a complex, working machine.",

      "question": "Are there small glowing orbs present as decorative elements in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Scattered around the base of the robot, particularly near the clockwork gadgets and copper coils, are small spherical lights emitting a warm glow. These orbs appear to be illuminated from within, suggesting they are either LED lights or stylized representations of electric bulbs. Their placement among the mechanical elements adds a magical or technological ambiance to the scene. Such glowing elements are often used in steampunk art to simulate energy flow or to enhance visual appeal.",

      "question": "Are intricate steampunk-style patterns etched onto the base of the glass bell jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the glass bell jar, which supports the dome, is made of metal and features detailed engravings. These engravings include interlocking gears, mechanical arms, and other motifs typical of steampunk design. The patterns are not random but follow a structured, symmetrical layout that suggests intentional artistic craftsmanship. The etching is deep enough to cast subtle shadows, enhancing their visibility. This level of detail aligns with the aesthetic of combining industrial machinery with ornate decoration, a hallmark of the steampunk genre.",

      "question": "Does the background display a rusted metal texture that complements the robot’s antique bronze coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background behind the glass bell jar shows a textured surface with patches of orange-brown discoloration, pitting, and flaking—hallmarks of rusted metal. This aged, corroded appearance contrasts with the polished bronze finish of the robot, yet harmonizes with it through shared earthy tones and a sense of antiquity. The rusted backdrop enhances the steampunk theme by reinforcing the idea of old-world technology and decayed industrial environments. The color palette and texture of the background are carefully chosen to complement the robot's metallic hues, creating a cohesive visual narrative.",
