      "question": "Is the cat depicted as part of a collectible figurine box design labeled \"Majestic Window\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a box is clearly visible on the windowsill with the text 'Majestic Window' printed on its front base. Inside the box, there is a stylized cat figure that matches the design aesthetic of a collectible item. The packaging features decorative elements such as floral patterns and a window motif, consistent with collectible figurine branding. The label 'Majestic Window' is legible and positioned prominently, indicating it is part of the product’s name or theme. This aligns with common practices in collectible toy packaging where the name is displayed to identify the series or product line. Therefore, the cat is indeed depicted as part of a collectible figurine box design labeled 'Majestic Window'.",

      "question": "Is the figurine box shown in an isometric view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An isometric view presents a three-dimensional object with equal angles between the axes, typically showing three sides of the object at 120-degree angles. In Image B, the figurine box is angled so that its top, front, and side are visible, but the perspective does not maintain equal scaling or angles typical of true isometric projection. Instead, it appears to be a slightly elevated three-quarter view, commonly used in product photography to showcase depth while maintaining realism. This is not a strict isometric view, which would require parallel projection without foreshortening. Hence, the view is more accurately described as a realistic perspective rather than isometric.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine box in Image B is adorned with intricate floral designs, including pink roses, green leaves, and delicate vines. These patterns are consistently distributed across the top and sides of the box, suggesting a deliberate decorative theme. Such floral motifs are common in collectible packaging aimed at evoking elegance or nostalgia. The presence of these elements is clear and visually prominent, confirming their inclusion as part of the box's design.",

      "question": "Is there a glossy chibi-style cat figure inside the figurine box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the box, a cat figure is visible with exaggerated features such as large eyes and a proportionally small body, characteristic of the chibi art style. The surface of the figure reflects light, indicating a glossy finish, likely made of plastic or resin. This type of material and styling is typical for collectible figurines. The combination of chibi proportions and shiny texture confirms that the figure is both glossy and styled in a chibi manner.",

      "question": "Do the eyes of the chibi cat figure appear sparkling and blue, resembling glass or gemstones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes of the chibi cat figure inside the box are rendered with a bright blue color and contain multiple highlights and reflections, giving them a luminous, almost crystalline appearance. This visual effect mimics the look of glass or gemstones, commonly used in collectible figures to enhance aesthetic appeal. The sparkle is achieved through digital rendering techniques that simulate light refraction, reinforcing the impression of a high-quality, polished surface. Thus, the eyes do resemble glass or gemstones.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To the right of the figurine box, there is a cat figure that appears highly detailed and lifelike in terms of fur texture, facial structure, and posture. Unlike the chibi version inside the box, this one has natural proportions and realistic shading, suggesting it is meant to represent a real cat. It is placed on a wooden surface and interacts with the environment (e.g., shadows and lighting) in a way that suggests physical presence. While it may still be a figurine, its design emphasizes realism over stylization, making it a realistic depiction compared to the chibi version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The realistic cat figure exhibits fine details in its fur, such as individual strands, subtle shading, and soft gradients that mimic real animal fur. The tail, in particular, shows layered textures and depth. Additionally, the wooden windowsill beneath the figure displays visible wood grain, knots, and natural color variations, consistent with real wood surfaces. These details suggest careful rendering to simulate authenticity, enhancing the overall realism of the scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B features soft, directional lighting that creates subtle shadows under the figurine box and the cat figure, enhancing depth and dimensionality. The reflections on the glossy surfaces of the chibi cat and the vase suggest controlled lighting conditions typical of studio photography. The composition is balanced, with attention to background detail (e.g., the blurred landscape outside the window), which adds context without distracting from the main subjects. These elements—realistic lighting, accurate shadows, and thoughtful staging—are hallmarks of professional product showcases designed to highlight items attractively.",
