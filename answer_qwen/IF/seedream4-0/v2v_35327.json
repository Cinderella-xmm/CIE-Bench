      "question": "Does the image exhibit characteristics of surrealism such as dreamlike or unexpected juxtapositions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image features a blue-skinned figure holding a golden, geometrically shaped object that resembles a banana but is clearly abstracted into a polyhedral form. This transformation of a common object (a banana) into an unnatural, crystalline shape is a hallmark of surrealism, which often involves dreamlike or illogical transformations. Additionally, the background contains swirling, fluid-like patterns and celestial bodies floating in a non-Euclidean space, further contributing to a dreamlike atmosphere. The presence of a liquid-like substance dripping from the figure’s neck and shoulders adds to the sense of reality being distorted, a key element in surrealist art. These visual cues—unexpected forms, altered physics, and fantastical elements—are consistent with surrealist principles.",

      "question": "Are there abstract shapes and bold contrasts present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the image prominently features abstract shapes, particularly the golden polyhedral object held by the figure, which lacks the organic curves of a real banana and instead has sharp edges and flat surfaces, resembling a Platonic solid. This geometric abstraction stands in stark contrast to the smooth, flowing lines of the figure's body. Additionally, the background contains swirling, amorphous forms with vivid color contrasts—such as deep blues, fiery reds, and yellows—that create a visually dynamic and intense environment. The contrast between the cool blue tones of the figure and the warm gold of the object also enhances the visual impact. These elements together confirm the presence of both abstract shapes and bold color contrasts.",

      "question": "Is the gold banana depicted as a levitating geometric form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden object in the image is not a traditional banana but a stylized, geometric form resembling a dodecahedron or similar polyhedron. It appears to be floating above the figure’s hand, suggesting levitation. While it is inspired by the shape of a banana, its transformation into a faceted, metallic structure and its suspended position in mid-air align with the concept of a 'levitating geometric form.' The lack of any visible support for the object reinforces the impression of defying gravity, a common trope in surreal and fantastical imagery. Thus, despite not being a literal banana, the object functions symbolically as a levitating geometric representation of one.",

      "question": "Does the blue figure display liquefying textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the blue figure exhibits clear signs of liquefaction. The skin appears to be melting or flowing, especially around the neck and shoulders, where droplets are visibly dripping downward. The texture is glossy and reflective, mimicking the appearance of liquid paint or viscous fluid. This effect creates a sense of instability and transformation, reinforcing the surreal nature of the scene. Such liquefied textures are reminiscent of Salvador Dalí’s melting clocks, a classic example of surrealism where solid objects lose their rigidity. Therefore, the visual evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the figure displays liquefying textures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the image is highly distorted and non-realistic, featuring swirling, marbled patterns in vibrant colors that resemble cosmic nebulae or abstract paint strokes. There are also floating spherical objects that resemble planets or moons, positioned in impossible configurations. The ground appears to be a mix of molten substances and strange formations, adding to the otherworldly feel. These warped and fantastical elements—such as the bending of space, the absence of coherent perspective, and the presence of surreal celestial bodies—create a dreamlike, hallucinatory environment. This kind of visual distortion is characteristic of surrealist and psychedelic art, designed to evoke a sense of wonder and disorientation. Hence, the background does indeed feature warped components that enhance the fantastical atmosphere.",
