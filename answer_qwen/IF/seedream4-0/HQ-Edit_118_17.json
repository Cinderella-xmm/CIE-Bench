      "question": "Is the stave church enclosed within a transparent glass display case with visible structural framing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stave church is clearly positioned inside a large, transparent enclosure. The structure of this enclosure is defined by visible metallic or clear framing at the edges, forming a rectangular prism. This framing is consistent with the design of a glass display case used to protect and showcase artifacts. The transparency allows full visibility of the church while maintaining the integrity of the case's structure. Based on visual cues such as reflections, edge lines, and the way light interacts with the surfaces, it is evident that the church is enclosed in a glass case with structural framing.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there multiple layers of soft, wispy clouds visible in the background panel behind the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Behind the glass display case in Image B, there is a painted or sculpted backdrop depicting a sky scene. This backdrop features several cloud formations that are rendered in a soft, layered style, resembling fluffy cumulus clouds with varying opacity and depth. These clouds appear to be part of a decorative panel rather than real atmospheric elements, suggesting they are designed to enhance the aesthetic of the diorama. The presence of multiple cloud layers adds dimensionality to the background, which is typical in curated display settings to simulate natural environments.",

      "question": "Are small-scale coniferous trees positioned around the base of the glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the base of the glass display case in Image B, there are numerous miniature coniferous trees arranged in a semi-circular pattern. These trees are significantly smaller than the surrounding full-sized pine trees outside the case, indicating they are scale models. Their placement directly around the base of the case suggests they are part of the diorama setup, intended to mimic a forest environment. This detail supports the idea that the entire scene is a carefully constructed model exhibit.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the mountains in the background feature a desaturated, low-contrast color palette consistent with a muted tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mountains visible in the background of Image B have subdued tones, with earthy browns, grays, and pale greens dominating the color scheme. There is minimal contrast between the mountain slopes and the sky, and no bright highlights or sharp shadows, which contributes to a desaturated and muted appearance. This lack of vibrancy is characteristic of a stylized or artistic rendering rather than a high-contrast natural photograph. The overall effect is one of calmness and timelessness, often used in dioramas to avoid distracting from the central subject.",

      "question": "Is there sculpted rocky terrain forming a border around the base of the glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Surrounding the base of the glass display case in Image B, there is a ring of irregularly shaped rocks and boulders. These rocks appear to be sculpted or modeled to resemble natural stone formations and are arranged to form a distinct boundary between the diorama and the surrounding landscape. This element enhances the realism of the scene by simulating a natural transition from the artificial display to the outdoor environment, reinforcing the idea of a curated, miniature world.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a simulated snowy path with faint footprint imprints leading up to the entrance of the stave church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In front of the glass display case, there is a white, textured surface that mimics snow. This surface extends toward the entrance of the stave church and includes subtle indentations that resemble footprints. These impressions are evenly spaced and lead directly to the steps of the church, suggesting a deliberate design choice to evoke a sense of human presence in a winter setting. The snow appears to be part of the dioramaâ€™s ground layer, not actual snow, but its texture and markings are consistent with a simulated snowy path.",

      "question": "Does the stave church retain its original architectural details such as carved wooden elements, multiple gables, and dragon-shaped roof ornaments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stave church within the glass case in Image B maintains all the key architectural features typical of traditional Norwegian stave churches. These include intricate carved wooden panels, multiple steep gabled roofs, and ornate dragon-head finials at the roof peaks. The craftsmanship of these details is preserved, even though the church is now part of a scaled-down model. The level of detail suggests that the model was created with historical accuracy in mind, ensuring that the original design elements are faithfully represented.",
