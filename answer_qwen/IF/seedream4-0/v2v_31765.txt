    "Question": "Q1: Have the vegetables and knife been broken down into geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables (carrots, celery, and onions) and the knife are composed of angular, faceted forms rather than smooth, natural surfaces. Each piece appears to be constructed from polygonal planes, such as cubes, triangles, and irregular polyhedrons, which is characteristic of a geometric breakdown. This style mimics how objects are deconstructed in Cubist art, where forms are reduced to basic geometric elements. The edges are sharp, and shading follows flat planes, indicating intentional abstraction into geometric components. Based on visual cues like these faceted structures and the absence of organic curves, it is clear that the objects have been broken down into geometric shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the geometric shapes rearranged in an abstract manner?",
    "explanation": "The arrangement of the geometric shapes in Image B does not follow natural spatial logic or realistic proportions. For example, the knife’s blade is fragmented into multiple facets that appear to intersect at unnatural angles, and the vegetables are stacked in ways that suggest overlapping planes and distorted depth. The background cutting board also features triangular and trapezoidal sections that do not conform to real-world wood grain or perspective. These distortions and repositioning of elements—such as the onion pieces appearing layered with internal angles—indicate an abstract rearrangement. In contrast to typical still-life composition, this image uses fragmentation and reassembly, aligning with abstract artistic principles.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the vegetables and knife still recognizable despite being abstracted?",
    "explanation": "Despite the geometric abstraction, the core identity of the objects remains discernible. The orange cubes resemble diced carrots, the green curved shapes mimic celery stalks, and the white blocks represent chopped onions—each retaining enough form and color association to be identified. Similarly, the knife's silhouette, though faceted, maintains its elongated blade and handle structure, allowing recognition. While stylized, the essential characteristics (color, shape, and arrangement) are preserved sufficiently for viewers to identify them based on prior knowledge of food preparation scenes. This balance between abstraction and recognizability is common in artistic interpretations that retain symbolic clarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Has the color palette been simplified to align with Cubist style?",
    "explanation": "Cubism often employs a limited, muted color palette to emphasize form over realism. However, Image B retains vibrant colors: bright orange for carrots, vivid green for celery, and stark white for onions. While there is some variation in tone due to shading across facets, the overall palette is rich and saturated, not simplified. Additionally, the background includes bold orange and yellow tones that contrast sharply with the natural wood texture seen in typical Cubist works. Therefore, although the style is geometrically Cubist, the use of vivid, distinct colors contradicts the traditional Cubist tendency toward monochromatic or subdued hues. Thus, the color palette has not been simplified in alignment with classic Cubist style.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the image show overlapping planes and multiple perspectives characteristic of Cubism?",
    "explanation": "Yes, Image B displays hallmark features of Cubism, including overlapping planes and multiple viewpoints. The knife appears to be viewed from both side and top angles simultaneously, with its blade intersecting various facets. The vegetables are layered in a way that suggests depth through non-parallel planes, and the background cutting board is divided into angular segments that imply different perspectives. These elements break the single-point perspective of realism and instead present the objects from multiple angles at once, a defining trait of Cubist art. The interplay of facets and layering creates a sense of dynamic space, consistent with Cubist techniques.",
    "answer": "Yes"
