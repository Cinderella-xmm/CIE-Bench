      "question": "Is the cathedral rendered as a miniature model made of warm-stained wood instead of stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral is clearly depicted with a uniform warm brown tone throughout its structure, consistent with stained wood rather than stone. The texture and grain patterns visible on surfaces such as columns, arches, and spires resemble those of carved wood. Additionally, the material lacks the typical gray or beige hues associated with stone masonry. This visual evidence, combined with the context of the image being a framed, enclosed model, supports the conclusion that it is a wooden miniature. In contrast, Image A shows a full-scale cathedral in natural stone with cool gray tones and realistic weathering, confirming the difference in material representation. The shift from stone to wood in Image B aligns with the artistic choice of rendering the cathedral as a detailed wooden model.",

      "question": "Is the wooden cathedral model enclosed within an ornate shadow box with visible framing and a transparent front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cathedral model surrounded by a thick, intricately carved wooden frame with decorative floral and scroll motifs, characteristic of an ornate shadow box. The edges of the frame are prominent, and the entire scene appears to be viewed through a glass or transparent surface, indicated by subtle reflections and depth cues. The background behind the model includes elements like a clock mechanism, suggesting the interior of a display case. This setup is consistent with a shadow box designed for showcasing intricate models. In comparison, Image A presents the cathedral in an open outdoor environment without any framing or enclosure, reinforcing the idea that Image B is intentionally presented as a contained, curated object. The presence of the frame and implied glass front confirms the shadow box format.",

      "question": "Are the Gothic architectural details, including pointed arches, flying buttresses, and rose window tracery, visibly detailed and accurately represented in miniature form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model in Image B displays highly intricate Gothic features. Pointed arches are clearly visible at the entrances and along the arcade levels. The rose window is elaborately carved with symmetrical tracery, mimicking real stained-glass designs. Flying buttresses are present on the sides, though slightly simplified due to scale, they retain their structural form. The vertical pinnacles, ribbed vaulting, and sculptural elements around the portals are also finely rendered. These details match known Gothic architectural principles and are proportionally accurate for a miniature. Comparing with Image A, which shows a full-scale cathedral with identical architectural features, confirms that the model replicates these elements faithfully, albeit in a smaller, wooden form. The craftsmanship suggests careful attention to historical accuracy.",

      "question": "Is the entire cathedral model colored in warm stained wood tones, avoiding stone-gray or cold metallic hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette of the model in Image B is consistently warm, ranging from amber to deep reddish-brown, typical of polished or stained hardwood. There are no areas showing gray, beige, or metallic finishes that would suggest stone or metal materials. Even the internal elements like pews and chandeliers share this warm tone, maintaining visual harmony. The lighting enhances the richness of the wood, emphasizing its natural grain. In contrast, Image A features the cathedral in natural stone colors—cool grays and whites—with some dark roofing elements, which differ significantly from the warm tones in Image B. This stark contrast confirms that the model has been deliberately rendered in wood tones, avoiding any stone-like appearance.",

      "question": "Are there miniature pews and chandeliers visible inside the model cathedral?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the model cathedral in Image B, rows of small, evenly spaced benches (pews) are clearly visible on both sides of the central aisle. These pews are crafted in the same warm wood tone as the rest of the structure and are proportionally scaled to fit the miniature space. Additionally, two ornate chandeliers hang from the ceiling—one on each side of the nave—illuminating the interior with soft light. Their design includes multiple candle-like lights and intricate metalwork, consistent with traditional church fixtures. These elements are not present in Image A, which shows an exterior view without any interior furnishings. The inclusion of pews and chandeliers in Image B adds realism and functional detail to the model, enhancing its authenticity as a religious building replica.",

      "question": "Is there a visible clock mechanism located at the back of the model, with small figures positioned along a path suggesting movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the rear right of the model in Image B, a mechanical clock face is visible, complete with Roman numerals and hands indicating time. Behind it, gears and pendulum components are partially exposed, confirming the presence of a clock mechanism. Along a central pathway leading toward the altar, several tiny human figures are arranged in a line, appearing to move forward. Their positioning and spacing suggest sequential motion, possibly part of a clock-driven diorama. This feature is absent in Image A, which depicts a static, real-world cathedral without any mechanical or animated elements. The integration of a clock and moving figures indicates that the model serves both as an architectural representation and a kinetic art piece, likely functioning as a complex cuckoo clock or automaton.",

      "question": "Do the small figures along the clock’s path depict actions related to religious devotion, such as kneeling, praying, or processions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The small figures along the path in Image B are standing upright and walking in a linear procession toward the altar. While they are dressed in period-appropriate attire, none of them are shown kneeling, bowing, or engaged in prayerful gestures. Their posture and alignment suggest a ceremonial or liturgical procession rather than individual acts of devotion. However, the overall context—the setting within a cathedral model and their direction toward the altar—implies a religious purpose. The figures do not exhibit specific devotional poses like hands clasped in prayer or heads bowed. Therefore, while the scene may represent a religious event, the individual actions are more aligned with movement in a procession than direct acts of personal worship. This interpretation is based on visual observation and cultural understanding of religious processions versus private devotion.",
