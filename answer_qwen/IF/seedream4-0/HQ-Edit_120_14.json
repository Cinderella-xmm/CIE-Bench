      "question": "Has the overall form of the bicycle been transformed into a creature-like structure resembling a steampunk insect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is no longer a conventional bicycle. Instead, it features a mechanical body with articulated legs, a segmented exoskeleton-like shell, and wing-like structures on top. These elements are characteristic of steampunk design, which blends Victorian-era aesthetics with mechanical and industrial motifs. The presence of gears, copper tones, and clockwork components further reinforces the steampunk theme. The overall silhouette resembles that of an insect, particularly a beetle, due to its six-legged stance, domed back, and elongated neck-like structure ending in wings. This transformation from a functional bicycle to a fantastical, biomechanical creature indicates a complete reimagining of the original form.",

      "question": "Are the frame components replaced with an exoskeleton structure featuring visible cogwheel joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frame of the original bicycle has been entirely reworked into a mechanical exoskeleton. In Image B, the central body of the structure is composed of a large, curved metallic shell resembling an insect’s carapace, with multiple exposed gears and cogs integrated into its surface. The limbs—especially the legs—are constructed from jointed metal rods connected by gear-like hinges, mimicking biological articulation. These joints are clearly visible and function as mechanical pivot points, consistent with a steampunk-inspired exoskeleton. The use of brass and copper materials enhances the industrial aesthetic, and the visible gearing suggests a complex internal mechanism. This contrasts sharply with the smooth, continuous tubing of a traditional bicycle frame.",

      "question": "Has the bicycle seat been transformed into a detailed, ornate carapace resembling an insect's back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area corresponding to the bicycle seat in a traditional bike is now part of a large, domed, metallic structure that serves as the main body of the creature. This structure is highly detailed, featuring embossed patterns, rivets, and embedded gears, giving it the appearance of an insect’s hard outer shell or carapace. Its shape is rounded and segmented, typical of beetle backs, and it is positioned centrally, just like a seat would be on a bicycle. The material appears to be polished copper or bronze, contributing to the steampunk aesthetic. This transformation aligns with the overall theme of converting bicycle parts into insectoid anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have both wheels been replaced with hinged, mechanical leg structures instead of traditional circular wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two circular wheels of the original bicycle have been completely removed and replaced with six mechanical legs. These legs are articulated, jointed, and made of metal rods connected by hinge mechanisms and gears. They extend from the underside of the main body, forming a tripod-like stance typical of insects. The front pair of legs is slightly raised, suggesting mobility or balance. There are no traces of circular wheels; instead, the entire lower structure functions as a walking apparatus. This change reflects a shift from a vehicle designed for rolling motion to a creature capable of locomotion through leg movement, consistent with a steampunk insect concept.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there copper-colored, wing-like extensions attached along the top bar of the bicycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper portion of the structure features two large, flat, copper-colored extensions that resemble insect wings. These wings are attached to a central vertical rod that extends upward from the body, replacing what would be the handlebars of a bicycle. The wings have a veined texture, mimicking natural insect wings, and are angled outward as if ready for flight. The material is consistent with copper or brass, fitting the steampunk theme. These wing-like structures are clearly derived from the bicycle's top tube and handlebar area, now repurposed into a dramatic, functional-looking appendage.",

      "question": "Are there antique-style clock faces with mysterious runes displayed at the handlebar area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, where the handlebars of the original bicycle would be located, there are three small, round clock faces mounted along a vertical rod. These clocks have Roman numerals and hands, giving them an antique appearance. However, upon closer inspection, the symbols on the clock faces do not appear to be standard Roman numerals but rather stylized or fictional runes, adding to the mystical or steampunk fantasy element. These clocks are positioned symmetrically and serve as decorative or functional elements of the creature’s head or sensory apparatus. Their placement and design suggest they are part of the creature’s mechanical 'nervous system' or timekeeping mechanism, reinforcing the steampunk narrative.",
