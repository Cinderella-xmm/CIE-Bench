      "question": "Does the edited image display a visual texture consistent with satin paper, including a soft sheen and slight reflectivity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the portrait in Image B appears to be on a white paper-like medium, but it does not exhibit the characteristic soft sheen or reflective quality typical of satin paper. Instead, the texture seems more matte, consistent with watercolor paper, which absorbs pigment and lacks gloss. Satin paper usually has a smooth, slightly shiny finish that reflects light subtly, but this is not observed here. The lighting in the image shows no specular highlights or reflections that would suggest a satin surface. Therefore, based on visual cues and knowledge of paper textures, the surface is not consistent with satin paper.",

      "question": "Is the suit rendered with visible watercolor effects, showing blended blue-black hues and soft, painterly edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit jacket exhibits clear signs of watercolor rendering. The blue tones are blended with darker areas (suggesting black or deep navy), creating gradients and soft transitions between colors. The edges of the suit are not sharply defined but instead have feathered, diffused boundaries typical of watercolor techniques. Additionally, there are visible washes and variations in saturation, especially around the lapel and shoulder areas, which reinforce the impression of water-based paint application. These characteristics align with traditional watercolor aesthetics, where pigments bleed into each other and create organic forms.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible golden pinstripes running vertically along the suit jacket, consistent with the watercolor aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the suit jacket in Image B, thin vertical lines resembling pinstripes are indeed present. These lines are rendered in a golden-yellow hue, contrasting against the blue-black watercolor base of the jacket. The lines appear intentionally placed and follow the contours of the jacket, suggesting they are part of the artistic design. Importantly, these stripes maintain the fluidity and slight irregularity expected in watercolor art—some are fainter than others, and their edges blend softly into the surrounding paint. This suggests they were painted rather than digitally added, fitting within the overall watercolor style.",

      "question": "Are there at least two different tie patterns visible across the images in the series?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A (the original photo), the tie is solid red with small white polka dots—a simple, repeating pattern. In Image B (the edited version), the tie features a complex, abstract design incorporating multiple colors such as red, blue, and white, arranged in a mosaic-like or fragmented pattern, possibly representing architectural elements or cityscapes. This is clearly different from the polka-dot pattern in Image A. Since both images show distinct tie designs—one geometrically simple, the other artistically abstract—the series includes at least two different tie patterns. The transformation from one to the other indicates intentional stylistic change, confirming diversity in pattern representation.",

      "question": "Is the image presented within a leather-bound album frame featuring an embossed title, with visible texture and depth suggesting real leather and raised lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the portrait placed inside a dark brown, textured cover that resembles genuine leather. The surface has a grainy appearance consistent with leather material, and the edges are stitched, further supporting the authenticity of the binding. On the cover, the word 'KOLLEKTION' is embossed in gold lettering, with decorative flourishes above and below. The letters appear raised, casting subtle shadows, indicating physical depth and three-dimensionality. This detail, combined with the realistic texture of the material and the craftsmanship of the binding, strongly suggests a high-quality, leather-bound album. The presentation evokes a sense of permanence and collectibility, reinforcing the idea of a curated artistic piece.",

      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit rich textures (such as satin, leather, or watercolor brushwork) and a refined, timeless composition that conveys classic elegance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image combines multiple rich textures: the watercolor brushwork on the portrait itself, with its soft blending and expressive strokes; the textured leather cover of the album, complete with stitching and embossing; and the tactile appearance of the paper beneath the painting. These elements together create a layered sensory experience. The composition is carefully balanced, with the portrait centered and framed by the luxurious album, giving it a formal, archival quality. The use of classical materials (leather, gold lettering) and artistic technique (watercolor) enhances the timeless appeal. The overall effect is one of sophistication and enduring value, aligning with the notion of classic elegance.",
