    "Question": "Q1: Is the edited image composed of three distinct panels arranged side by side?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the visual structure clearly shows three separate rectangular sections joined together with hinges, forming a tri-fold layout. Each panel contains a distinct illustration of a gymnast on a balance beam, and the frames are aligned horizontally in a continuous row. This configuration is consistent with a triptych-style presentation, commonly used for decorative or artistic displays. The presence of visible hinges between the panels confirms that they are designed to fold together, which supports the conclusion that this is a three-panel composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the gymnasts depicted in a semi-realistic cartoon style, with stylized features but retaining human proportions?",
    "explanation": "The gymnasts in Image B exhibit characteristics typical of a semi-realistic cartoon style. Their features—such as facial expressions, hair, and body shapes—are simplified and exaggerated compared to real-life figures (e.g., larger eyes, smoother skin, idealized forms), which aligns with cartoon aesthetics. However, their body proportions remain anatomically plausible: limbs are balanced, joints are correctly positioned, and overall scale is consistent with human anatomy. This blend of stylization and realism indicates a semi-realistic approach rather than a fully abstract or hyper-realistic one.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the gymnasts' outfits feature flowy designs that suggest movement, such as draping or trailing fabric?",
    "explanation": "Each gymnast in Image B wears a leotard with an attached skirt-like extension made of flowing material. These extensions appear to be billowing outward, especially noticeable in the left and right panels where the fabric trails behind the athletes’ legs and arms, creating dynamic arcs that imply motion. The texture and layering of the fabric suggest it is lightweight and designed to enhance the sense of movement during performance. Such elements are characteristic of artistic gymnastics costumes meant to accentuate grace and fluidity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Are the dominant colors in the image earthy tones such as browns, greens, and warm neutrals?",
    "explanation": "The color palette of Image B centers around rich brown hues in the frame and the gymnasts’ attire, particularly the deep brown leotard in the central panel and the lighter brown accents in the others. There are also touches of olive green and beige, especially in the rightmost panel’s outfit and background. These colors fall within the range of earthy tones—warm, natural shades derived from soil, wood, and foliage. While there are some white and light blue elements (like socks and the balance beam), they serve as neutral complements rather than dominant forces. Thus, the overall impression is dominated by warm, grounded tones.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there visible sequined or sparkly patterns on the gymnasts’ outfits that stand out due to texture or reflection?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnasts’ leotards display small, circular highlights along the chest and sleeves that resemble sequins or glitter. These reflective spots catch the light and create a shimmering effect, suggesting embellishments intended to sparkle under illumination. This detail is particularly evident in the central figure's outfit, where the pattern follows the contours of the bodice. Such decorative elements are common in competitive gymnastics wear and are designed to add visual flair. The depiction of these textures implies intentional design choices to simulate sparkle.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the artwork presented inside a dark walnut-colored tri-fold frame suitable for tabletop display?",
    "explanation": "The frame in Image B is constructed from dark wood with a finish resembling walnut, characterized by its deep brown tone and visible grain patterns. It has a tri-fold design with two hinges connecting the three panels, allowing them to be folded flat or displayed open. The size and shape of the frame suggest it is compact enough to rest securely on a flat surface like a table or shelf, making it appropriate for tabletop display. Additionally, the absence of hanging hardware further supports its intended use as a freestanding piece rather than wall-mounted art.",
    "answer": "Yes"
