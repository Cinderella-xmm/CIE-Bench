      "question": "Are the surfers replaced with pandas holding surfboards?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures that were originally humans in Image A are now clearly depicted as pandas. These pandas are standing upright on the beach, each holding a surfboard. The visual features such as black and white fur, distinct facial markings, and bear-like body structure confirm they are pandas. Their posture mimics that of the original surfers, but their species has been changed entirely. This transformation is consistent with a digital edit where human figures are replaced with anthropomorphized animals while maintaining the overall scene composition.",

      "question": "Is the sunset and beach setting kept intact without any changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B shows a sunset over the ocean with warm hues of orange and yellow, similar to Image A. The horizon line, waves, sand texture, and lighting conditions (such as reflections on the wet sand) appear identical. There are no visible alterations to the sky, sea, or beach environment. The continuity of the natural elements suggests that only the foreground subjects (the surfers) were modified, while the environmental backdrop remained unchanged. This indicates that the setting was preserved exactly as it was in the original image.",

      "question": "Are the pandas positioned similarly to the original surfers, facing the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the two surfers are standing side by side, facing away from the camera toward the sunset. In Image B, the pandas are also positioned side by side, facing the same direction—toward the sunset. Their orientation matches that of the original figures, maintaining the same spatial relationship to the sun and the ocean. Although their heads are turned slightly more toward the viewer than the humans were, their overall stance and alignment suggest an intentional preservation of the original composition. This positioning ensures visual continuity between the two images.",

      "question": "Are the pandas holding surfboards in their paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both pandas are seen gripping surfboards with their front paws. The left panda holds a yellow surfboard with its right paw, and the right panda holds a multicolored surfboard with its left paw. The way the paws wrap around the boards resembles how hands would hold them, indicating an anthropomorphic adaptation. While real pandas do not typically hold objects this way, the depiction here uses realistic animal anatomy combined with human-like behavior for artistic effect. The grip is consistent with the action of carrying a surfboard, which aligns with the context of surfing.",

      "question": "Do the surfboards retain their original colors and design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the surfboards have not changed in color or design. The left surfboard remains solid yellow with black fins at the bottom, and the right surfboard retains its vertical stripes of red, orange, and teal with black fins. The shape, size, and placement of the surfboards are identical in both images. This consistency suggests that only the figures were altered, while all other elements—including the surfboards—were preserved exactly as they appeared in the original photo. Therefore, the surfboards maintain their original appearance.",
