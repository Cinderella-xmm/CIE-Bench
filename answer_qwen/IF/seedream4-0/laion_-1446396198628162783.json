      "question": "Is the title \"Journey to Space\" clearly displayed in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'Journey to Space' is prominently positioned at the top center of the image. The text is large, white, and set against a dark background, which ensures high contrast and readability. The font is bold and sans-serif, commonly used in modern graphic design for clarity and impact. This placement and styling make the title immediately noticeable and clearly legible. Based on visual cues such as size, color contrast, and positioning, it is evident that the title is intended to be the focal point of the header.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the astronaut figure still present and positioned centrally in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The astronaut figure remains visible in Image B, standing in profile view facing right. Although the background has changed significantly, the astronaut's position is largely unchanged relative to the original image. It is centered horizontally within the frame, maintaining visual balance with the surrounding elements. The figure appears slightly cropped on the left side due to the addition of graphical overlays, but it is still clearly central and dominant in composition. This positioning suggests that the astronaut continues to serve as the primary subject, anchoring the viewer’s attention.",

      "question": "Has the background been transformed into a mission control center with elements like control panels, screens, or consoles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the astronaut has been digitally altered to depict a high-tech mission control room. There are multiple large monitors displaying blue-themed data visualizations, typical of space mission operations. Below these screens, there are rows of control panels with illuminated buttons and digital readouts, resembling real-life NASA mission control environments. These elements are consistent with the aesthetics of a modern space operations center. The transformation from the cluttered workshop in Image A to this futuristic setting indicates a deliberate thematic shift toward space mission simulation and preparation.",

      "question": "Are there four distinct illustrative icons present, each representing one of the following: Physical Training, Technical Skills, Simulators, and Space Suit Check?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes four square-shaped icons arranged horizontally across the lower portion of the image. Each icon contains a stylized white line drawing representing a specific training component: a calendar for 'Physical Training', an astronaut reading for 'Technical Skills', an astronaut in a simulator for 'Simulators', and an astronaut inspecting a suit for 'Space Suit Check'. These icons are clearly labeled with their respective titles beneath them. The visual representation aligns perfectly with the described training stages, and the symbolic content matches the intended meaning of each category.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the four training stages represented in distinct, vibrant color-coded sections (e.g., different colored backgrounds or labels)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each of the four training stage icons in Image B is set against a uniquely colored background: blue for 'Physical Training', green for 'Technical Skills', orange for 'Simulators', and purple for 'Space Suit Check'. These colors are bright and distinct, providing strong visual separation between the categories. The use of contrasting colors enhances readability and helps organize information hierarchically. This color-coding strategy is common in infographics to aid comprehension and memory retention, indicating a deliberate design choice for clarity and visual appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the text describing each training stage written in clean, modern typography (e.g., sans-serif font, consistent style)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The descriptive text under each icon uses a clean, sans-serif typeface, which is characteristic of modern digital design. The font is consistent across all four sections, with uniform spacing and alignment. While the text appears slightly blurred or distorted—possibly due to intentional stylistic effects or compression—it maintains a readable structure. The overall typographic style is minimalist and professional, aligning with contemporary infographic standards. Despite minor visual artifacts, the intent to use a modern, legible font is clear.",

      "question": "Does the overall design appear cohesive and informative, with a logical flow connecting the astronaut to the training stages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of Image B integrates the astronaut figure with the surrounding informational elements in a way that creates a coherent narrative. The astronaut, positioned centrally, acts as a visual anchor, while the four training modules are arranged symmetrically around the lower half of the image. The color-coded icons and accompanying text guide the viewer through a structured journey from preparation to execution. The title 'Journey to Space' reinforces the theme, and the mission control background adds contextual depth. The layout follows a logical progression: from physical and technical readiness to simulation and final checks. This organized structure, combined with consistent visual language, makes the design both aesthetically pleasing and functionally informative.",
