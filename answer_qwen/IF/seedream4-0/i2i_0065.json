      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B indicate that the dog's head is displayed within a glass case, which is typical of museum exhibits. The background shows a well-lit indoor environment with other display cases and informational panels visible, consistent with a museum setting. Additionally, the presence of a descriptive label on a stand beneath the object further supports the interpretation that this is part of a curated exhibit. These elements—glass enclosure, lighting, informational signage, and surrounding displays—are all characteristic features of a museum exhibit corner.",

      "question": "Is the dog shown inside a glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's head is clearly enclosed within a transparent glass structure with visible edges and reflections, indicating it is housed in a display case. The reflection of overhead lights on the glass surface and the way the object is isolated from the surrounding environment confirm that it is protected behind glass, as commonly seen in museum or gallery settings. This setup is designed to preserve and showcase artifacts or specimens, which aligns with the use of a glass case.",

      "question": "Is the light focused on the dog's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears to be directed specifically toward the dog's head, creating highlights on its nose, forehead, and eyes. The illumination enhances facial features such as the texture of the fur and the contours of the muzzle, while the surrounding area remains relatively dimmer. This selective lighting technique is often used in museums to draw attention to the central subject, suggesting that the light is indeed focused on the dog's face.",

      "question": "Is there a label present that describes the breed and includes a story title?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A white rectangular label is visible in front of the dog’s bust in Image B. The text on the label reads 'American Staffordshire Terrier' followed by 'Loyal Companion: The Story of a Beloved Breed.' This indicates both the breed identification and a narrative title, which matches the description provided in the question. Such labels are standard in museum exhibits to inform viewers about the displayed item.",

      "question": "Does the dog maintain its original posture and appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a sculpted or taxidermied representation of a dog's head rather than a live animal. While the breed characteristics (e.g., black and white coat, facial markings) resemble those of the dog in Image A, the form is static and artificial. In contrast, Image A shows a live dog lying down with natural posture and soft features. The edited version in Image B has been transformed into a museum artifact with exaggerated anatomical details and rigid positioning, meaning it no longer maintains the original living posture or dynamic appearance. Therefore, despite similarities in breed traits, the overall posture and authenticity of the appearance have changed significantly.",
