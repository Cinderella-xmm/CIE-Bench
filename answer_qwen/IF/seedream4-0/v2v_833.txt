    "Question": "Q1: Is the character rendered in a 3D cartoon style with soft lighting and a vibrant personality?",
    "explanation": "The character in Image B exhibits features typical of 3D cartoon rendering, such as exaggerated facial proportions (large eyes, rounded cheeks), smooth skin texture, and stylized hair. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating gentle shadows that enhance the three-dimensional appearance without harsh contrasts. The expression is cheerful and inviting, contributing to a vibrant and approachable personality. These visual cues align with common characteristics of modern 3D animated characters found in games or digital media. This contrasts with traditional realistic painting styles, which are more subdued and naturalistic.",
