      "question": "Has the tree trunk been reshaped into distinct arm and leg forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original tree trunk from Image A has been transformed into two anthropomorphic figures. These figures have clearly defined limbs—arms and legs—that are stylized and cartoonish. The trunk is no longer a static structure but has been reimagined as part of animated characters. This transformation involves replacing the natural form of the tree with human-like features, including arms extending outward and legs positioned as if walking or standing. This indicates a significant departure from the original tree design, where such limbs did not exist. Based on visual cues and common understanding of character design in illustrations, the tree trunk has indeed been reshaped into distinct arm and leg forms.",

      "question": "Are there leaf-shaped elements positioned as heads with cartoonish facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both characters have heads composed entirely of leaf-shaped elements arranged in a circular fashion, resembling foliage. These leaf clusters serve as the head area for each figure. Furthermore, each 'leaf head' includes cartoonish facial features such as eyes, mouths, and cheeks, which are typical in anthropomorphic designs. This aligns with common artistic techniques used in creating friendly, seasonal characters (e.g., scarecrows or autumn-themed mascots). In contrast to Image A, where leaves are simply attached to branches without faces, Image B introduces expressive, personified heads made from leaves. Thus, the presence of leaf-shaped elements functioning as heads with facial features is evident.",

      "question": "Do the leaf faces display visible cartoonish facial expressions (e.g., eyes, mouth, eyebrows)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, both characters exhibit clear cartoonish facial features. Each has large, round eyes with pupils, rosy cheeks, and smiling mouths. One character also displays closed eyes with curved lines indicating joy, while the other shows open eyes and an open-mouthed smile. These elements are standard in animation and children's illustration to convey emotion. There are no eyebrows, but the overall expression is unmistakably cheerful and exaggerated in style. Compared to Image A, which lacks any facial features entirely, this addition represents a major stylistic shift toward anthropomorphism. Therefore, the leaf faces do display visible cartoonish facial expressions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both characters wear hats that resemble traditional Pilgrim-style hats, complete with buckles and brims. Additionally, one character wears a striped orange and red scarf around its neck. These accessories are consistent with Thanksgiving-themed attire and add to the festive, seasonal atmosphere. The use of such clothing items is common in holiday illustrations to evoke cultural references (e.g., Pilgrims) and enhance character identity. In contrast, Image A contains no such accessories—only a bare tree trunk and leaves. Hence, the presence of hats and scarves is a new element introduced in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes multiple speech bubbles surrounding the two characters. These bubbles contain variations of 'Happy Thanksgiving,' some with intentional misspellings like 'Thankgving' or 'Tinougving,' possibly for humorous effect. Other bubbles include phrases like 'Fordue' and 'Ricnbuet Thanvinaa!' which appear to be playful distortions of words. Speech bubbles are a common feature in cartoons to convey dialogue or thoughts. In Image A, there are no text bubbles—only the static text 'Happy Thanksgiving' below the image. Therefore, the addition of these dynamic text elements is a notable change in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B is framed by a rectangular border, similar in style to the one in Image A. All elements—the two anthropomorphic characters, their hats and scarves, and all speech bubbles—are positioned inside this border. Even though the speech bubbles extend close to the edges, they remain within the boundary lines. The layout maintains consistency with the original framing, suggesting that the designer preserved the structural integrity of the card’s format. Comparing it to Image A, where the tree and text are similarly bounded, the same spatial constraint applies here. Thus, the entire composition stays within the original border.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color scheme in Image B prominently features warm tones associated with autumn: various shades of orange, yellow, red, and brown. The leaves, hats, scarves, and even the skin tones of the characters reflect this palette. For example, the leaves range from golden yellow to deep orange, and the trunks and clothing use rich browns and rust hues. This color choice aligns with typical representations of fall and Thanksgiving themes. In Image A, the same autumnal colors are used for the leaves and tree trunk, so the continuity of the palette is maintained. Therefore, all colors in Image B are consistent with the autumn palette.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of Image B, the phrase 'Happy Thanksgiving' is clearly displayed in a bold, serif font, centered beneath the main illustration. This matches the placement and content of the text in Image A, where the same message appears below the tree. While the style may vary slightly (e.g., font weight or spacing), the core message remains unchanged and fully visible. The retention of this text ensures thematic continuity between the two images, reinforcing the holiday greeting despite the dramatic visual transformation above. Therefore, the text is indeed still visible.",
