      "question": "Has the backpack's fabric been replaced with a visible rugged leather texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack exhibits a rich, brown material with a distinct grainy surface and natural creases typical of genuine or faux leather. Unlike the smooth, matte appearance of canvas seen in many standard backpacks, this material shows depth, texture, and variations in tone that are characteristic of leather. The visual cues such as the way light reflects off the surface, the presence of subtle folds, and the overall tactile impression suggest a rugged leather texture rather than fabric. This is further supported by world knowledge that leather backpacks often have a more durable, weathered look compared to fabric ones, which aligns with the aesthetic here.",

      "question": "Have the buckles been updated to feature an antique brass finish instead of the original metallic silver color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the buckles on the front flap of the backpack in Image B, they appear to have a warm, golden-brown hue with a slightly aged or patinated surface, consistent with an antique brass finish. This contrasts sharply with the bright, reflective silver tone typically seen in modern metal hardware. The coloration and subtle tarnishing effect suggest intentional aging for a vintage look. Comparing this to common design trends, antique brass is frequently used in retro or vintage-themed products to enhance authenticity. Therefore, based on visual evidence and design conventions, the buckles have indeed been updated to an antique brass finish.",

      "question": "Are there visible vintage-style travel patches attached along the side panels of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the right side panel of the backpack in Image B, there is a clearly visible patch featuring what appears to be a map-like illustration with decorative borders, resembling a vintage travel badge. Another similar patch is partially visible on the left side. These patches include stylized designs, such as compasses and flags, commonly associated with old-world exploration themes. Such elements are typical of 'traveler' or 'adventure' branding and are often applied as decorative accents on vintage-inspired gear. Their placement and design strongly suggest they are intentional vintage-style travel patches.",

      "question": "Is the text \"EXPLORE VINTAGE\" clearly visible and overlaid on the front flap of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The front flap of the backpack in Image B prominently displays the words 'EXPLORE VINTAGE' in raised, embossed lettering with a contrasting lighter color against the darker leather background. The font style is bold and ornate, matching the overall vintage aesthetic. The text is centered and positioned above the main buckle straps, making it highly visible and legible. This kind of branding is common in themed merchandise to emphasize identity and style. Given its clear visibility and integration into the design, it can be confidently stated that the text is present and clearly displayed.",

      "question": "Is there a subtle sketch-style compass graphic embossed near the bottom of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Near the lower center of the backpack in Image B, there is a circular design that resembles a compass rose, rendered in a fine-line, sketch-like style. It features directional points (N, S, E, W) and radiating lines, all subtly etched into the leather surface. The depth and detail suggest it is embossed rather than printed, giving it a tactile quality. This type of graphic is commonly used in adventure or explorer-themed accessories to evoke a sense of navigation and discovery. Based on both visual inspection and contextual design patterns, this compass graphic is indeed present and matches the description.",
