      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infant is wearing a red long-sleeved shirt with a pointed collar and visible buttons on the cuffs. The shirt has a structured appearance, typical of formal or dress shirts. Additionally, the presence of white cufflinks or cuff details (visible at the sleeve ends) further suggests a formal design. In real-world fashion, such features are characteristic of formal attire for adults, and their inclusion in a child's outfit implies an intentional mimicry of adult formal wear. This aligns with common practices in themed baby photography where infants are dressed in miniature versions of adult clothing. Therefore, based on visual cues and world knowledge about formal clothing, the shirt can be classified as formal.",

      "question": "Is the infant wearing a tie?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infant has a striped necktie tied around the collar of the red shirt. The tie features diagonal stripes in colors that match the shirt (red and dark blue), indicating a coordinated ensemble. The knot appears to be a standard Windsor or half-Windsor knot, which is typical for formal ties. Ties are a classic component of formal attire, especially when paired with dress shirts. Given that the tie is properly positioned and styled, it is clear that the infant is wearing a tie. This observation is consistent with both visual evidence and general knowledge about formal clothing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infant is wearing gray trousers with fine vertical pinstripes. Pinstripe patterns are commonly associated with formal or business attire, particularly in suits and dress pants. The cut of the trousers appears tailored, with a straight leg and proper fit, resembling adult formal pants adapted for a small body. While the size is scaled down, the design elements—such as the pinstripes and structured fabric—are indicative of formal wear. Based on these visual cues and knowledge of fashion conventions, the trousers qualify as formal.",

      "question": "Does the infant have glasses as an accessory?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infant is holding a pair of black-rimmed eyeglasses in both hands. The glasses are not worn over the eyes but are being held in front of the chest. Despite not being worn, they are clearly present and appear to be part of the overall styling. The frames are round and thick, reminiscent of classic or vintage eyewear styles often used in playful or thematic photo shoots. Since the glasses are included in the scene and are clearly visible, they function as an accessory in this context. Therefore, the answer is affirmative.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infant is dressed in a red formal shirt, a matching striped tie, pinstripe trousers, and is accessorized with glasses. Each element—shirt, tie, pants, and glasses—is consistent with adult formal wear, albeit scaled down. The coordination of colors (red and dark blue) and patterns (stripes) creates a unified look. While the proportions are adjusted for a baby’s size, the styling mimics adult formal attire closely. In terms of visual cohesion and thematic intent, the outfit is designed to resemble a miniature version of a professional or business-like ensemble. Thus, while not literally suitable for adults due to size, the outfit maintains a cohesive formal appearance that mirrors adult formal wear in style and composition.",
