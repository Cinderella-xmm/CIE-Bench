      "question": "Are there exactly five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon visual inspection of Image B, there are six distinct nesting dolls arranged in descending order of size on a wooden table. Each doll is uniquely sized and nested within the larger one, which is typical for traditional Russian matryoshka dolls. The count includes all visible dolls from the largest to the smallest. Therefore, the number of dolls is six, not five. This conclusion is based on direct observation and counting of each individual doll.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls exhibit a vibrant lime-green color and texture similar to the shoe and tennis ball in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are uniformly painted in a vibrant lime-green color with floral patterns and smooth surfaces. This color matches closely with the lime-green hue seen in the soccer cleat and tennis ball in Image A. While the texture of the dolls appears smooth and painted (likely ceramic or wood), it does not have the same fibrous texture as the tennis ball or the synthetic leather-like texture of the shoe. However, the dominant color is consistent across both images. The similarity in color suggests a thematic or stylistic connection between the two images, even if the textures differ. Based on visual comparison, the color match is strong, though the texture differs slightly.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls organized from largest to smallest in size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are clearly arranged in a row from left to right, with each successive doll being smaller than the previous one. This arrangement follows the traditional presentation of matryoshka dolls, where they are displayed in decreasing size order to emphasize their nesting nature. The progression is consistent and orderly, indicating intentional placement from largest to smallest. This is a common display practice for such items, especially in curated settings like exhibitions or decorative arrangements.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls positioned on a sophisticated wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the nesting dolls placed on a polished wooden table with ornate carvings and curved legs, characteristic of classical or antique furniture design. The rich brown finish, reflective surface, and decorative details suggest a high-quality, possibly vintage or handcrafted piece. These features align with the definition of a 'sophisticated' wooden table, implying elegance and craftsmanship. Therefore, the table supports the aesthetic appeal of the dolls and enhances the overall composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a plain, neutral beige or light gray tone that provides no visual distractions. It lacks patterns, textures, or objects that might draw attention away from the main subject—the nesting dolls. This choice of background is typical in product photography or still-life compositions, where the goal is to highlight the subject without interference. The soft lighting and uniform backdrop ensure that focus remains on the dolls and the table, making the background effectively subtle and non-distracting.",

      "question": "Does the image maintain a 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the aspect ratio, we assess the dimensions of Image B. The width appears to be approximately 1.5 times the height, which corresponds to a 3:2 ratio—a standard format commonly used in photography and digital displays. This can be inferred by observing the proportional relationship between the frame's width and height, where the horizontal expanse comfortably accommodates the full length of the table and the arrangement of dolls without cropping. Additionally, this aspect ratio is typical for high-resolution still images, especially those intended for print or web display. There is no indication of distortion or unconventional framing that would suggest a different ratio.",
