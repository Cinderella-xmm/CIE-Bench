      "question": "Does the van feature a vibrant teal and white two-tone paint job?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The van in Image B clearly displays a two-tone color scheme. The lower portion of the vehicle is painted in a bright, vibrant teal, while the upper section, including the roof and part of the hood, is white. This combination is visually distinct and matches the description of a 'vibrant teal and white two-tone paint job.' The contrast between the colors is strong, and the division line runs horizontally along the side of the van, which is typical of classic two-tone designs. Based on visual inspection and common automotive design terminology, this confirms the presence of such a paint job.",

      "question": "Are there shiny chrome accents on the grille and wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the front of the van in Image B, the grille features a prominent chrome trim around its edges, with a polished finish that reflects light, indicating it is made of chrome or a chrome-like material. Additionally, the hubcaps on the wheels are highly reflective and have a circular, multi-spoke design typical of chrome finishes from vintage vehicles. These elements are consistent with the aesthetic of shiny chrome accents commonly found on classic vans from the 1970s. Therefore, both the grille and wheels exhibit shiny chrome details.",

      "question": "Is there a roof rack loaded with colorful surfboards on top of the van?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The roof of the van in Image B has a metal roof rack installed, which is visibly holding multiple surfboards. These surfboards are arranged horizontally and come in bright colors—red, yellow, and turquoise—indicating they are meant for surfing. The presence of these boards, combined with their secure placement on the rack, confirms that the van is equipped with a roof rack loaded with colorful surfboards. This setup is typical of beach-bound recreational vehicles.",

      "question": "Is the image captured in a sunny, slightly desaturated photographic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is bright and even, suggesting a sunny day, as evidenced by the clear shadows under the van and the high visibility of details across the scene. However, the colors appear somewhat muted or softened, especially in the sky and sand, which gives the image a slightly desaturated look. This effect is often used in retro-style photography to evoke nostalgia. The overall tone has a warm, vintage feel with reduced color saturation, aligning with the described photographic style.",

      "question": "Does the van have design elements typical of a vintage surf van from the nineteen seventies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The van in Image B exhibits several design characteristics associated with 1970s-era vans, particularly those popular among surfers. These include the boxy body shape, rounded corners, split windshield, chrome bumpers, and distinctive two-tone paint job. The presence of a roof rack with surfboards further reinforces the surf van identity. Additionally, the overall styling, including the grille design and wheel covers, closely resembles models like the Mercedes-Benz T2 from the 1970s. These elements collectively indicate that the van embodies the aesthetic and functional traits of a vintage surf van from that era.",
