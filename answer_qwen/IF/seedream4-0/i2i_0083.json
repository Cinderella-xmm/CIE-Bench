        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall where the painting was previously located now features a digital display screen. The space is occupied by a modern flat-screen device with a blue interface showing weather data, which clearly replaces the original artwork. Since the painting is no longer visible and has been replaced by another object, it can be concluded that the painting has been removed. This conclusion is based on visual evidence of the absence of the original painting and the presence of a new object in its place.",

      "question": "Has a digital display screen been added in place of the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a large flat-panel display mounted on the wall in the exact location where the painting was previously hung. The screen displays a digital interface with weather information, including temperature, cloud cover, and graphical data, indicating it is an active digital display. Given that this screen is positioned where the painting once was and serves as a replacement, it confirms that a digital display screen has indeed been added to replace the painting. This inference combines visual observation with common understanding of how such installations are typically performed—replacing wall art with electronic devices in interior design.",

      "question": "Does the digital display screen show real-time weather imagery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The screen displays various weather-related elements such as temperature (e.g., '37'), cloud icons, wind indicators, and graphs resembling weather trends over time. These elements are typical of real-time weather dashboards used in smart homes or public spaces. While the image does not provide a timestamp or live feed confirmation, the layout and content strongly resemble those of real-time weather applications like those from meteorological services or smart home systems. Therefore, based on the visual cues and general knowledge about such interfaces, it is reasonable to infer that the screen is displaying real-time weather imagery.",

      "question": "Is the digital display screen positioned in the same location as the original painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing the two images, the digital display screen in Image B is centered on the wall and occupies the same vertical and horizontal space as the original painting in Image A. The framing and alignment relative to the two armchairs below remain consistent, suggesting that the screen has been installed in the exact same spot. This positioning maintains symmetry and balance in the room’s layout. The consistency in placement supports the conclusion that the screen is in the same location as the original painting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The room's composition remains balanced because the digital display is centered between the two identical armchairs, mirroring the original arrangement. The size and proportions of the screen are similar to the painting, preserving visual harmony. Additionally, the color contrast between the dark screen and the light wall is comparable to the contrast created by the framed painting, maintaining aesthetic equilibrium. Although the content has changed from artistic to functional, the spatial relationship and symmetry have been preserved, indicating that the overall composition and balance of the room have been maintained.",
