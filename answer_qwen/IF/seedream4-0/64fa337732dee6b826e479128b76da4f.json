      "question": "Is the woman depicted as a chibi-style character with an oversized head and simplified proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is clearly rendered in a stylized, cartoonish manner typical of chibi art. Her head is disproportionately large compared to her body, a hallmark of chibi design. The facial features are simplified—large round eyes, small nose, and a minimal mouth—further reinforcing this style. Additionally, her limbs are short and rounded, lacking anatomical detail, which aligns with common chibi aesthetics. This contrasts sharply with realistic human proportions seen in traditional portraiture. Based on these visual cues and knowledge of chibi art conventions, the depiction matches the definition of a chibi-style character.",

      "question": "Does the image have a design consistent with a collectible fridge magnet, such as a border or background suggesting it is a small, flat object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a distinct border composed of uniformly sized pearl-like elements arranged in a square frame around the central figure. This type of decorative border is commonly found on collectible items like fridge magnets, especially those designed for display or gifting. The flatness of the image, combined with the uniform lighting and lack of depth cues, suggests it is meant to be viewed as a two-dimensional object. Furthermore, the overall aesthetic—stylized, colorful, and framed—is typical of novelty collectibles. These visual elements, combined with common design practices for such items, support the conclusion that the image resembles a collectible fridge magnet.",

      "question": "Is the gown rendered with oversized, vibrant frills and visible lace detailing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gown in Image B is characterized by exaggerated, voluminous frills, particularly at the sleeves and hemline, which are significantly larger and more pronounced than would be typical in historical fashion. The color of the dress is a bright, vibrant blue, enhancing its playful and stylized appearance. White lace trim is clearly visible along the edges of the sleeves and hem, adding texture and detail consistent with ornamental design. These features are amplified beyond realism, aligning with the whimsical nature of chibi art. In contrast to the more subdued and historically accurate rendering in Image A, Image B's gown emphasizes visual flair over authenticity, confirming the presence of oversized, vibrant frills and detailed lace.",

      "question": "Are all pieces of jewelry on the character adorned with noticeable gold accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character wears multiple pieces of jewelry: a necklace, earrings, bracelets, and a ring. Each of these items is distinctly golden in color and appears to have metallic sheen, consistent with gold accents. The necklace features a prominent circular pendant, the earrings are small but clearly gold, the bracelets include both a beaded strand and a solid band, both gold-toned, and the ring on her finger is also gold. There is no indication of silver or other materials; all visible jewelry shares a cohesive golden hue. This uniformity in material and color reinforces the idea that all jewelry has noticeable gold accents. While Image A shows similar jewelry, the materials appear more realistically rendered, whereas Image B stylizes them uniformly in gold for visual consistency.",

      "question": "Is the furniture depicted in a colorful, miniature style consistent with a chibi-themed scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The furniture in Image B includes a sofa that is rendered in bright, contrasting colors—blue upholstery with red and orange armrests and yellow legs. Its proportions are exaggeratedly small and rounded, matching the scale and style of the chibi character. The design lacks realistic depth and texture, appearing flat and toy-like, which is characteristic of miniature or dollhouse-style furnishings often used in chibi art. This contrasts with the more subdued and proportionally accurate furniture in Image A, which reflects a real-world setting. The vivid color palette and simplified form in Image B strongly suggest a miniature, stylized environment appropriate for a chibi-themed scene.",

      "question": "Is there a decorative border made of pearls or pearl-like elements surrounding the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is enclosed by a square frame composed of evenly spaced, spherical elements that resemble pearls. These elements are uniformly white or off-white, glossy, and arranged in a continuous pattern around the entire perimeter of the image. Their appearance and arrangement are highly consistent with decorative pearl borders commonly used in collectible items or themed artwork. This feature is not present in Image A, which has a plain, dark wooden frame typical of classical portraits. The inclusion of this pearl-like border in Image B serves both an aesthetic and symbolic purpose, enhancing the luxurious and whimsical theme of the piece.",
