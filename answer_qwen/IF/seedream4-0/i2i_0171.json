      "question": "Does the figurine maintain the skier's exact pose from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine depicts a skier in a dynamic skiing pose, leaning forward with arms extended and ski poles angled backward, consistent with an active descent. However, the pose is stylized and slightly exaggerated for aesthetic or structural reasons typical of collectible figurines. In contrast, the skier in Image A is captured mid-action on a real slope, with natural body positioning influenced by gravity, snow resistance, and motion dynamics. While both figures show a similar general posture—leaning into a turn with poles out—the figurine in Image B appears more rigid and less fluid in movement, especially in the arm and leg alignment. Additionally, the angle of the skis and the position of the poles differ subtly; the figurine’s skis are parallel and flat on a base, whereas in Image A, the skis are angled and kicking up snow, indicating motion. Therefore, while the overall pose is inspired by the original, it is not an exact replication due to the constraints of figurine design and display.",

      "question": "Are the skis designed to be detachable from the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skis are fixed onto the figurine’s boots and appear to be integrated into the base structure. There are no visible joints, hinges, or gaps that would suggest they can be removed. The skis are firmly attached to the figurine and rest on a circular platform covered in simulated snow, which further indicates they are part of a single unit. Collectible figurines typically have non-detachable components unless specifically designed for modularity, and there is no indication here of such a feature. Based on visual inspection and common design practices for action figures or collectibles, the skis are not meant to be detached.",

      "question": "Is there a magnetic snow powder base attached to the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base beneath the figurine in Image B is a solid black circular platform with a layer of artificial snow on top. There is no visible evidence of magnets or any mechanism that would suggest magnetism. The snow-like material appears to be static and molded into the base, serving purely as a decorative element to simulate a snowy environment. Magnetic bases are typically used in interactive displays or modular setups, but there is no indication of such functionality here. Furthermore, the figurine stands firmly without any signs of floating or alignment cues that would imply magnetic attachment. Therefore, based on visual analysis and typical product design, the base is not magnetic.",

      "question": "Have packaging illustrations been added alongside the figurine design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a product box is visible in the background, labeled 'SUPERKI' with an illustration of the same skier character in a skiing pose. This packaging features a stylized version of the figurine, including the skis, poles, and outfit, clearly mirroring the design of the actual figurine. The inclusion of this box with artwork directly related to the figurine suggests that packaging illustrations have indeed been created and displayed alongside the figurine. These illustrations serve marketing and identification purposes, showing potential buyers what the product looks like. Thus, the presence of the box with matching artwork confirms that packaging illustrations were added.",

      "question": "Does the figurine include details like ski poles and a backpack if they were part of the skier's original pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine includes ski poles held in each hand, just as seen in Image A. The poles are detailed with red tips and are positioned in a way that reflects the skier’s active stance. Additionally, the figurine has a backpack strapped to its back, matching the gear worn by the skier in Image A. Both elements—the ski poles and the backpack—are present and accurately represented in the figurine. These accessories are essential parts of the original skier’s appearance and are faithfully reproduced in the collectible version. Given that these items were part of the original pose and are visibly included in the figurine, the answer is affirmative.",
