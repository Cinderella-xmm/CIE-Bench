    "Question": "Q1: Has a person been added to the image near the zebra's tail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a human figure is visible on the left side of the frame, partially cropped, with only the lower half of the body shown — including legs, feet, and part of the torso. The person is wearing dark pants and shoes and appears to be walking alongside the zebra. This figure is not present in Image A, where the scene contains only the zebra and natural elements. Given that the person is positioned close to the zebra’s tail and there is no indication of such a presence in the original image, it is reasonable to conclude that the person has been added in the edited version. This conclusion is supported by the abruptness of the figure’s appearance and the lack of natural integration (e.g., shadows or depth cues) that would suggest the person was originally there.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the zebra have its head partially turned toward the person?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is facing right, with its head slightly angled forward and to the side, giving the impression that it is looking toward the direction of the person. While the zebra is not directly facing the person, its head is turned enough to suggest awareness or attention toward the nearby human. In contrast, in Image A, the zebra is bent down drinking water with its head fully lowered and facing forward, showing no indication of turning toward any external stimulus. The change in head orientation from Image A to Image B supports the inference that the zebra has shifted its gaze, likely due to the presence of the person. Therefore, based on visual cues and typical animal behavior, the zebra’s posture suggests partial attention toward the person.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the person's foot positioned near or on the zebra's tail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the person’s right foot is positioned very close to the base of the zebra’s tail, appearing to almost touch or step on it. The proximity is notable, and the positioning seems unnatural given the size difference and typical animal-human interaction dynamics. However, the foot does not appear to be fully on the tail but rather just beside or brushing against it. This detail contrasts with Image A, where no human is present, so there is no such interaction. The placement of the foot in Image B is suspiciously close and may indicate digital manipulation, but visually, it is near the tail. Based on spatial analysis, 'near' is more accurate than 'on'.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the original elements of the watering hole and surrounding environment maintained?",
    "explanation": "The watering hole, dry ground, rocks, and general landscape in Image B appear consistent with those in Image A. The water surface, the edge of the bank, and the arrangement of large stones in the background are nearly identical. There are no visible distortions, additions, or removals in the environmental elements. Even though a person has been added, the natural setting remains unchanged. This suggests that while the subject (the zebra) and an additional element (the person) have been modified, the background environment has been preserved. Thus, the original elements of the scene remain intact.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the zebra's expression and posture indicate it is startled?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra’s posture shows it walking away from the water, with its head raised and ears slightly forward, which could suggest alertness. However, there are no clear signs of fear — such as wide eyes, flared nostrils, or tensed muscles — that would indicate being startled. Its gait appears calm and controlled, not frantic. In comparison to Image A, where the zebra is calmly drinking water, the transition in Image B shows a shift in behavior, possibly due to the presence of the person. But this shift is more indicative of cautious awareness than a startled reaction. Therefore, while the zebra may be attentive, it does not display classic signs of being startled.",
    "answer": "No"
