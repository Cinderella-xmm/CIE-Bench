      "question": "Is the elderly man depicted in a cartoon style with simplified features and exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man is rendered with clean, smooth lines and flat color fills typical of 2D animation or cartoon art. His facial features—such as the eyes, nose, and mouth—are stylized and less detailed than realistic depictions, with exaggerated proportions like a larger head relative to his body and simplified hair and beard. These characteristics align with common cartoon aesthetics, where realism is sacrificed for visual clarity and expressive appeal. The lack of fine shading, texture, and depth further supports the conclusion that this is a cartoon-style illustration rather than a photorealistic one.",

      "question": "Has the cane been replaced with a golden scepter featuring an ornate or regal design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cane held by the elderly man in Image B is distinctly different from a standard walking stick. It is golden in color, with a highly decorative top resembling a crown or royal insignia, suggesting a regal or ceremonial purpose. This design is consistent with a scepter—a symbol of authority often seen in royal or fantasy contexts. In contrast, the cane in Image A appears more utilitarian and wooden, without any ornate embellishments. The transformation in Image B clearly indicates a replacement of a practical walking aid with a symbolic, ornate scepter, reinforcing a shift toward a more regal or fantastical theme.",

      "question": "Are all elements of the man’s clothing rendered in soft, muted pastel colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The man's clothing in Image B includes a light brown coat, beige trousers, a cream-colored sweater vest, and a reddish-brown tie. While these colors are relatively soft and warm, they are not uniformly muted or pastel. The red tie and the gold of the scepter introduce richer, more saturated tones. Additionally, the overall palette leans toward earthy and warm hues rather than the delicate, pale shades typically associated with pastel colors. Therefore, although some elements are soft, not all clothing components fall within the pastel range.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the man standing on a stylized cobblestone path with artistic or non-realistic stone patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ground beneath the man in Image B consists of cobblestones arranged in a pattern that is orderly and somewhat idealized. The stones are uniformly shaped and colored, with clear, sharp edges and consistent spacing, which deviates from natural cobblestone layouts that tend to be irregular and varied. The path also has a slightly curved, flowing design that enhances its aesthetic appeal over realism. This stylization suggests an artistic interpretation rather than a realistic representation, typical of animated or illustrated environments.",

      "question": "Are there visible detachable sections or margins around the print intended for personal notes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes several paper-like elements surrounding the central illustration. These include lined sheets with torn edges, perforated borders, and blank spaces that resemble notebook pages or stationery. Some of these papers have staples, tabs, or postmarks, indicating they are designed to look like detachable notes or annotations. These elements are placed around the image as if part of a scrapbook or journal layout, suggesting functionality for personal writing or labeling. This design choice implies that the image is meant to be interactive or used as a template for adding notes.",

      "question": "Are there visible stamped details (e.g., seal-like graphics, ink marks, or insignias) around the print?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, there are multiple stamped details visible in Image B. On the bottom right, there is a circular red stamp with text and an emblem resembling a royal or official seal. Another similar stamp appears on the top left, along with a crown motif. These stamps mimic postal or governmental seals and add to the document-like aesthetic of the image. Such elements are commonly used in illustrations to suggest authenticity, formality, or historical context. Their presence confirms that the image includes intentional stamped details.",
