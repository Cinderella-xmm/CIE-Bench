      "question": "Has the English manor-style house been replaced with a structure composed of fragmented, colorful geometric planes consistent with cubist art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original architectural form of the English manor-style house has undergone a radical transformation. Instead of realistic brickwork and traditional gabled roofs, the building is now composed of numerous angular, brightly colored geometric shapes—triangles, rectangles, and parallelograms—that overlap and intersect in a manner reminiscent of Cubist art. This style, characterized by fragmentation and multiple perspectives, breaks down the three-dimensional form into abstract planes. The use of vibrant, non-naturalistic colors further aligns with artistic movements like Cubism or digital surrealism. This contrasts sharply with the realistic architectural rendering seen in typical photographic depictions of such buildings. Therefore, based on visual cues and knowledge of art styles, the house has indeed been replaced with a Cubist-inspired structure.",

      "question": "Are the original brick surfaces of the house replaced with vibrant, non-uniform geometric planes rather than realistic masonry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the surface texture of the house no longer displays realistic brick patterns or mortar lines. Instead, it features an array of flat, brightly colored geometric planes that vary in hue and orientation. These planes do not follow any natural masonry pattern but are arranged in a way that suggests abstraction and artistic reinterpretation. In contrast, Image A shows a traditional brick façade with visible horizontal courses and consistent coloration typical of real-world construction. The replacement of realistic masonry with these non-uniform, colorful fragments indicates a deliberate stylistic shift toward abstraction. Thus, the original brick surfaces have been replaced.",

      "question": "Have all individuals in the crowd been rendered as abstract, faceless, and scattered forms devoid of detailed features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the people in the crowd are depicted not as realistic human figures but as simplified, stylized silhouettes. They appear as flat, two-dimensional shapes with minimal detail—no facial features, clothing textures, or anatomical accuracy. Their forms are often reduced to basic outlines or solid-colored blocks, resembling cutouts or symbols. This abstraction is consistent across the entire crowd, suggesting a uniform artistic treatment. In comparison, Image A shows clearly defined individuals with discernible clothing, postures, and spatial relationships. The transformation in Image B reflects a deliberate move toward abstraction, where individual identity is erased in favor of symbolic representation. Hence, all individuals have been rendered in this abstract manner.",

      "question": "Does the grass surface feature a visible checkered pattern overlaying the entire green area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals that the grassy terrain is no longer uniformly green but is instead overlaid with a repeating checkerboard-like pattern composed of alternating light and dark green squares. This grid extends across the entire fairway and surrounding areas, including near the water's edge. The pattern is geometric and regular, suggesting a digital or artistic intervention rather than natural landscaping. In contrast, Image A shows a smooth, continuous green surface typical of a well-maintained golf course, without any such pattern. The presence of this checkered overlay in Image B is a clear departure from realism and aligns with the overall abstract aesthetic. Therefore, the grass does feature a visible checkered pattern.",

      "question": "Has the water reflection been transformed into a series of prismatic, angular shards that distort and fragment the image of the house and surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface no longer reflects the scene realistically. Instead, it is filled with sharp, multi-colored triangular and polygonal shards that resemble broken glass or prisms. These fragments reflect distorted, kaleidoscopic versions of the house and sky, breaking up the image into disjointed pieces. This effect creates a sense of visual disorientation and abstraction, contrasting sharply with the smooth, mirror-like reflection seen in Image A, where the house and sky are clearly mirrored in the water. The transformation of the reflection into angular, prismatic shards is a hallmark of digital artistic manipulation, aiming to enhance the surreal and cubist theme. Thus, the water reflection has indeed been transformed in this way.",
