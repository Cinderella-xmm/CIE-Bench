      "question": "Is the image rendered in a flat, two-dimensional fresco style with minimal depth and strong outlines, resembling ancient Indian wall paintings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features a large mural that includes a divine figure with multiple arms, symbolic motifs such as an eye, an 'Om' symbol, and floral patterns. These elements are painted in a style reminiscent of traditional Indian temple murals or frescoes. However, the overall rendering of the image is not flat or two-dimensional; instead, it has a strong sense of depth and three-dimensionality due to lighting, shadows, and realistic textures on the woman’s clothing and surroundings. The figures and objects have volume and perspective, which contradicts the characteristics of a true fresco-style painting. While the mural itself has a fresco-like aesthetic, the entire image is a photorealistic composite rather than a flat, outlined depiction. Therefore, the image does not fully conform to a two-dimensional fresco style.",

      "question": "Has the woman’s outfit been replaced with vibrant, flowing traditional Indian dance attire, such as a sari or similar garment with ornate patterns and fabric folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is wearing a richly colored outfit composed of red and orange fabrics with intricate borders and embellishments. The garment includes a draped upper piece resembling a choli (a traditional blouse), a long skirt-like lower garment (possibly a lehenga or dhoti-style pants), and a flowing dupatta (scarf) that drapes over her shoulder and flows behind her. This attire is characteristic of classical Indian dance costumes, particularly those used in Bharatanatyam or Kathak performances. The fabric appears lightweight and dynamic, capturing motion in the folds, suggesting it is designed for expressive movement. Unlike the simple athletic wear in Image A, this outfit is elaborate and culturally specific, clearly indicating a transformation into traditional Indian dance attire.",

      "question": "Are the woman’s garments adorned with colorful, detailed patterns consistent with traditional Indian textile art, such as embroidery, block prints, or meenakari-style designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman’s attire in Image B displays a high level of detail, including geometric and floral patterns along the edges of the fabric, gold trim, and ornamental motifs. These patterns resemble traditional Indian textile techniques such as zari work (metallic thread embroidery), block printing, and possibly meenakari-inspired designs often seen in royal or ceremonial garments. The use of contrasting colors—red, orange, blue, and gold—along with symmetrical borders and intricate detailing aligns closely with South Asian textile artistry. These design elements are not present in the plain athletic wear of Image A, further emphasizing the cultural transformation in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the background feature mural-like designs with sacred Indian symbols, such as lotuses, om signs, or divine figures, painted in a fresco style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is dominated by a large, detailed mural depicting a multi-armed deity, likely representing a Hindu goddess such as Lakshmi or Durga. Surrounding this central figure are various sacred symbols: an 'Om' sign enclosed in a circular motif, a stylized eye (possibly the 'Third Eye' or 'Eye of Providence'), and lotus-like floral patterns. These symbols are deeply rooted in Indian spirituality and are commonly found in temple art and religious iconography. The artistic style of the mural mimics ancient frescoes with earthy tones and aged textures, reinforcing its resemblance to traditional Indian wall paintings. This contrasts sharply with the minimalist, modern interior of Image A, which lacks any religious or symbolic artwork.",

      "question": "Are there cultural artifacts such as oil lamps, incense holders, or decorative architectural elements integrated into the scene to reflect a spiritual or ritualistic setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes several cultural artifacts that contribute to a spiritual ambiance. On either side of the woman, there are ornate brass oil lamps (diyas) with lit flames, which are traditionally used in Hindu rituals and temples. Additionally, there are decorative elements such as tassels, hanging ornaments, and a golden throne-like structure in the corner, all of which are consistent with Indian temple aesthetics. These items enhance the ritualistic and sacred atmosphere of the scene. In contrast, Image A contains only modern decor like candles and a ladder, lacking any religious or cultural artifacts. The presence of these traditional items in Image B confirms the integration of spiritual elements into the environment.",

      "question": "Is the woman still performing the tree pose (Vrikshasana) with one foot placed on the inner thigh of the standing leg and hands in Anjali Mudra above her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B maintains the classic tree pose (Vrikshasana). Her right foot is positioned on the inner thigh of her left standing leg, balancing gracefully. Her arms are raised overhead, palms pressed together in Anjali Mudra, a gesture of reverence and focus common in yoga practice. This posture is identical to the one performed in Image A, despite the significant changes in clothing and setting. The alignment of her body—straight spine, balanced stance, and hand position—confirms that she is correctly executing Vrikshasana. The pose remains unchanged even though the context has shifted from a modern studio to a traditional Indian spiritual space.",
