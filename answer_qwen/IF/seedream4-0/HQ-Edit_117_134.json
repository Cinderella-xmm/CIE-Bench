      "question": "Is the grand piano replaced with a cookie sculpture that retains the same overall shape and structure as the original piano?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object is clearly not a real grand piano but a sculpted cookie designed to resemble one. The overall silhouette—curved top lid, keyboard section, and supporting legs—is preserved, indicating an intentional replication of the piano's form. Despite being made of edible material, the cookie maintains the iconic shape of a grand piano, including the angled lid and the keyboard layout. This suggests that the artist aimed to preserve the structural essence of the original instrument while transforming it into a confectionery art piece. Based on visual cues such as the rounded edges, the keyboard-like pattern at the bottom, and the general proportions, it is evident that the cookie mimics the piano’s structure closely.",

      "question": "Is the surface of the piano sculpture uniformly colored in a rich caramel hue instead of glossy black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the cookie sculpture in Image B exhibits a consistent golden-brown color typical of baked gingerbread or similar cookies. This warm, caramel-like tone contrasts sharply with the deep, reflective black finish of the original piano seen in Image A. There are no signs of glossiness or dark paint; instead, the texture appears matte and porous, characteristic of baked dough. The uniformity of this hue across the entire body of the cookie confirms that it has been replaced with a food-based material that lacks the polished, lacquered appearance of the original piano. Therefore, the surface has indeed shifted from glossy black to a rich caramel hue.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible white and gold icing designs on the cookie piano that replicate the ornate details of the original piano?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the cookie sculpture in Image B, intricate decorative elements are visible along its surface. These include piped white icing forming scrollwork, borders, and architectural motifs reminiscent of baroque design—similar to the elaborate carvings and gilded patterns found on high-end musical instruments or concert halls. Additionally, gold-colored accents enhance certain features such as columns, keystones, and floral patterns. These decorations mirror the opulent aesthetic often associated with grand pianos displayed in luxurious venues like the one shown in the background. While the original piano in Image A does not have visible icing, it may feature subtle metallic trim or wood inlays; however, the cookie version explicitly uses icing to emulate such ornamental details. Thus, the presence of white and gold icing directly corresponds to an artistic interpretation of the piano’s elegance.",

      "question": "Are the piano keys made of embedded sugar crystals rather than solid black or white material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keyboard portion of the cookie sculpture in Image B shows alternating black and white segments that resemble piano keys. However, these are not made of solid materials like plastic or wood. Instead, they appear to be crafted from icing: the white keys are formed with smooth white icing, while the black keys are created using dark icing or possibly edible paint. There is no visible evidence of sugar crystals being embedded into the keys. Sugar crystals would likely appear translucent, granular, or sparkling under light, which is not observed here. The keys have a flat, uniform surface consistent with piped icing rather than crystalline textures. Therefore, despite their realistic appearance, the keys are not composed of embedded sugar crystals but are instead constructed from standard icing techniques.",

      "question": "Is the cookie piano positioned on a plain white marble tabletop, devoid of any surrounding stage, audience, or theater elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookie piano is placed on a clean, rectangular surface with a white and gray veined pattern characteristic of marble. The table supports the cookie and occupies the foreground, isolating it from the rest of the environment. Behind the table, the background reveals a detailed view of a grand theater interior, complete with red seats, balconies, chandeliers, and ornate ceiling frescoes—elements identical to those in Image A. Although the cookie itself is presented on a simple tabletop, the surrounding context includes full theatrical elements such as seating, lighting, and architectural details. This indicates that the setting has not been stripped down to just the table and cookie. Hence, while the cookie is elevated on a marble surface, the broader environment still contains stage and audience elements.",
