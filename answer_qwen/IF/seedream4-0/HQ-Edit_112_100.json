      "question": "Is the eagle enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eagle is clearly positioned inside a large, curved, transparent structure that resembles a glass dome. The dome is sealed at the base and appears to be made of clear glass or acrylic, allowing full visibility of the eagle and surrounding decorative elements. This type of display is commonly used to protect and showcase collectible sculptures. Based on the visual cues—such as reflections, transparency, and the way light interacts with the surface—the object is indeed a glass dome. Therefore, the eagle is enclosed within it.",

      "question": "Does the eagle appear as a 3D stylized sculpture with sculptural features (e.g., defined form, modeling lines, or material texture)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eagle in Image B exhibits characteristics of a three-dimensional sculpture. It has well-defined contours, visible feather textures, and pronounced modeling lines along its wings and body, indicating it is not a flat image but a physical object. The lighting highlights depth and volume, especially in the layered feathers and the curvature of the wings. Additionally, the presence of gold leaf accents and the way the surface reflects light suggest a solid, textured material like resin or ceramic. These features are consistent with a stylized 3D sculpture rather than a photograph or painting.",

      "question": "Are there miniature swirling clouds located directly under the eagle's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are white, cloud-like forms positioned beneath the eagle’s wings. These clouds are stylized with swirling patterns and are placed in a way that suggests they are part of the display’s base or internal decoration. They are not real clouds but sculpted representations, likely made of porcelain or plaster. Their placement directly under the wings gives the impression that the eagle is flying above them. This aligns with common decorative motifs in ornamental displays, where clouds are used to enhance the illusion of flight.",

      "question": "Are the miniature clouds under the eagle’s wings decorated with visible gold leaf accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature clouds beneath the eagle’s wings in Image B are white and feature smooth, curvilinear shapes typical of sculpted clouds. However, upon close inspection, there are no visible gold leaf accents on these clouds themselves. The gold leaf is present on the eagle’s body and wings, but the clouds remain plain white. This distinction is important because gold leaf would reflect light differently and create noticeable highlights. Since none are present on the clouds, they are not decorated with gold leaf.",

      "question": "Is the base of the display made of polished dark wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base supporting the glass dome in Image B has a rich, dark brown color with a high-gloss finish that reflects light, consistent with polished dark wood such as mahogany or walnut. The grain pattern is visible, and the surface has a warm, lustrous sheen typical of fine wooden furniture or display stands. Additionally, the base is circular and substantial, matching the aesthetic of luxury collectibles. This visual evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the base is made of polished dark wood.",

      "question": "Is the phrase \"Noble Sky Guardian\" visibly engraved on the base of the display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the front of the wooden base in Image B, the words 'Noble Sky Guardian' are clearly visible in raised, golden lettering. The text is centered and appears to be either engraved or inlaid with gold foil or metal. Given the context of the display—a stylized eagle in a glass dome—it is plausible that this name serves as a title or theme for the piece. The legibility and positioning confirm that the phrase is intentionally displayed as part of the design.",

      "question": "Are there small brass compass roses placed around the base or exterior of the glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Surrounding the base of the display in Image B, there are several small, star-shaped objects with intricate designs resembling compass roses. These objects are metallic and have a golden hue consistent with brass. They are positioned on the wooden surface around the base, not attached to the dome itself. Compass roses are often used in nautical or aviation-themed decor, which complements the 'Sky Guardian' theme. Their placement and appearance confirm they are decorative brass compass roses.",
