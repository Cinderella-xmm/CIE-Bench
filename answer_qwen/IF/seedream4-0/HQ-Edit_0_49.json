      "question": "Is the teapot enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is clearly visible inside a large, curved, transparent structure that covers it entirely. This structure has the appearance of a glass dome, commonly used to display valuable or decorative items. The transparency allows full visibility of the teapot and surrounding objects, such as the porcelain cups beneath it. The reflections and refractions on the surface further confirm its glass-like material. Based on visual cues and common knowledge about display domes (e.g., cloches), this is consistent with a protective glass enclosure. There are no signs of seams or supports that would suggest otherwise, reinforcing the conclusion.",

      "question": "Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot sits atop a circular platform that reflects both the teapot and the surrounding porcelain cups. The reflection is clear, symmetrical, and sharp, indicating a highly polished, mirror-like surface. This reflective quality is consistent with mirrored bases used in display setups to enhance visual appeal. Additionally, the way light interacts with the surface—showing inverted images with high fidelity—confirms it is not just a shiny metal but specifically a reflective mirror finish. This aligns with common practices in showcasing ornamental items.",

      "question": "Are there small porcelain cups arranged in a circle around the base of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows multiple small cups positioned in a circular pattern around the base of the teapot. These cups are uniformly spaced and appear to be made of white porcelain with blue floral patterns, typical of fine tea sets. Their arrangement forms a complete ring around the central teapot, suggesting intentional placement for aesthetic or ceremonial purposes. The symmetry and repetition support the idea of a deliberate circular layout. This setup is consistent with traditional tea service presentations, where matching cups are displayed alongside the teapot.",

      "question": "Are there additional tiny, detailed engravings visible on the elevated surfaces of the teapot, amplifying its existing patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teapot in Image B features intricate, raised embossed designs across its body, including floral and scroll motifs. Upon close inspection, these patterns include fine lines and textures that suggest detailed engraving work. However, there is no evidence of 'additional' engravings beyond what is already part of the original design. The elevated surfaces do not show new layers or extra details that amplify the existing patterns; rather, they are consistent with a single, cohesive decorative style. The level of detail appears uniform and integrated, not layered or augmented post-production. Therefore, while the engravings are elaborate, there are no observable extra engravings added to elevate the design further.",

      "question": "Are there visible faux steam spirals rising upward from the teapot, forming curved, wispy trails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several translucent, swirling lines rise from near the spout and handle of the teapot. These lines are stylized and curl in elegant, spiral patterns, resembling steam. However, their smooth, perfect curves and lack of natural diffusion suggest they are digitally rendered or artistic representations rather than real vapor. Such 'faux steam' is commonly used in digital art to imply warmth or activity without physical realism. The presence of multiple identical spirals adds to the artificiality. Given this context and visual analysis, these are indeed faux steam spirals designed to enhance the scene's atmosphere.",
