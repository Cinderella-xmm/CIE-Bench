      "question": "Is the title \"Berry Good Breakfast Choices\" clearly visible on the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title 'Berry Good Breakfast Choices' is prominently displayed at the top of Image B. It uses a bold, stylized font with a combination of white and purple text, making it highly legible against the background. The placement at the top center ensures visibility and draws attention immediately. Based on visual cues, the text is clear and unobstructed, confirming its visibility.",

      "question": "Are there additional vibrant blueberry illustrations added to the surface of the pie slice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the pie slice has been enhanced with cartoon-style blueberry illustrations that are not present in the original photo (Image A). These blueberries are bright, exaggerated in size, and appear as if they were digitally overlaid onto the pie. They are clearly distinct from the real berries visible in the original image, indicating an artistic addition for visual appeal.",

      "question": "Are all illustrated blueberries labeled with specific nutritional information such as fiber, antioxidants, or vitamins?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, several illustrated blueberries have small pop-up boxes attached to them, containing nutritional data. For example, one box lists 'Fiber 3g', 'Antioxidants 500mg', and 'Vitamin C'. Another shows 'Manganese 0.4mg', 'Vitamin K 19mcg', etc. However, not every single illustrated blueberry has such a labelâ€”only a few do. Therefore, while some are labeled, not all are, meaning the statement 'all' is incorrect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tea mug has been anthropomorphized with cartoon features: it has eyes, a smiling mouth, rosy cheeks, arms, and legs. These elements are clearly drawn and give the mug a character-like appearance. This transformation is evident when compared to Image A, where the mug is plain and realistic. The addition of limbs and facial features confirms the cartoon-like nature of the mug in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the anthropomorphic tea mug displaying or presenting a healthy eating tip via text or gesture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The anthropomorphic tea mug in Image B is holding a sign that reads 'healthy eating tips'. This indicates that it is actively presenting a message related to nutrition. The gesture of holding up the sign, combined with the textual content, demonstrates that the mug is serving as a presenter of health advice. This is consistent with common design practices in educational infographics where characters guide viewers through information.",

      "question": "Is there a minimalistic chart included that displays benefits of pairing berries and tea?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of Image B, there is a horizontal bar chart with labels such as 'Pammiel', 'Bererheart', 'Beaity', etc., which seem to be stylized versions of terms like 'Pomegranate', 'Heart Health', 'Beauty', etc. The chart visually compares different benefits associated with berries and tea, using bars of varying lengths. Although the labels are stylized or possibly misspelled, the presence of a structured, simplified chart aligns with the description of a minimalistic chart highlighting benefits.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the chart use warm pastel colors (e.g., soft orange, pink, yellow) to highlight its information?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chart at the bottom of Image B uses a color palette dominated by soft orange, light pink, and pale yellow tones. These colors are characteristic of warm pastels and are used consistently across the bar segments and background of the chart. This choice enhances readability and gives the infographic a friendly, approachable aesthetic typical of health-related visuals.",
