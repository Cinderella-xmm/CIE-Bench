      "question": "Does the edited image show the stapler from both the front and rear views side by side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two blue staplers are displayed on a green circular platform. The left stapler is oriented to show its front face, including the staple ejection area and the metal base plate. The right stapler is rotated to show its back, with the hinge and rear surface visible. This arrangement suggests that the image presents both the front and rear views of the same object. Based on common product photography practices, showing multiple angles side by side is typical for illustrating design features. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the image shows both the front and rear views.",

      "question": "Are the stapler's front and rear views arranged next to each other in a horizontal alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two views of the stapler are placed side by side along a horizontal axis. The front view is on the left, and the rear view is on the right, both resting on the same green circular platform. This layout clearly places them in a horizontal alignment, consistent with standard visual presentation methods for comparing different perspectives of an object. There is no vertical stacking or diagonal placement, confirming the horizontal arrangement.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all parts of the stapler visible in both the front and rear views without any truncation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, both the front and rear views of the stapler appear complete. The front view shows the full staple mechanism, base plate, and top handle. The rear view displays the entire back surface, including the hinge and side contours. Neither view appears cropped or cut off at the edges, and both fit within the frame of the image. There is no indication of missing components or obscured areas due to framing. Thus, all parts are visible without truncation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the front and rear views of the stapler in the edited image match in terms of color and design details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both staplers in Image B share identical color schemesâ€”bright blue plastic bodies with gold-colored metal components. The design elements such as the shape of the body, the position of the hinge, and the size and placement of the metal plates are consistent between the two views. Since they represent the same object from different angles, their matching appearance confirms that the color and design details are preserved across both views. This consistency supports accurate representation of the product.",

      "question": "Is the background consistent between the front and rear views of the stapler without additional elements introduced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a uniform green surface with a slightly darker green backdrop. Both the front and rear views of the stapler are placed on the same green circular platform, which sits against this consistent background. There are no differences in lighting, texture, or additional objects introduced between the two views. The continuity of the green surface and the absence of any new elements confirm that the background remains consistent across both views.",
