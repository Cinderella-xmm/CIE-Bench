      "question": "Is the image formatted as part of a multi-card art print collection, such as a panorama card within a curated set?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central illustration is displayed across multiple vertical panels, each separated by thin white borders, resembling individual cards or pages arranged side by side. These panels are contained within a larger structure that mimics an open book or album with textured leather-like covers on either side. The layout suggests a curated presentation, where the image spans several 'cards' to form a panoramic view. This format is consistent with a multi-card art print collection, particularly one designed for display in a photo album or collector's series. The uniform spacing and alignment of the panels reinforce the idea of a deliberate, segmented composition meant to be viewed as a cohesive set.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figure depicted in a cartoonized style with simplified features and smooth lines, rather than photorealistic detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B exhibits characteristics typical of a stylized or cartoonized artistic rendering. The limbs are drawn with clean, smooth outlines and lack fine anatomical details such as muscle definition or skin texture. Facial features are minimal—eyes are closed with simple curved lines, and the nose and mouth are subtly suggested without realistic depth. The overall silhouette is fluid and exaggerated, emphasizing grace over realism. Compared to photorealism, which would include shading, pores, and complex lighting effects, this image uses flat colors and simplified forms, aligning with a cartoon or illustrative aesthetic. This contrasts with the more detailed and lifelike rendering often seen in photographic representations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image limited to calming earth tones such as muted greens, browns, tans, and soft yellows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B is indeed dominated by calm, natural hues. The sky features soft gradients of pale yellow and peach, transitioning into light blue near the horizon. The sand is rendered in warm tans and beiges, while the ocean has subtle blues and whites. The figure’s clothing includes muted green and dark gray, both of which fall within the earth tone spectrum. There are no bright or jarring colors; instead, the tones are harmonious and subdued, evoking a serene, natural environment. This choice of color supports a tranquil atmosphere, consistent with yoga and mindfulness themes, and aligns with the use of earth tones to promote calmness and balance.",

      "question": "Are the figure’s limbs and body posture elongated and gracefully exaggerated beyond natural proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B displays exaggerated proportions typical of stylized illustrations. The arms and legs appear longer than average human anatomy, enhancing the sense of elegance and fluidity in the pose. The spine curves gracefully, and the raised leg extends upward with an almost impossible stretch, suggesting idealized flexibility. Such exaggeration is common in artistic depictions of yoga or dance, where the goal is to emphasize beauty and movement rather than anatomical accuracy. While real humans can achieve advanced poses, the depiction here pushes physical limits for visual effect, indicating intentional artistic exaggeration.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the beach elements (such as waves, sand, and rocks) rendered in a stylized, artistic manner rather than photorealistic detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beach elements in Image B are clearly stylized. The waves are represented by smooth, repetitive arcs with minimal texture, lacking the complexity of real water dynamics like foam, spray, or ripples. The sand is uniformly colored with faint horizontal lines suggesting wetness, but without granular detail. The rocks are simplified silhouettes with soft edges and no intricate surface textures. These elements are abstracted to complement the overall illustrative style of the image, prioritizing harmony and aesthetic appeal over realism. This approach is consistent with graphic design or editorial illustration, where clarity and mood take precedence over photorealism.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the figure display a tranquil facial expression with relaxed features and closed or gently focused eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B has closed eyes, indicated by softly curved lines, and a relaxed facial structure. The mouth is slightly parted but neutral, contributing to a peaceful demeanor. The head is tilted upward, reinforcing a meditative or contemplative state. In yoga imagery, closed eyes often symbolize inner focus and mindfulness. Given the context of a yoga pose at sunset, the serene expression aligns with the theme of tranquility. The absence of tension in the facial muscles further supports the interpretation of calmness and relaxation.",

      "question": "Is there a brief text element at the bottom of the image that reads a yoga-related tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of each panel in Image B, there is small, legible text printed beneath the illustration. The text appears to be in English and contains short phrases related to yoga or wellness. For example, one panel reads 'When you're balanced, you're not resisting the moment,' which is a philosophical statement commonly associated with yoga practice. Other panels contain similar inspirational or instructional messages. These texts are positioned consistently across all panels, suggesting they are part of a curated message or daily affirmation set. Their placement and content confirm that they serve as yoga-related tips or mantras.",

      "question": "Is the image presented within a frame or layout that simulates a textured photo album cover or tactile surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the artwork embedded within a structure resembling an open book or photo album. The left and right edges feature thick, textured covers—one appearing brown and the other teal—both with a grainy surface that mimics leather or faux leather material. The spine of the book is visible, and the pages are layered, giving a three-dimensional effect. This presentation creates the impression of a physical object with tactile qualities, designed to simulate a collectible or keepsake item. The overall layout enhances the perception of the image as part of a curated, tangible collection, reinforcing the idea of a simulated photo album or scrapbook.",
