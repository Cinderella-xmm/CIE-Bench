      "question": "Has the entire image been rendered in sepia tones consistent with a vintage postcard aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image exhibits a monochromatic color palette dominated by warm, earthy tones such as browns, tans, and muted yellows. This tonal scheme is characteristic of sepia coloring, commonly used in vintage photographs and postcards to evoke a sense of nostalgia and age. The overall lighting and contrast are subdued, enhancing the antique feel. Additionally, the edges of the image appear slightly faded and textured, resembling aged paper, which further supports the vintage postcard aesthetic. These visual cues—color tone, texture, and bordering effects—are consistent with how sepia-toned vintage images are typically presented.",

      "question": "Does the violinist's dress feature visible floral engravings across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the dress worn by the violinist, intricate patterns can be seen covering the fabric. These patterns include stylized flowers, leaves, and vines, arranged in a repeating decorative motif typical of traditional embroidery or printed textile designs. The floral elements are clearly defined and integrated into the dress’s design, particularly noticeable on the bodice and skirt. The level of detail suggests intentional artistic embellishment rather than plain fabric. This aligns with common historical fashion styles where floral patterns were popular for dresses, especially in vintage or romanticized depictions.",

      "question": "Has the view through the window been replaced with an abstract painted landscape composed of swirling patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The view through the window in Image B is not a realistic depiction of nature, such as trees or foliage, but instead features dynamic, swirling patterns in hues of brown, gold, and blue. These forms resemble brushstrokes and fluid motion, evoking the style of abstract expressionism or impressionistic painting. Unlike the original scene (which would show a natural outdoor environment), this version uses artistic abstraction to convey emotion or atmosphere. This transformation from a realistic view to a painted, expressive one indicates a deliberate stylistic choice to replace the real-world scenery with an abstract interpretation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible gold inlays on the violin’s body, neck, or scroll?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The violin in the image has distinct golden highlights along its body, particularly around the f-holes and the edges of the instrument. These areas reflect light differently than the rest of the wood, suggesting metallic inlays or gilded detailing. Such ornamentation is consistent with ornate violins used in classical or ceremonial contexts, where decorative elements like gold trim enhance both aesthetics and perceived value. The presence of these shiny, reflective sections confirms that gold inlays are present on the violin’s surface.",

      "question": "Is there a decorative handwritten music score forming a border around the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outer edge of the image contains musical notation written in cursive script, resembling handwritten staff lines with notes and clefs. These musical elements frame the central scene, running vertically along the sides and horizontally across the top and bottom. The handwriting style and musical symbols suggest a personal or artistic touch, reminiscent of old sheet music or a composer’s sketch. This framing device enhances the theme of music and adds to the vintage postcard aesthetic. The inclusion of such a border is a clear artistic choice to integrate musical motifs into the composition.",
