      "question": "Are detailed crochet stitches visibly present on the cactus and its sombrero?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus and its sombrero are clearly shown with visible texture that resembles crochet stitches. The surface of the cactus has distinct raised loops and patterns typical of hand-crocheted yarn work, particularly noticeable in the green body and the colorful striped sombrero. These textures are consistent with amigurumi-style crocheting, where individual stitches are often visible due to the tight, uniform pattern used. The details include small yellow lines representing spines on the cactus, which further enhance the handmade appearance. This level of detail is characteristic of crochet crafts, confirming that the stitches are indeed visible.",

      "question": "Does the donkey have a textured mane and a vibrant striped pattern on its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The donkey in Image B features a black, spiky mane made of what appears to be short, stiff fibers or yarn tufts, giving it a textured, bristly appearance. This mimics the natural look of a donkey's mane while maintaining a crafted aesthetic. Additionally, the donkey’s body displays a series of colorful horizontal stripes—orange, pink, purple, and teal—on its back, resembling traditional Mexican serape patterns. These stripes are vivid and well-defined, contributing to a festive, vibrant look. The combination of the textured mane and the bright, multi-colored stripes aligns with the decorative style seen in handmade amigurumi toys.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the crocheted cactus and donkey are placed within a brightly colored cardboard box. The front of the box prominently displays the text 'Knitted Amigos' in bold, playful lettering. The box itself is decorated with festive designs, including maracas, flowers, and flags, suggesting it is a retail package for these toys. The positioning of the two figures inside the box indicates they are presented as a set, likely for sale or gifting. This packaging context is consistent with commercial product presentation, especially for handmade or craft-themed items.",
