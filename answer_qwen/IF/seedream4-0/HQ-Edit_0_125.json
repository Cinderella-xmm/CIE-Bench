      "question": "Is the woman rendered in a semi-cartoon style with stylized features such as smooth lines, simplified facial structure, and exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's depiction exhibits characteristics typical of semi-cartoon or illustrative art styles. Her facial features are simplified—eyes are large and evenly shaped, eyebrows are clean and arched, and her smile is soft and idealized. The lines defining her hair and clothing are smooth and consistent, lacking the fine textural details seen in photorealistic images. Additionally, her proportions, such as the symmetry of her face and the slender form of her limbs, are slightly exaggerated for aesthetic appeal, which is common in stylized illustrations. These visual cues align with the conventions of semi-cartoon rendering, where realism is reduced in favor of clarity and visual harmony.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible gold-embossed floral details on the woman’s robe, particularly along the edges and central design areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman's robe in Image B features intricate patterns that resemble gold-embossed floral motifs. These designs are prominently displayed along the borders of the sleeves, the V-neckline, and vertically down the front panel of the dress. The floral elements include roses and leaves, rendered in a golden hue that contrasts with the red and blue fabric. The texture and sheen suggest an embossed or raised effect, giving the impression of metallic embroidery. This detail is consistent with traditional East Asian textile artistry, where gold thread is often used for decorative purposes. The clarity and precision of these patterns confirm their presence.",

      "question": "Do red lanterns surround the woman’s silhouette with a visible luminous glow effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several red lanterns are suspended above the woman, forming a string across the background. These lanterns emit a soft, warm glow that radiates outward, creating a subtle halo effect around them. The light appears to diffuse into the surrounding space, enhancing the festive ambiance. While the glow is not overly intense, it is clearly visible and contributes to the overall lighting of the scene. This luminous quality is consistent with how lanterns are depicted in artistic representations, especially during celebrations like Chinese New Year, where illumination plays a symbolic role.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background of the image designed to resemble soft cream-colored paper with a subtle texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B has a pale, off-white tone that mimics the appearance of aged or textured paper. It features a faint, uneven surface pattern that suggests a tactile quality, similar to handmade or watercolor paper. This texture is not uniform but varies slightly, adding depth without distracting from the main subject. The overall color palette is muted, reinforcing the impression of a delicate, paper-like surface. This design choice enhances the illustrative and artistic feel of the image, commonly used in calendar or greeting card designs to evoke warmth and tradition.",

      "question": "Are monthly calendar grids visibly integrated into the image, with their design based on the floral patterns from the woman’s robe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, faint grid structures resembling calendar layouts are visible in the background, particularly on the left and right sides of the image. These grids contain numbers arranged in rows and columns, consistent with a monthly calendar format. Notably, the design of these grids incorporates subtle floral motifs that echo the patterns found on the woman’s robe—such as roses and vines—suggesting a thematic continuity. The integration is understated, blending seamlessly into the background while maintaining functional legibility. This design approach is typical of decorative calendars where artistic elements are harmonized with practical information.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image include elements of a market scene—such as fruit stalls, hanging lanterns, and people shopping—and is it formatted as a calendar with monthly divisions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does feature elements suggestive of a market scene, including fruit stalls filled with oranges and apples, hanging red lanterns, and blurred figures that resemble shoppers. However, these elements are rendered in a faded, sketch-like manner, indicating they are part of a background motif rather than a fully realized setting. Additionally, the presence of calendar grids in the background confirms the image's function as a calendar. The division into monthly sections is evident through the structured layout of dates and days. Therefore, while the market scene is implied and stylistically incorporated, the image is clearly formatted as a calendar with monthly divisions, combining both thematic illustration and functional design.",
