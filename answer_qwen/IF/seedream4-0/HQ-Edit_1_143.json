      "question": "Is the laboratory scientist depicted in a semi-cartoon style with stylized features such as simplified lines or exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scientist is rendered with clean, smooth lines and simplified facial features, such as large eyes and a small nose, which are characteristic of cartoon or anime-style illustrations. The proportions of her face and body are slightly exaggerated compared to realistic human anatomy—her head is larger relative to her body, and her limbs are slender and stylized. These stylistic choices align with semi-cartoon art, where realism is reduced in favor of visual appeal and clarity. Additionally, the use of flat color fills and minimal shading further supports this interpretation. This contrasts with more photorealistic depictions seen in typical scientific imagery.",

      "question": "Are the laboratory apparatus (such as test tubes, microscope, and monitors) rendered with high detail and clarity to emphasize refinement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The laboratory equipment in Image B includes test tubes, a microscope, and digital displays. While these objects are clearly identifiable, their rendering is simplified and stylized rather than highly detailed. For instance, the test tubes have basic shapes with minimal surface texture, and the microscope lacks intricate mechanical details. The monitors show abstract data patterns but lack realistic screen textures or depth. The overall design prioritizes clarity and aesthetic harmony over technical precision. Therefore, although the apparatus is visible and functional in form, it does not exhibit the level of fine detail that would suggest 'high refinement' in a realistic sense.",

      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image teal and white, consistent with a sleek scientific aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features a color scheme dominated by shades of teal and white. Teal appears in the background elements, calendar borders, and liquid within lab glassware, while white is used for the scientist’s lab coat, text, and structural highlights. This combination evokes a modern, clean, and futuristic scientific atmosphere, commonly associated with tech-themed designs. The use of teal adds a cool, clinical tone, reinforcing the theme of advanced science and technology. This palette is intentional and cohesive throughout the image, supporting the description of a sleek scientific aesthetic.",

      "question": "Does the image include multiple monthly sections, each featuring a different scientific motif such as molecular structures or data patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a calendar layout with several monthly grids labeled with abbreviated month names like 'OCAIL', 'TUTR', 'TYVCR', and 'TLRX'. Each section contains a grid of dates, but there are no distinct scientific motifs (e.g., molecular structures or data patterns) associated with individual months. Instead, the background features recurring scientific icons such as beakers and graphs, but these are consistent across all sections rather than being unique per month. Thus, while scientific themes are present, they are not varied per monthly section as implied by the question.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there bold, tech-inspired headers (e.g., futuristic font, glowing or metallic effect) present above each monthly section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Above each monthly section in Image B, the month names are displayed in a clean, sans-serif font with a light blue or teal outline, giving them a slightly futuristic appearance. However, they do not feature glowing effects, metallic textures, or elaborate styling typically associated with 'tech-inspired' headers. The typography is simple and legible, designed for clarity rather than visual impact. While the overall design has a technological feel, the headers themselves lack the boldness and special effects described in the question.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are data visualization patterns (e.g., circular diagrams, grid layouts, or flowcharts) visibly integrated into the calendar design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, Image B incorporates various data visualization elements. Circular diagrams resembling molecular or cellular structures appear in the background behind the scientist. Grid layouts are evident in the calendar sections, and bar charts and line graphs are included in the upper-left corner. Additionally, the calendar itself uses structured grids to represent dates. These visualizations are seamlessly blended into the design, reinforcing the scientific theme. The presence of these patterns suggests an integration of data-driven aesthetics into the calendar format.",

      "question": "Does the image display a polished, reflective appearance consistent with high-quality gloss paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B is visually clean and professionally designed, it does not exhibit physical characteristics such as glare, reflections, or surface sheen that would indicate printing on high-quality gloss paper. The image appears as a digital illustration with flat lighting and no evidence of material texture or shine. Gloss paper typically shows subtle reflections from light sources, which are absent here. Therefore, although the image looks polished in terms of design, it does not simulate the physical properties of glossy paper.",
