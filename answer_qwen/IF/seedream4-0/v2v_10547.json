        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a squirrel is clearly visible in the lower-left portion of the image, positioned in front of the tall cypress tree. The squirrel is depicted with realistic fur texture and anatomical features, including a bushy tail, upright posture, and small paws holding what appears to be a nut. This animal is not present in the original version of the painting (Image A), which only contains natural landscape elements such as trees, buildings, and sky. The presence of the squirrel is an intentional addition, making it a focal point in the foreground. Based on visual evidence alone, the squirrel is unmistakably present.",

      "question": "Does the squirrel blend naturally with the painting's brushstrokes and color palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The squirrel in Image B is rendered in a photorealistic style, with smooth gradients and fine details in its fur, which contrasts sharply with the expressive, swirling brushstrokes characteristic of Van Gogh’s style. The painting's original technique uses thick impasto strokes and vivid, contrasting colors—especially blues, yellows, and whites—that create a dynamic, almost turbulent texture. In contrast, the squirrel lacks these stylistic brushstrokes and instead has a polished, digital appearance. Its coloration (reddish-brown, white underbelly) is consistent with real squirrels but does not harmonize with the exaggerated, symbolic use of color in the original work. Therefore, while the squirrel fits thematically within a night scene, it does not visually integrate with the painting’s artistic style.",

      "question": "Is the squirrel positioned in the foreground, closer to the viewer than other elements in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The squirrel is placed at the bottom-left corner of the composition, directly in front of the cypress tree, which is a prominent vertical element in the painting. It is situated on the ground plane, slightly overlapping the base of the tree, indicating that it is in the immediate foreground. Depth cues such as perspective and layering show that the town and hills are further back, and the sky is the farthest plane. Since the squirrel is unobstructed and appears larger relative to distant elements like houses, it is clearly positioned closer to the viewer than any other object in the scene. This placement emphasizes it as a new focal point in the foreground.",

      "question": "Does the addition of the squirrel maintain the overall harmony and composition of the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Van Gogh’s 'Starry Night' is renowned for its balanced composition, where the cypress tree acts as a strong vertical anchor connecting earth and sky, and the swirling patterns guide the viewer’s eye across the canvas. The addition of the squirrel disrupts this balance by introducing a new, highly detailed, and realistically rendered subject that breaks the stylistic unity. While the squirrel is positioned near the cypress tree, it draws attention away from the intended focus on the celestial and architectural elements. Furthermore, the realism of the squirrel clashes with the expressive, emotional style of the rest of the painting, creating a jarring visual effect. Thus, although the squirrel is placed logically in space, it undermines the aesthetic harmony and compositional integrity of the original artwork.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In terms of scale, the squirrel appears proportionally correct relative to the cypress tree and the surrounding landscape. The tree is significantly taller and wider, and the squirrel is small enough to appear as a plausible creature in that environment. Comparatively, the houses in the village are much smaller than the tree but still larger than the squirrel, suggesting a reasonable size hierarchy. However, given the stylized nature of the painting—where proportions are often exaggerated for expressive purposes—the squirrel’s realistic size may seem oddly precise compared to the more abstracted forms around it. Nonetheless, from a naturalistic standpoint, the squirrel’s size is appropriate for its environment. The key issue lies not in scale but in style and integration.",
