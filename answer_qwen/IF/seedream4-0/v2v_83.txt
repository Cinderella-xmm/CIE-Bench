    "Question": "Q1: Does the skater and skateboard have a 3D cartoon aesthetic with soft lighting?",
    "explanation": "The character in Image B is rendered in a stylized, three-dimensional form typical of modern animated or video game characters. The proportions are exaggerated slightly (e.g., large head, expressive eyes), which is characteristic of cartoon aesthetics. The lighting appears smooth and even, with soft shadows and highlights that suggest a non-photorealistic rendering style commonly used in 3D animation. The skateboard also has a simplified yet detailed design consistent with this aesthetic. These visual cues—smooth surfaces, rounded edges, and gentle shading—indicate a deliberate artistic choice to create a 3D cartoon look rather than a realistic one. This aligns with common practices in digital character design for games or animated media.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are skill stats or bars included on the character card?",
    "explanation": "On the right side of Image B, there is a vertical list of skill indicators labeled '[Skil.1 +x]', '[Skil1 +x]', 'Skil.12 +', and '[Skil2]+'. Each entry is accompanied by either a star or an 'X' symbol, suggesting a rating or progression system. While not traditional bar graphs, these elements function as skill representations, indicating performance levels or abilities. This format is typical of character cards in games where attributes are displayed in a compact, symbolic way. Therefore, despite not being full statistical bars, they serve the purpose of conveying skill-related information.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a title banner across the top and a nameplate at the bottom of the card?",
    "explanation": "At the top of Image B, there is a golden ribbon-style banner with the word 'MARAÎNCE' prominently displayed in bold, stylized text. This serves as a title or character name banner. At the bottom, there is a rectangular nameplate with the text 'Name: Intanisvor' inside it, framed by a decorative border. Both elements are standard components of character cards in gaming or collectible formats, designed to present identity and branding clearly. The presence of both a top banner and a bottom nameplate confirms the structure described in the question.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the background feature urban scenery and a clear sky?",
    "explanation": "The background of Image B shows a cityscape with buildings, palm trees, and a skatepark ramp, all indicative of an urban environment. The sky is bright blue with minimal clouds, suggesting a clear day. These elements are consistent with a typical urban outdoor setting often used in skateboarding-themed games or animations. The inclusion of architectural structures like multi-story buildings and paved areas reinforces the urban context, while the sky's clarity adds to the vibrant atmosphere. This matches the description of urban scenery under a clear sky.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the color palette include warm highlights and dynamic tones that complement the skateboard’s design?",
    "explanation": "The overall color scheme of Image B features warm tones such as reds, oranges, and yellows in the character's cap, the skateboard’s sun motif, and the ambient lighting. These warm highlights contrast with cooler blues and teals in the sky and skateboard base, creating a dynamic and visually engaging palette. The skateboard itself has a vibrant, abstract design with flowing waves in pink, blue, and purple, which harmonizes with the warm accents. This balance between warm and cool colors enhances visual appeal and ensures the skateboard stands out as a focal point. Such a palette is intentional in design to evoke energy and movement, aligning well with skate culture aesthetics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
