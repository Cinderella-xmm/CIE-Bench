      "question": "Is the image rendered in monochrome (grayscale)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is presented entirely in shades of gray, with no color present. This is evident from the absence of any chromatic hues and the uniform tonal range across all elements, including the horse, people, trailer, and background. The visual cues such as shadows, highlights, and textures are preserved in grayscale, which is consistent with monochrome rendering. This style is often used in promotional materials to evoke a classic or timeless feel. Based on this observation, it can be concluded that the image is indeed rendered in monochrome.",

      "question": "Are the event details written in rustic, slightly imperfect typography?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text at the top of the image, 'Riders & Reins Expo 2024,' uses a font style that mimics hand-carved or distressed lettering, featuring irregular edges, uneven spacing, and a textured appearance. This stylistic choice gives the typography a rustic and artisanal quality, commonly used in equestrian or rural-themed events to convey authenticity and tradition. Additionally, the smaller text below also maintains a similar aesthetic with subtle imperfections and texture, reinforcing the overall rustic theme. This aligns with common design practices for events aiming to project a natural, down-to-earth atmosphere.",

      "question": "Does the advertisement include the event name \"Riders & Reins Expo 2024,\" location \"Evergreen Equestrian Center, Olympia, WA,\" and date/time \"Saturday, September 14, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top portion of the image clearly displays the event name 'Riders & Reins Expo 2024' in large, prominent text. Directly beneath it, the location 'Evergreen Equestrian Center, Olympia, WA' is visible. Further down, the date and time are explicitly stated as 'Saturday, September 14, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM.' These details are repeated in a smaller font near the bottom of the image, ensuring clarity and emphasis. The inclusion of all three pieces of information—event name, location, and date/time—is consistent with standard advertising practices for public events, particularly those involving specific venues and schedules.",

      "question": "Is there visible space allocated for listing ticket prices and contact details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of the image, there is a section of text that includes phrases such as 'Tickets are available...' and 'Contact:...'. Although the full details are somewhat obscured by low contrast and small font size, the presence of structured lines indicating pricing ('$200'), contact numbers, and website URLs suggests that space has been intentionally allocated for ticket and contact information. This layout is typical in event advertisements where logistical details are grouped together at the bottom. The inclusion of such placeholders confirms that the design accounts for these essential elements, even if they are not fully legible at first glance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image appears to be vertically oriented, with the height exceeding the width, which is characteristic of portrait orientation. Standard letter-sized paper measures 8.5 inches by 11 inches, and the proportions of this advertisement closely match that ratio. The layout, with text at the top and bottom and a central image, is consistent with how content is typically arranged on a vertical page. Furthermore, the way the text flows and the placement of the image suggest it was designed to fit within a standard print format, making it likely that the advertisement is formatted in standard letter-sized portrait orientation.",
