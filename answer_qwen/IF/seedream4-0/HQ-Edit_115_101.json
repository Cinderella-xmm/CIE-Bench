      "question": "Has the pocket watch been transformed into a cylindrical glass vessel resembling a whiskey bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is clearly a glass bottle with a cylindrical shape and a cork stopper, which is characteristic of a whiskey or spirit bottle. The overall form has changed from the circular, metallic pocket watch seen in Image A to a transparent, amber-filled container. The transformation involves reshaping the original pocket watch into a new object that retains some decorative elements but fundamentally changes its structure and material. This change aligns with the concept of metamorphosis where one object is reimagined into another while preserving aesthetic motifs. Based on visual cues such as transparency, liquid content, and bottle-like proportions, it is evident that the pocket watch has been artistically transformed into a whiskey-style bottle.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ornate engravings from the original watch visible as embossed patterns on the surface of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle features intricate swirling designs that closely resemble the floral and scrollwork patterns found on the original pocket watch in Image A. These patterns are raised and appear embossed on the glass surface, suggesting they were derived from the original watch’s decorative motif. The symmetry and style of the engravings match those on the watch, indicating a deliberate preservation of design elements during the transformation. Given that both objects share identical ornamental styles, it is reasonable to conclude that the engravings from the original watch have been transferred and adapted onto the bottle’s surface as embossed patterns.",

      "question": "Is the center of the bottle labeled with the text \"Timeless Reserve\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central area of the bottle in Image B displays a circular label that includes the words 'Timeless Reserve' in a clear, elegant font. This label is positioned at the heart of the bottle's front face, surrounded by Roman numerals arranged in a clock-like fashion. The placement and typography suggest branding or product naming, consistent with premium spirits packaging. Since the text is legible and centrally located, it confirms that the label indeed reads 'Timeless Reserve'.",

      "question": "Are Roman numerals arranged in a circular pattern around the edge of the \"Timeless Reserve\" label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, surrounding the 'Timeless Reserve' text is a ring of Roman numerals (I through XII) evenly spaced along the perimeter of the central label. This arrangement mimics a clock face, reinforcing the theme of time and continuity suggested by the name 'Timeless Reserve'. The numerals are stylistically consistent with traditional clock faces and are clearly visible, forming a complete circle around the central text. This design choice echoes the original pocket watch’s dial, indicating a thematic continuity between the two images.",

      "question": "Has the top ring been transformed into a bottle cap with a visible cork stopper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper part of the bottle features a metallic band with a gold-colored ring and a black section adorned with an emblem—this serves as a cap. Above this cap is a natural-looking cork stopper, which is typical for high-end liquor bottles. In contrast, Image A shows a looped metal ring attached to the top of the pocket watch, used for carrying. The transformation from a functional ring to a sealing cap with a cork suggests a reimagining of the original component to suit the new object’s purpose. The presence of both the decorative cap and the cork indicates a successful adaptation of the top portion into a functional bottle closure.",

      "question": "Are there visible gold accents on the bottle, particularly on the cap, label, or embossed designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows gold elements throughout the bottle: the rim of the cap, the ring around the neck, the border of the central label, and parts of the embossed floral patterns all exhibit a golden hue. These accents enhance the luxurious appearance of the bottle and echo the metallic tones of the original pocket watch. The use of gold is consistent with premium branding and complements the dark amber liquid inside. Therefore, gold accents are present and strategically placed across multiple areas of the bottle.",
