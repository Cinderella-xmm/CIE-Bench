    "Question": "Q1: Has a poem been added at the bottom of the image?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is a visible text overlay at the bottom portion of the image. The text is enclosed in quotation marks and appears to be poetic in nature, describing a scene involving light, sound, and the bird. This textual element is not present in the original image (Image A), indicating that it has been added during editing. Based on visual cues such as font style, positioning, and content, it is clear that this is an intentional addition to the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the poem exactly read: “A beam of morning light, a soft whisper, an unnamed yellow bird perching on a branch”?",
    "explanation": "The text at the bottom of Image B is clearly legible and matches the exact wording provided in the question. It reads: 'A beam of morning light, a soft whisper, an unnamed yellow bird perching on a branch'. There are no discrepancies in spelling, punctuation, or phrasing. The quote is presented in a clean, white serif font with a subtle shadow for readability, and its content aligns perfectly with the given sentence. No variations or errors are observed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the poem placed at the bottom section of the image?",
    "explanation": "The poem is positioned along the lower third of the image, just above the base of the branch and below the bird's tail feathers. It spans horizontally across the image, centered and aligned with the composition. This placement ensures it does not obstruct the main subject (the bird) while still being clearly visible. Given that the bottom section typically refers to the lower portion of the frame, the poem is indeed located in that area, making it a deliberate compositional choice.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the image quality been maintained after adding the poem?",
    "explanation": "The addition of the poem does not degrade the overall image quality. The background remains softly blurred with natural bokeh, the bird’s feathers retain fine detail and vibrant coloration, and the lighting continues to highlight the subject effectively. The text itself is sharp, well-integrated with a slight drop shadow to enhance legibility without distorting the underlying image. There are no signs of pixelation, blurring, or compression artifacts introduced by the text overlay. Therefore, the image quality is preserved despite the edit.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the font style of the poem complementary to the artistic tone of the image?",
    "explanation": "The font used for the poem is a clean, elegant serif typeface with a subtle drop shadow, which enhances readability without overpowering the image. The style evokes a sense of calmness and literary grace, matching the serene and natural atmosphere of the scene—a yellow bird bathed in golden morning light. Serif fonts are often associated with classic, poetic, or contemplative themes, which aligns well with the lyrical content of the quote. Additionally, the white color of the text contrasts gently against the darker green and brown tones of the background, ensuring visibility without disrupting the aesthetic harmony. Thus, the font complements the artistic tone effectively.",
    "answer": "Yes"
