      "question": "Has the baby elephant been transformed into a cartoon character while keeping the original pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baby elephant is clearly depicted as a stylized cartoon character with exaggerated features such as large eyes, soft rounded ears, and a simplified body shape. The character is holding a phone to its ear, mimicking a human-like pose. However, there is no 'original baby elephant' in Image A that can be directly compared for pose similarity—Image A shows a human construction worker on a phone call. Therefore, the concept of 'original pose' must be interpreted based on whether the cartoon elephant replicates the action (phone call) and posture (standing upright, hand to ear) of the person in Image A. While the cartoon elephant adopts a similar action (using a phone), it is not an accurate representation of any real-life animal’s natural pose but rather a creative reinterpretation. Thus, it has been transformed into a cartoon character, and while it retains the general gesture (holding a phone to the ear), it is not a direct transformation of a real baby elephant's pose. Hence, the transformation is stylistic and symbolic, not literal.",

      "question": "Does the cartoon baby elephant exhibit a rounded and cute style with smooth edges and soft features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual elements of the cartoon baby elephant in Image B strongly suggest a design focused on cuteness and appeal. It has large, round eyes, soft pink inner ears, rosy cheeks, and a plump, rounded body with minimal sharp angles. Its trunk is short and curved, and its limbs are stubby and proportionally small. These are all hallmarks of a kawaii or 'cute' aesthetic commonly used in children's media and branding. The smooth shading and lack of harsh lines further emphasize this soft, approachable style. This design choice aligns with common conventions in cartoon design meant to evoke warmth and affection.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, two distinct text elements are visible. Above the elephant’s head, the phrase “First Splash!” is written in a playful, cursive-style font in blue. On the elephant’s belly, the text “Ele-Baby” appears in mixed colors (pink and blue), positioned within the white patch of its torso. Both phrases are clearly legible and integrated into the design. There is no indication that these texts are obscured or missing. Therefore, both texts are present.",

      "question": "Is the text “First Splash!” and “Ele-Baby” placed on a transparent background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is composed of a checkerboard pattern, which is a standard visual indicator used in digital graphics to represent transparency. This pattern is commonly seen in PNG files where the background is removed or made transparent. Since the text and the elephant are superimposed over this checkerboard pattern, it implies that the entire image—including the text—is intended to be placed on a transparent background. This allows the image to be layered over other visuals without a solid background interfering. Therefore, the text is indeed displayed on a transparent background.",

      "question": "Is the pose of the cartoon baby elephant identical to the original baby elephant's pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no 'original baby elephant' in Image A; instead, Image A depicts a human construction worker talking on a phone. The cartoon elephant in Image B is inspired by the human’s pose—specifically, standing upright and holding a phone to the ear—but it is not a transformation of a real baby elephant. The pose of the cartoon elephant is not identical to any biological elephant’s natural stance, nor is there an original baby elephant to compare it to. The pose is anthropomorphic, meaning it mimics human behavior. Therefore, the question is based on a false premise: there is no original baby elephant whose pose could be compared. The cartoon’s pose is derived from the human figure in Image A, not from a real baby elephant.",
