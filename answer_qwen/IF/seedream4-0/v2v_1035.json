      "question": "Has the giraffe been turned into an adorable collection of Russian nesting dolls with a chibi giraffe theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual content shows five wooden nesting dolls arranged on a table. Each doll is painted to resemble a stylized, cartoonish giraffe with large eyes, rosy cheeks, and simplified features characteristic of the 'chibi' art style. The design includes giraffe-like patterns (orange spots on a yellow base) and small ossicones (horn-like structures) on their heads. These dolls are clearly inspired by giraffes but are not real animals; instead, they are artistic representations in the form of traditional Russian matryoshka dolls. Given that the original image (Image A) shows a real giraffe, the transformation from a live animal to a whimsical, themed set of nesting dolls is evident. This change aligns with the concept of turning a realistic animal into a cute, stylized collectible object. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and common knowledge of how such artistic transformations work, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Are there exactly five nesting dolls arranged in descending sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can visually count the number of nesting dolls on the table. Starting from the largest on the left to the smallest on the right, there are five distinct dolls, each progressively smaller than the one before it. This arrangement follows the typical structure of Russian nesting dolls, where each smaller doll fits inside the larger one. The consistent decrease in size and the clear separation between each doll confirm that there are exactly five. There is no ambiguity in their count due to overlapping or occlusion. Thus, based on direct observation and understanding of how nesting dolls are typically presented, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls arranged neatly on a classy wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the five nesting dolls placed in a straight line on a polished wooden table. The table has a rich, dark brown finish with ornate carvings along its edge, suggesting a classic or vintage design. The surface is smooth and reflective, indicating high-quality craftsmanship. The dolls are evenly spaced and aligned, contributing to a neat and orderly presentation. This setting contrasts with the natural environment seen in Image A, where the giraffe stands on grass near rocks. The transition from a wild animal in nature to a curated display on an elegant table reflects a deliberate aesthetic choice. Based on visual cues and general knowledge about furniture design and display practices, the table qualifies as 'classy,' and the arrangement is indeed neat.",

      "question": "Does the edited image have a 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the aspect ratio of Image B, we analyze the proportions of the image frame. The width appears to be approximately 1.5 times the height, which corresponds to a 3:2 ratio. This is a common aspect ratio used in photography and digital imaging, especially for print formats like 6x4 inches. By comparing the visible dimensions—such as the length of the table relative to the vertical space occupied by the background—we can infer that the image is wider than it is tall, but not excessively so. Additionally, the composition fits within a standard rectangular format without distortion. While exact pixel measurements are not available, the visual balance and framing suggest a 3:2 ratio. This is further supported by the fact that many digital cameras and editing platforms default to this ratio. Therefore, based on visual assessment and common image standards, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls maintain a chibi style with large heads, small bodies, and simplified features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each nesting doll exhibits characteristics typical of the chibi art style. The heads are disproportionately large compared to the bodies, with oversized eyes and small mouths, giving them a cute and endearing appearance. The limbs are minimalistic, and facial expressions are simple yet expressive. The overall design avoids anatomical accuracy in favor of exaggerated cuteness, which is a hallmark of chibi aesthetics. Even though these are giraffe-themed dolls, their proportions and features follow the chibi convention rather than realistic animal anatomy. Comparing this to Image A, where the giraffe has a natural body proportion and detailed features, the contrast highlights the intentional stylization in Image B. Thus, combining visual analysis with knowledge of chibi art conventions confirms that the dolls do maintain this style.",
