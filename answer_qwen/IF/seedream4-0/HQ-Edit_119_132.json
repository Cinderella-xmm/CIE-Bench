      "question": "Is the husky depicted as a plush toy rather than a live animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the husky has characteristics typical of a stuffed animal: uniform stitching lines visible along the body, particularly on the chest and legs, and a slightly rigid posture that lacks the natural flexibility of a living animal. The fur appears to be made of soft fabric with a consistent texture, lacking the variation and depth seen in real fur. Additionally, the eyes are overly bright and uniformly blue, resembling plastic or embroidered features common in plush toys. These visual cues, combined with world knowledge about plush toys—such as their construction from sewn fabrics and synthetic materials—indicate that this is not a live animal but a manufactured toy.",

      "question": "Do the husky's paws appear significantly larger and more exaggerated than those of a real husky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The paws in Image B are proportionally large relative to the body, especially when compared to anatomical proportions of real huskies. They are rounded, padded, and have clearly defined toes that appear oversized and stylized. This exaggeration is common in plush toys to enhance cuteness and appeal, often at the expense of realistic proportions. In contrast, real huskies have paws that are functional and proportionate to their body size. Based on visual analysis and general knowledge of toy design principles, these paws are indeed exaggerated.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the fur texture been replaced with a soft, velvety fabric appearance throughout the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the husky in Image B shows a uniform, smooth texture consistent with plush fabric rather than natural fur. There are no individual hair strands or variations in density, which would be present in a real animal’s coat. Instead, the texture appears soft and velvety, typical of high-quality plush materials used in stuffed animals. This is further supported by the lack of natural sheen or shadowing that would occur with real fur under lighting. Therefore, the fur has been replaced with a synthetic, fabric-like material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial features, particularly the eyes, rendered as embroidered details rather than realistic ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes in Image B are bright blue and perfectly round, with a glossy finish that suggests they are made of plastic or painted fabric, not biological tissue. While there is no clear evidence of embroidery (such as visible thread patterns), the overall look of the face—including the stitched mouth and symmetrical markings—aligns with typical plush toy construction. However, the eyes themselves appear to be molded or glued-on elements rather than embroidered. Embroidered eyes usually show visible stitch lines or texture, which are absent here. Thus, the eyes are not embroidered but likely plastic inserts.",

      "question": "Is the plush toy placed on a clean wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the plush toy rests on a flat, light-colored wooden surface with visible grain and edges consistent with a shelf. The surface is uncluttered and clean, with no dust, objects, or debris nearby. The background is plain and neutral, suggesting an indoor setting designed for product display. Given the simplicity and cleanliness of the setup, it matches the description of a clean wooden shelf commonly used for showcasing items like plush toys.",

      "question": "Is the background minimalist, without any natural elements like snow, trees, or sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a plain, off-white wall with no visible natural elements such as snow, trees, or sky. Unlike Image A, which depicts a snowy forest scene, Image B has a completely artificial and controlled environment. This minimalist backdrop is typical for product photography, where the focus is on the object itself without distractions. Therefore, the background is indeed minimalist and free of natural scenery.",
