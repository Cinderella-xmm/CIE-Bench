      "question": "Have the clothing patterns been replaced with southwestern fabrics such as denim or woven textile designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both individuals are wearing jackets that feature distinct woven textile patterns on the shoulders and sleeves. These patterns include geometric and tribal motifs typical of Southwestern or Native American-inspired designs. The man on the left wears a white jacket over a denim shirt, while the man on the right wears a light blue denim jacket with similar patterned accents. Denim is a common fabric in Western fashion, and the inclusion of these intricate woven designs aligns with Southwestern aesthetics. This contrasts with the original image (Image A), where the clothing appears more casual and lacks such detailed patterns. Therefore, the clothing has indeed been updated to incorporate Southwestern textile elements.",

      "question": "Are cacti silhouettes and a setting sun incorporated into the wooden background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a stylized desert scene above the wooden paneling. There are clear black silhouettes of cacti on the left and right sides, and a large orange setting sun with horizontal stripes on the right side of the image. These elements are not present in Image A, which shows only the plain wooden backdrop with 'FGL HOUSE' text. The addition of these desert-themed graphics enhances the Western aesthetic and suggests a narrative of a sunset in the Southwest. Thus, the visual cues confirm the presence of both cacti silhouettes and a setting sun.",

      "question": "Has the band name been displayed in a handmade, distressed font style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of Image B, the text 'FLORIDA GEORGIA LINE' is displayed in a bold, uppercase font with a textured, worn appearance. The letters have irregular edges and a slightly uneven look, consistent with a distressed or handmade style commonly used in vintage or rustic branding. This contrasts with Image A, where the text 'FLORIDA GEORGIA LINE: RISE TO THE TOP' is in a clean, modern sans-serif font without any distress effects. The choice of font in Image B supports the overall vintage Western theme, making it visually aligned with the aesthetic of aged materials and handcrafted design.",

      "question": "Have additional western-themed elements such as cowboy boots or other accessories been added to the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes two brown cowboy boots with ornate stitching placed at the bottom corners—one on each side—flanking the band members. Additionally, a second cowboy hat is positioned near the right individual's shoulder, further reinforcing the Western motif. These elements are absent in Image A, where no such accessories are visible. The inclusion of cowboy boots and an extra hat adds symbolic depth to the image, emphasizing the country and Western identity of the band. Therefore, these thematic accessories have clearly been added.",

      "question": "Has the image been transformed into a collage-style layout with layered or composite visual elements suggesting a narrative?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a layered composition that combines multiple visual elements: the photograph of the band members, the illustrated desert background with cacti and a sunset, the wooden paneling with repeated logos, the cowboy boots and hat, and the stylized banner with the band name. These components are arranged in a way that suggests a curated, composite design rather than a single photographic capture. This layering creates a narrative of a Western lifestyle and musical identity, typical of promotional artwork. In contrast, Image A is a straightforward photograph with minimal graphic elements. Thus, Image B functions as a collage-style layout with intentional visual storytelling.",

      "question": "Does the overall layout maintain a cohesive vintage western theme and appear visually inviting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire composition of Image B adheres to a consistent vintage Western theme through its use of warm colors (orange, brown, beige), retro-style illustrations (cacti, sunset), Western attire (cowboy hats, boots, denim), and distressed typography. The combination of photographic realism with illustrative elements creates a nostalgic yet vibrant atmosphere. The arrangement is balanced, with symmetrical placement of boots and hats, and the central positioning of the band members draws attention. Compared to Image A, which is more neutral and modern, Image B’s design choices enhance visual appeal and thematic coherence. As a result, the layout is both thematically cohesive and aesthetically engaging.",
