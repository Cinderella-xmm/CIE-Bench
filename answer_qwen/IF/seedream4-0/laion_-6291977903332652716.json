      "question": "Is the entire canal scene enclosed within a transparent spherical boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large transparent glass sphere is prominently featured in the foreground, held by a hand. The sphere contains a miniature version of the canal scene, including the buildings, water, and bridge. The reflection and refraction effects visible on the sphere's surface confirm that it is a physical object with optical properties. The scene inside the sphere appears distorted due to the curvature, which is consistent with how light behaves when passing through a spherical lens. This indicates that the canal scene is not physically present in its original form but is instead contained within the sphere. Therefore, the entire canal scene depicted inside the sphere is enclosed within a transparent spherical boundary.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the timber-framed houses rendered with enhanced texture detail and colored in muted autumnal tones (e.g., browns, oranges, soft reds)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The timber-framed houses in Image B appear visually similar to those in the original image, but with subtle differences. The wood framing is more pronounced, suggesting enhanced texture detail. The color palette includes warm browns, terracotta, and soft reds, particularly noticeable in the roof tiles and wooden beams, aligning with autumnal tones. Additionally, some foliage around the buildings shows yellow and orange hues, reinforcing the autumnal theme. These visual cues suggest a deliberate artistic enhancement to evoke an autumn atmosphere, likely achieved through digital editing or post-processing techniques.",

      "question": "Does the canal water appear glossy and reflective, resembling a polished resin surface rather than natural water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water in the canal within the glass sphere exhibits a highly reflective and smooth surface, with sharp reflections of the surrounding buildings and sky. However, the clarity and uniformity of the reflections, along with the lack of ripples or natural movement, suggest an artificial appearance. The water inside the sphere has a slightly amber tint, especially near the bottom, which is inconsistent with natural canal water. This effect, combined with the stillness and mirror-like quality, strongly resembles a polished resin or liquid-filled model rather than real flowing water. This suggests the water is stylized for aesthetic purposes, mimicking a miniature diorama.",

      "question": "Are there scaled-down, detailed mini bridges and additional greenery (such as small plants or moss) integrated into the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the glass sphere, the bridge over the canal appears smaller and more detailed than in the original scene, consistent with a miniature representation. It features fine architectural elements like railings and supports, indicating high detail typical of scale models. Additionally, small plants and moss-like textures are visible along the edges of the canal and on the stone embankments, particularly near the base of the sphere. These details are not present in the original image and appear to be added to enhance the realism of the miniature scene. This suggests the inclusion of scaled-down structures and extra greenery to create a more intricate and lifelike diorama.",

      "question": "Are there small, stylized human figures in vibrant clothing positioned along the walkways, appearing as hand-sculpted models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On both sides of the canal, near the walkways, there are several small human figures. These figures are disproportionately small compared to the buildings and have exaggerated proportions and bright, colorful clothing (e.g., red, blue, yellow). Their appearance is consistent with hand-sculpted or painted figurines commonly used in model scenes or dioramas. They are not realistic depictions of people but rather stylized representations, likely added to enhance the whimsical, miniature aesthetic of the scene. This style is typical of decorative models, such as those found in snow globes or museum displays.",
