      "question": "Is the knight and castle contained within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene—including the knight, castle, sheep, and dragon—is enclosed within a clear, curved structure that resembles a glass dome. This is evident from the visible reflections on the surface, the rounded edges of the enclosure, and the way light interacts with the transparent material. The base of the dome is black and circular, supporting the idea that it is a display case or terrarium-like object. Based on these visual cues and common knowledge of such objects (like dioramas or collectible displays), the scene is clearly contained within a transparent glass dome.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the knight been transformed into a chibi-style figure with exaggerated proportions (e.g., large head, small body)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knight in Image B exhibits characteristics typical of chibi art style: a disproportionately large head relative to the body, simplified facial features (large eyes, small mouth), and a stylized, cartoonish appearance. These traits contrast sharply with realistic human proportions. Chibi figures are commonly used in anime and collectible figurines to create a cute, whimsical aesthetic. Given these visual indicators, the knight has indeed been stylized into a chibi form.",

      "question": "Is the knight holding a shield made of polished metal with visible reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shield held by the knight in Image B is highly reflective, showing bright highlights and mirror-like qualities consistent with polished metal. The surface captures light and reflects parts of the surrounding environment, such as the sky and nearby structures, which is characteristic of a metallic, polished finish. This contrasts with matte or non-reflective materials. Therefore, based on the visual evidence of reflection and shine, the shield appears to be made of polished metal.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image earthy and muted (e.g., browns, grays, soft greens), consistent with a medieval atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B includes warm browns from the stone castle and ground, muted grays from the knight’s armor and tower, soft greens from the grass and hanging vines, and golden hues from the sunset sky. These colors collectively evoke a natural, historical, and medieval ambiance. Earthy tones are commonly associated with ancient settings, and their presence here reinforces a sense of timelessness and fantasy realism. Thus, the dominant colors align with a medieval atmosphere.",

      "question": "Are there small groups of sheep visible grazing near the knight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple sheep are clearly visible around the base of the dome, scattered across the grassy terrain near the knight. They appear to be grazing, with some facing different directions, suggesting movement and natural behavior. Their presence adds to the pastoral and peaceful tone of the scene. Based on visual confirmation, several sheep are indeed present and positioned close to the knight.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a dragon visible, curled around a turret, and appearing to be asleep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A dragon is visible in Image B, perched atop a stone turret of the castle. It is coiled in a relaxed posture, with its head resting near its body, indicating a state of rest or sleep. Its scales are detailed and dark, contrasting with the lighter stone of the castle. The positioning and body language suggest dormancy rather than alertness. This aligns with the depiction of dragons in fantasy lore as powerful yet sometimes dormant creatures. Therefore, the dragon is present, curled around the turret, and appears to be asleep.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the overall scene within the dome suggest a whimsical, imaginative narrative (e.g., peaceful coexistence of knight, dragon, and animals)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B combines elements typically seen as opposing—such as a knight and a dragon—into a harmonious setting. The knight stands calmly, the dragon rests peacefully, and sheep graze freely, all within a glass dome that suggests a preserved, fantastical world. This juxtaposition of mythical beings and animals in a serene, almost toy-like environment evokes a sense of fantasy and playfulness. The use of a chibi-style character further enhances the whimsical tone. Together, these elements create an imaginative narrative where danger and peace coexist, typical of fairy tales or collectible dioramas. Hence, the scene strongly suggests a whimsical, imaginative story.",
