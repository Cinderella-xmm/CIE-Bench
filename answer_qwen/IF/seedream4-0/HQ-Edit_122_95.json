      "question": "Is the entire image rendered in a mosaic style composed of small, colored tesserae?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the visual texture throughout the image—especially in the figures, their clothing, and the background—is clearly composed of small, square-shaped elements that resemble tesserae, the individual pieces used in mosaic art. These elements are arranged to form larger images, such as the faces, sarees, and architectural details. The overall appearance mimics traditional mosaic techniques, particularly those seen in Byzantine or religious mosaics, where gold leaf and colored stones are used to create luminous, detailed scenes. The uniformity of the pixelated grid-like structure across all surfaces, including skin, fabric, and buildings, supports the conclusion that the entire image is rendered in a mosaic style. This is further reinforced by the use of gold as a dominant background color, which is typical in religious mosaics.",

      "question": "Are the sarees decorated with intricate peacock and vine patterns made from mosaic tesserae?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sarees are richly adorned with decorative patterns. Upon close inspection, these patterns include stylized floral motifs and shapes resembling peacock feathers, particularly visible in the lower sections of the sarees and along the borders. These designs are constructed using the same small, colored tesserae that compose the rest of the image, indicating they are part of the mosaic technique. The use of blue, green, and red tesserae in concentric circles and feather-like arrangements strongly suggests peacock imagery, a common motif in Indian art. Additionally, vine-like patterns interweave through the design, consistent with traditional textile ornamentation. Since the entire image is in mosaic form, these patterns are inherently created from tesserae.",

      "question": "Has the Taj Mahal been replaced with a domed basilica featuring arches that lead into scenes depicting mythological figures or narratives?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural structure in the background retains the general silhouette of the Taj Mahal, including its central dome and minarets. However, it is rendered in mosaic style and integrated into a larger artistic composition that includes additional symbolic elements. To the left of the Taj Mahal, there is an arched structure leading into a scene featuring mythological or religious figures, such as a winged bull (resembling a chimera or Assyrian lamassu) and human figures in classical attire. These figures appear to be part of a narrative panel, reminiscent of ancient or religious iconography. While the Taj Mahal itself has not been completely replaced, it is now embedded within a broader mosaic tableau that includes adjacent architectural and mythological scenes, suggesting a fusion of Indian and classical/Byzantine themes. Therefore, while the Taj Mahal remains identifiable, it is contextualized within a transformed environment that includes basilica-like arches and mythological narratives.",

      "question": "Are the figures posed in a solemn, upright ecclesiastical stance with hands folded or held in a reverent manner, consistent with Byzantine religious icons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The two figures in Image B stand upright with their hands gently clasped in front of them, a posture commonly associated with reverence and piety in religious iconography. Their facial expressions are serene and composed, lacking any dynamic movement, which aligns with the static, contemplative nature of Byzantine icons. The positioning of the hands—folded near the waist and slightly inward—mirrors the gestures seen in Christian religious mosaics, where saints or divine figures are depicted in prayerful or meditative poses. Furthermore, the presence of halos around their heads (constructed from mosaic tesserae) reinforces the religious or sacred context. This combination of posture, expression, and symbolic elements strongly supports the interpretation that the figures are rendered in a style consistent with Byzantine ecclesiastical iconography.",

      "question": "Are floral motifs visibly present throughout the image as part of the mosaic design, appearing on the sarees, background, or architecture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Floral motifs are indeed prominent in Image B. On the sarees, intricate flower patterns—such as roses and lotus-like blooms—are woven into the mosaic design using colored tesserae. In the background, especially on the left side, there are large floral arrangements, including red and white roses with green leaves, rendered in the same mosaic style. These flowers extend into the lower-left corner and also appear near the top-right, where a vine with blossoms ascends alongside the figure's halo. The architecture, though stylized, incorporates floral elements in its decorative borders. The consistent use of floral patterns across multiple layers of the image—clothing, background, and embellishments—confirms that floral motifs are a key component of the mosaic design.",

      "question": "Is the background composed primarily of golden mosaic tiles, creating a radiant golden backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is overwhelmingly dominated by a golden hue, achieved through the use of small, reflective mosaic tiles. These tiles are uniformly distributed across the sky, ground, and surrounding areas, forming a radiant, luminous field that enhances the sacred and divine atmosphere of the scene. The golden mosaic serves as a unifying element, contrasting with the more colorful tesserae used for the figures and architectural details. This technique is characteristic of Byzantine mosaics, where gold backgrounds symbolize divinity and eternal light. The consistent texture and color across the background confirm that it is composed primarily of golden mosaic tiles.",
