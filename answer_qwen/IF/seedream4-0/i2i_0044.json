      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show bold, visible brushstrokes and exaggerated color contrasts, especially on the bread, lettuce, and cheese. The edges are outlined with strong lines, and the colors are saturated and stylized rather than realistic. This artistic approach mimics a thick-painted or impressionistic cartoon style, where forms are simplified and textures are emphasized through expressive strokes. This is consistent with digital art styles that simulate oil painting or cartoon rendering, which often use such techniques to convey vibrancy and visual appeal. Based on these observations, it is clear that the image uses a stylized, thick-painted aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are the layers of the sandwich cross-section clearly emphasized with distinct textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich layers—such as the bread, lettuce, cheese, and meat—are rendered with varying shades and stroke patterns that suggest texture. The bread has a porous surface indicated by lighter and darker patches, while the cheese appears smooth and yellow with defined edges. The lettuce has ruffled green shapes with highlights, and the meat layer shows darker tones with some depth. These elements are visually separated and textured differently, giving the impression of distinct layers. Although not photorealistic, the stylization still emphasizes the cross-sectional structure through contrast and form. Therefore, the layers are clearly emphasized with stylized textures.",

      "question": "Has the lettuce been simplified into smeared green shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lettuce is not depicted as simple smears but rather as leafy, layered green shapes with defined edges and folds. While the style is abstracted, the leaves retain their general form and volume, resembling real lettuce rather than being reduced to mere blobs or smears. The green hues vary in tone and are applied with brushstroke-like effects, suggesting texture and dimensionality. This indicates a stylized but recognizable representation, not a simplification into smeared shapes. Hence, the lettuce has not been reduced to smears.",

      "question": "Are there sauce decorations added around the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features decorative streaks of red and green on the white plate, positioned near the sandwich. These appear as stylized drizzles, resembling ketchup or hot sauce (red) and possibly pesto or herb oil (green). They are not present in the original photo (Image A), indicating they were added during editing for visual flair. Such garnishes are common in stylized food illustrations to enhance presentation and mimic gourmet plating. Their presence confirms that sauce decorations have been artistically added to the plate.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Modern Western restaurant menus often feature vibrant, stylized food imagery that balances realism with artistic flair to make dishes look appealing and upscale. Image B’s thick-painted, cartoonish style—with bold colors, dramatic lighting, and decorative sauce drizzles—aligns well with contemporary trends in food illustration used in marketing and menus. This style evokes a sense of freshness, creativity, and gourmet quality, even if not photorealistic. It is commonly seen in cafes, bistros, and casual fine dining establishments aiming for a trendy, inviting look. Thus, the image fits the aesthetic typical of modern Western restaurant visuals.",
