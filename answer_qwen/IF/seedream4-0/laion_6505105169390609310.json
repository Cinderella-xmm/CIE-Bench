      "question": "Is the scene enclosed within a transparent glass snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three figurines are positioned inside a circular, transparent enclosure that is framed by a wooden border. The presence of a clear dome-like structure above the figures, along with visible snowflakes and a star suspended from the top, strongly suggests that this is a snow globe. The reflective and transparent nature of the dome, combined with the internal elements like falling snowflakes (even if static), indicates it is designed to resemble a snow globe. This is consistent with common snow globe designs where a scene is encased in glass or acrylic.",

      "question": "Are the figurines standing on a grassy hilltop surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the snow globe in Image B, the base beneath the figurines appears to be textured and green, resembling grass. There are also small white specks scattered across the surface that mimic snow, reinforcing the impression of a natural, outdoor setting. The elevated, rounded shape of the base further supports the idea of a hilltop. This visual detail aligns with typical representations of nativity scenes placed on grassy mounds, especially in decorative items like snow globes.",

      "question": "Is there a tiny golden star suspended above the figurines inside the globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Above the figurines, within the transparent dome of the snow globe, a small golden star is clearly visible hanging from a thin chain or wire. Its placement at the top center of the globe and its metallic sheen indicate it is a decorative element meant to represent the Star of Bethlehem. This is a common feature in religious-themed snow globes, symbolizing the guiding star in the Nativity story.",

      "question": "Are there gentle, swirling snowflakes visible inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the snow globe, numerous small white snowflake patterns are visible against the background. While they appear static in the image, their distribution and design suggest they are intended to represent falling snowflakes, a hallmark of snow globes. The swirling motion is implied by the arrangement and style of the snowflakes, even though no actual movement can be observed in a still image. In context, such snowflakes are typically present in snow globes to create a winter atmosphere.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe is mounted on a dark brown wooden base that features intricate carvings and floral patterns along its edges. At the bottom center of the base, the words 'Peace and Hope' are clearly inscribed in raised lettering. This combination of ornate woodwork and meaningful text is characteristic of decorative holiday items, particularly those with religious or seasonal themes. The craftsmanship and inscription align with traditional designs for Christmas decor.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurines are dressed in robes with vibrant and contrasting colorsâ€”deep red, royal blue, green, purple, and gold accents. These rich tones are typical of traditional depictions of the Three Wise Men and are often used in festive decorations to convey grandeur and celebration. The use of gold trim and elaborate clothing enhances the sense of occasion, making the scene visually striking and appropriate for a holiday display.",
