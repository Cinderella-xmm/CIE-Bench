      "question": "Is the tall building replaced with a towering automaton featuring a sleek, white, armored body and mechanical windows as apertures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original tall building that was visible in the background of Image A has been replaced by a massive humanoid automaton. This automaton is predominantly white, with a sleek, armored design resembling advanced robotics. Its chest area features glowing blue panels that resemble mechanical 'windows' or display units, consistent with futuristic machinery. The automaton's head includes sensor-like eyes and an angular structure, reinforcing its robotic nature. Given the visual evidence—its size, position, and design—it clearly replaces the previously existing skyscraper. This transformation aligns with a cyberpunk or sci-fi aesthetic, where traditional urban elements are reimagined through technology.",

      "question": "Has the traditional Japanese roof been converted into stylized shoulder pads with embedded intricate patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The traditional Japanese-style roof of the building in Image B appears to have been modified. Instead of a standard tiled roof, it now features large, symmetrical structures on either side that resemble shoulder pads, likely part of the automaton's design. These 'shoulder pads' contain circular, ornate patterns that glow faintly, suggesting embedded circuitry or decorative motifs typical of futuristic designs. This transformation turns architectural elements into parts of a robotic suit, blending traditional form with high-tech aesthetics. In contrast, Image A shows a normal tiled roof without such modifications. The change indicates a deliberate artistic fusion of architecture and robotics.",

      "question": "Are all traffic signs replaced with holographic symbols that appear to float or emit light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the traffic signs visible in the scene—such as the stop sign and pedestrian crossing sign—are not fully replaced by holograms. While the red triangular stop sign has been altered to include glowing neon-like accents and a futuristic emblem, it remains a physical object rather than a floating hologram. The blue pedestrian crossing sign and directional arrow remain unchanged in form and placement, lacking any visible holographic properties. Therefore, although some signs have been enhanced with digital effects, they are not entirely replaced by floating or emitting holographic symbols. This suggests selective augmentation rather than full replacement.",

      "question": "Are the pedestrians in the street replaced with robotic figures featuring geometric designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two human pedestrians from Image A have been replaced by small, humanoid robotic figures. These robots feature angular, geometric designs with reflective surfaces and glowing blue accents, particularly around joints and limbs. Their forms are distinctly artificial and stylized, contrasting sharply with the organic appearance of humans. The robots are positioned similarly to the original pedestrians but are clearly non-human, indicating a complete substitution. This reflects a theme of automation and futurism, where everyday life is populated by synthetic beings.",

      "question": "Has the streetscape been altered to include robotic elements and geometric designs consistent with a futuristic urban environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a transformed streetscape that integrates numerous robotic and geometric elements. The central building is now part of a giant robot, with glowing panels, mechanical joints, and stylized shoulder pads. Smaller robots populate the street, and the lighting emphasizes sharp lines and illuminated circuits. Even the signage has been augmented with neon effects. Compared to Image A, which depicts a realistic urban scene with traditional and modern buildings, Image B introduces a cohesive cyberpunk aesthetic. The integration of technology into architecture and public space creates a futuristic urban environment, consistent with speculative fiction themes.",
