      "question": "Is the background showing an African savanna scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a vast, open landscape with dry, golden grasslands, scattered acacia-like trees, and reddish-brown soil, which are characteristic features of an African savanna. The terrain is flat and expansive, typical of regions such as the Serengeti or Kalahari. These visual cues align with common representations of African savannas in both photography and media. The presence of sparse vegetation and distinct tree shapes further supports this identification. Therefore, based on these visual elements and world knowledge about African ecosystems, it is reasonable to conclude that the background depicts an African savanna.",

      "question": "Is the image set against a dark, night-time sky indicative of nighttime?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is dark blue and filled with stars, including a prominent band of light resembling the Milky Way. This type of celestial display is only visible during nighttime, particularly under clear, dark skies away from urban light pollution. The absence of daylight indicators such as sunlight, shadows consistent with daytime, or a visible sun or horizon glow confirms that the scene is set at night. The visibility of stars and the Milky Way further reinforces that this is a nighttime setting. Thus, based on astronomical and environmental knowledge, the sky indicates nighttime.",

      "question": "Is the Milky Way clearly visible in the sky above the savanna?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bright, diffuse band of stars stretches across the sky, forming a luminous arc that is consistent with the appearance of the Milky Way galaxy. This structure is characterized by its dense concentration of stars and nebulous clouds, which are typical features of the Milky Way when viewed from Earth under ideal conditions. The clarity and prominence of this feature suggest it was captured with long-exposure photography techniques often used in astrophotography. Given that the Milky Way is visible and well-defined, especially in contrast to the surrounding starfield, it can be confidently stated that the Milky Way is clearly visible.",

      "question": "Are multiple stars visible alongside the Milky Way in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is densely populated with numerous individual points of light, which are identifiable as stars. These stars vary in brightness and are scattered across the entire sky, including areas outside the Milky Way's central band. The high number of visible stars, along with their distribution, indicates that the image captures a wide field of view under low-light conditions conducive to star visibility. Such detail is typical of astrophotography taken in remote, dark locations. Therefore, multiple stars are indeed visible alongside the Milky Way.",

      "question": "Do the train and railway tracks appear seamlessly integrated into the savanna background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "While the train and railway tracks are visually coherent within the scene, there are subtle inconsistencies suggesting they may not be fully seamless. For instance, the lighting on the train appears somewhat mismatched with the ambient light of the night sky—railway tracks and trains typically cast more defined shadows under direct moonlight or artificial lighting, but here the shadows are soft and inconsistent with natural night illumination. Additionally, the transition between the train’s metallic surface and the surrounding environment lacks realistic texture blending. Furthermore, the placement of the signal post and track geometry does not perfectly align with natural topography or typical rail construction in such remote areas. These discrepancies suggest digital manipulation or compositing, indicating that while the elements are placed together, they are not seamlessly integrated. Comparing with Image A, where the train is in a daytime, forested railway setting, the context in Image B is entirely different, reinforcing the idea of a composite image. Thus, despite visual plausibility, the integration is not fully seamless.",
