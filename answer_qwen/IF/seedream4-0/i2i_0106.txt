    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image show the character in a chibi style?",
    "explanation": "The character in Image B exhibits exaggerated proportions typical of chibi art style, such as a large head relative to the body, simplified facial features, and a small, stylized form. The eyes are large and round, the limbs are short and stubby, and the overall design is cartoonish and cute, which aligns with the chibi aesthetic commonly used in collectible figurines. This style is intentionally designed to be endearing and playful while still recognizable as the original character. Based on these visual cues and common knowledge of chibi art conventions, it is clear that the figure is rendered in a chibi style.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the character depicted in soft vinyl figurine form, with suitable adjustments for a desk toy?",
    "explanation": "The figure in Image B has a smooth, rounded surface texture and a matte finish consistent with soft vinyl materials often used in collectible figurines like Funko Pop! or similar brands. Its proportions are compact and balanced, making it ideal for display on a desk without tipping over. Additionally, the pose is stable and the limbs are articulated enough to suggest it's designed for static display rather than action play. These characteristics—material appearance, size, and design—are typical of soft vinyl desk toys intended for fans. Therefore, based on visual analysis and general knowledge of such products, the figure appears to be a soft vinyl figurine suitable for desk display.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the character positioned on a small base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure stands firmly on a flat, circular platform that supports its weight. This platform is clearly part of the figurine’s structure and serves as a base to prevent it from toppling over. The base is relatively small compared to the figure but sufficient for stability, which is standard for desktop collectibles. Given the context of collectible figures, such bases are commonly included to ensure proper display. The visual evidence confirms the presence of a small base beneath the character.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the base include the label “I AM IRONMAN”?",
    "explanation": "The base of the figurine in Image B has visible text engraved or printed on its front face. Upon close inspection, the words 'I AM IRONMAN' are clearly legible in capital letters, matching the iconic phrase associated with the Iron Man character. This phrase is a well-known quote from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is frequently used in merchandise. The font and placement are consistent with branding seen on official collectibles. Therefore, based on direct visual observation and cultural recognition of the phrase, the base does indeed feature this label.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the primary Iron Man features (such as the arc reactor) discernible on the chibi figure?",
    "explanation": "Despite the chibi style, key elements of Iron Man's design are preserved in Image B. The chest features a glowing blue circle representing the arc reactor, which is central to Iron Man's identity and power source. Similarly, the repulsor in the palm of the raised hand emits a bright blue light, indicating functionality and alignment with the character's signature technology. The red and gold color scheme, along with the armored suit design, remains recognizable. While simplified, these core features are clearly identifiable, demonstrating that the essential aspects of Iron Man have been maintained even in a stylized format. This reflects both artistic interpretation and adherence to character design principles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
