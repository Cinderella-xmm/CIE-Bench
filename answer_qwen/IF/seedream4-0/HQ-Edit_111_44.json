      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the background in Image B, the individuals are engaged in typical market activities—selling goods, conversing, or handling produce. None of them are shown bowing, kneeling, or performing any gesture of reverence toward the central figure. Their postures are casual and focused on trade, not on paying homage. While the central figure is prominent, there is no visual indication of ritualistic respect or submission from others. This contrasts with depictions of royalty where subjects often show deference, but here, the scene maintains a communal market atmosphere without hierarchical gestures.",

      ],

These colors are reflected in the buildings, clothing, and market goods, creating a cohesive, sun-drenched atmosphere. The lighting appears soft and diffused, resembling natural daylight filtered through canopy coverings, which enhances the warmth of the scene. There are minimal cool or blue hues; even shadows retain warm undertones. This aligns with the aesthetic of desert or Mediterranean markets under a bright sky, where warm earth tones are prevalent.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The baskets and containers in Image B feature subtle decorative patterns, particularly on their rims and surfaces. Some of these patterns resemble ancient scripts or symbolic carvings, possibly inspired by Egyptian hieroglyphs or African tribal art. These motifs are integrated into the design of the vessels, suggesting cultural significance. Additionally, the overall arrangement and style of the goods reflect traditional craftsmanship, reinforcing the idea that they carry cultural or historical symbolism.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central figure occupies the foreground and is placed near the center of the frame, drawing immediate attention due to her size, elaborate attire, and positioning. She is larger than surrounding figures and stands out against the busy market background. The composition uses depth and focus to emphasize her importance, with the market receding behind her. Her placement and visual prominence confirm that she is the primary subject of the image, consistent with artistic techniques used to highlight key figures in narrative or symbolic scenes.",
