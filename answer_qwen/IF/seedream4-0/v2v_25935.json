      "question": "Is the entire urban street scene recreated using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements such as the buildings, cobblestone path, greenery, and even the man himself are constructed with a blocky, modular appearance characteristic of Lego bricks. The textures on the walls, windows, doors, and ground show distinct Lego stud patterns and color segmentation typical of Lego construction. The consistent use of uniform shapes, interlocking structures, and bright, solid colors further supports the conclusion that this is a fully realized Lego recreation. The environment appears to be a scaled-down, stylized version of an urban street, entirely built from Lego components. This conclusion aligns with world knowledge about Lego sets, which often recreate real-world scenes in miniature form using standardized bricks.",

      "question": "Are the cobblestones on the path represented using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cobblestones in Image B are clearly composed of individual grey and light-grey circular and rectangular pieces arranged in a pattern that mimics real cobblestone pavement. These pieces have a raised, round-topped surface resembling Lego studs, which are standard features of Lego tiles used for flooring or road surfaces. The uniformity, repetitive pattern, and slight elevation of each piece confirm they are Lego elements designed to represent cobblestones. In contrast, real cobblestones would have irregular shapes and natural wear, which are absent here. Based on visual cues and knowledge of Lego building techniques, these are indeed Lego bricks.",

      "question": "Are the buildings in the background recreated using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buildings in the background of Image B exhibit characteristics typical of Lego architecture: stacked rectangular blocks with visible stud patterns, flat surfaces, and modular window placements. The brickwork on the façades shows consistent horizontal layering, and the arches and doorways are formed using curved and angled Lego pieces. The colors (beige, yellow, red) are common in Lego city sets, and the overall aesthetic is highly stylized and geometric—hallmarks of Lego constructions. Real buildings would have smoother surfaces, varied textures, and more organic architectural details, none of which are present here. Thus, based on visual evidence and understanding of Lego design principles, the buildings are made of Lego bricks.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is unmistakably a Lego minifigure, identifiable by its iconic yellow head, black torso, and articulated limbs. The clothing—blue jacket, black pants, and black cap—is made from standard Lego accessories, including printed or colored torso pieces and hat elements. The brown bag has a simple, blocky shape with visible seams and buckles made from Lego parts, consistent with Lego accessory designs. The proportions, joint articulation, and material texture all align with known Lego minifigure construction. Unlike a real person, this figure lacks facial features, realistic skin tone, or detailed fabric texture—further confirming it is constructed from Lego bricks.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the original composition and perspective of the urban street scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, both images share the same general composition: a person walking away down a narrow, cobblestone street flanked by buildings, with a vanishing point perspective leading into the distance. The relative positioning of the subject in the center, the alignment of the buildings, and the depth created by the converging lines of the street are preserved. However, while the layout and perspective are maintained, the medium has changed—from a realistic photograph to a stylized Lego recreation. The spatial relationships, angles, and framing remain consistent, indicating that the editor retained the original composition and perspective but transformed the content into a Lego representation. Therefore, despite the change in material, the structural composition and viewpoint are preserved.",
