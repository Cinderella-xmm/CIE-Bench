      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The art piece in Image B consists of a display case with a LEGO minifigure and a dragon figurine inside. The entire structure, including the glass enclosure and its base, is positioned upright on a flat surface. The orientation of the object is clearly vertical, as it stands tall with its height exceeding its width. This is evident from the way the light interacts with the transparent glass and how the base supports the structure from below. In real-world display cases, such enclosures are typically mounted vertically to allow for optimal viewing and stability. Therefore, based on visual cues and common design practices for display cases, the art piece is oriented vertically.",

      "question": "Is there a Classic LEGO minifigure positioned at the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, a LEGO minifigure is visible inside the glass display case. However, it is not centered horizontally within the frame. Instead, it is positioned slightly to the left of the center, with the red and gold dragon figure occupying more central space. The minifigure is identifiable by its characteristic features: a yellow head, printed facial expression, and articulated limbs typical of LEGO figures. While it is a classic-style LEGO minifigure (with a torso featuring a patterned shirt), it is not located at the exact center of the image. The composition places emphasis on the dragon, which is larger and more centrally aligned. Thus, despite being a classic LEGO minifigure, it is not positioned at the center of the image.",

      "question": "Does the animal in the image incorporate warm colors and textures from the photo and merge surreal and mythical design elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The animal in Image B is a stylized dragon figure, predominantly red with golden accents, including horns, scales, and decorative patterns along its body. These warm tones—red, orange, and gold—are consistent with the overall color palette of the image, which includes an amber-to-cream gradient background. The texture appears glossy and smooth, suggesting a plastic or resin material, but the design incorporates mythical elements such as elongated horns, a serpentine body, and ornamental markings that evoke traditional East Asian dragon imagery. These features are not found in real animals, indicating a fusion of fantasy and artistic interpretation. The combination of realistic textures with fantastical anatomy reflects a surreal and mythical design approach. Therefore, the animal does incorporate warm colors and textures while merging surreal and mythical elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a rectangular, transparent glass enclosure housing the LEGO minifigure and dragon. The glass panels are clear and seamless, forming a cube-like structure with clean edges and no visible ornamentation. The interior contains only two objects—the minifigure and the dragon—placed on a black base with studs, which suggests a functional yet uncluttered design. There are no additional props, lighting effects, or decorations inside the case, reinforcing a minimalist aesthetic. The exterior base is black with metallic feet, adding to the modern and refined appearance. Given that the glass is transparent and the internal arrangement is sparse and intentional, the scene is indeed enclosed within a transparent glass cube with a sleek and minimalist interior layout.",

      "question": "Does the background feature a gradient that transitions from deep amber to soft cream tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B displays a smooth color transition. At the top, the hue is a rich, deep amber, which gradually lightens toward the bottom into a soft, pale cream or off-white tone. This gradient creates a warm, inviting atmosphere and helps emphasize the subjects within the glass case by providing contrast without distraction. Such gradients are commonly used in product photography to enhance visual appeal and draw attention to the central object. Based on the visual evidence, the background clearly exhibits this specific gradient pattern, moving from darker amber at the top to lighter cream at the bottom.",
