      "question": "Is the scene enclosed within a visible wooden shadow box frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the scene is clearly bounded by a square wooden frame with visible grain and depth, characteristic of a shadow box. The frame has a recessed interior, allowing three-dimensional elements to be displayed inside. This structure is typical of shadow boxes used in dioramas or artistic displays. The outer edges of the frame are prominent, and the lighting emphasizes its physical presence, confirming it is not just a border but an actual enclosure. Based on these visual cues and common knowledge about shadow box construction, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the tree been scaled down in size and rendered with enhanced 3D surface texture (e.g., visible bark details, depth, shading)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree appears significantly smaller than life-size, consistent with a miniature representation suitable for a diorama. The trunk and branches exhibit detailed textures, including visible grooves and ridges that mimic natural bark patterns. Additionally, there is clear depth and shading—light falls unevenly across the tree, creating shadows and highlights that enhance its three-dimensionality. These features suggest careful modeling and rendering techniques typical of handcrafted or digitally enhanced 3D objects. In contrast to a flat illustration, this tree has volume and tactile realism, supporting the conclusion that it has been scaled down and given enhanced 3D surface detail.",

      "question": "Are there visible, distinct patches of multi-colored flowers (e.g., pink, yellow, blue, red) beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the base of the tree in Image B, there are clearly defined clusters of flower-like elements arranged in patches. These patches display multiple colors: pink, blue, red, and white, resembling stylized floral designs. They appear to be crafted from fabric or paper and are embedded into a mossy ground layer, giving them a textured appearance. The arrangement is deliberate and spaced out, forming distinct zones rather than a uniform field. This matches the description of multi-colored flower patches. Although they are not realistic botanical specimens, their visual form and coloration fulfill the criteria of being 'visible, distinct patches of multi-colored flowers'.",

      "question": "Does the background consist of multiple layered painted surfaces that create a sense of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features vertical panels with varying hues and gradients—blues, greens, yellows, and soft whites—that resemble painted wood planks. These panels are not uniformly colored but show subtle transitions and brushwork, suggesting they were hand-painted. Furthermore, the way light interacts with the surface indicates different planes or layers, contributing to a sense of depth behind the tree. The use of varied tones and textures across the panels mimics a backdrop commonly found in dioramas, where layered materials simulate distance and atmosphere. This layered composition enhances spatial perception, making the scene feel more immersive.",

      "question": "Are there small, detailed cloud shapes visibly suspended by thin wires above or within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Above the tree in Image B, several cloud-shaped objects are present. These clouds are crafted from what appears to be delicate material—possibly paper or felt—and are attached to fine threads or wires that extend upward toward the top of the frame. The positioning of these clouds at different heights and angles suggests suspension, as if floating in mid-air. Their intricate design, including curled edges and layered forms, adds to their realism despite their miniature scale. The presence of these wire-suspended clouds is a hallmark of whimsical art installations, and their visibility confirms that they are intentionally placed within the scene.",

      "question": "Does the image include surreal or stylized elements (e.g., floating clouds, soft glow, pastel hues) that contribute to a whimsical and dreamlike atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains multiple surreal and stylized elements that evoke a dreamlike quality. The floating clouds suspended by invisible wires defy natural gravity, adding a magical touch. The color palette includes soft pastels—pale blues, gentle yellows, and muted pinks—commonly associated with fantasy or childlike wonder. The overall lighting is diffused, creating a warm, ethereal glow around the tree and flowers. Additionally, the artificial materials used for the flora and foliage, combined with the framed diorama format, remove the scene from reality and place it in a curated, imaginative space. Together, these elements foster a whimsical and fantastical ambiance.",
