      "question": "Does the airplane appear as a stylized 3D cartoon version with chibi characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The airplane in Image B has exaggerated proportions, such as a large, rounded nose and oversized features relative to its body, which are hallmarks of chibi-style animation. The overall design is simplified and stylized, with smooth, curved surfaces and vibrant colors, typical of 3D cartoon characters. These visual cues—such as the lack of realistic aerodynamic details and the playful form—align with chibi aesthetics commonly seen in animated media. This contrasts with real-world aircraft designs, which prioritize functionality and realism.",

      "question": "Does the airplane have oversized eyes and a cheerful smile on the nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The front of the airplane in Image B clearly features two large, round eyes positioned where the cockpit would be, along with a wide, smiling mouth drawn on the nose section. These anthropomorphic facial features are exaggerated and cartoonish, consistent with character design in animated films. Such elements are not present in real airplanes, which do not have facial features. The combination of these visual traits confirms that the airplane has been stylized to appear friendly and expressive.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The airplane in Image B is predominantly red, a color often associated with celebration and good fortune in Chinese culture. It is adorned with intricate golden patterns depicting dragons and phoenixes—mythical creatures symbolizing power, prosperity, and harmony in Chinese tradition. These motifs are clearly visible on the fuselage and wings, reinforcing a festive and culturally themed design. The use of such symbols aligns with traditional Chinese decorative art, especially during festivals like Lunar New Year.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the wings in Image B, multiple small, decorative tassels can be seen hanging from the wingtips. These tassels are gold-colored with red tops, resembling traditional Chinese ornamental elements often used in lanterns or ceremonial decorations. Their presence adds to the festive aesthetic of the plane and further emphasizes the cultural theme. This detail is not found in real aircraft but fits within the stylized, celebratory design of this cartoon airplane.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vertical stabilizer (tail) of the airplane in Image B prominently displays the Chinese character '囍', which represents 'double happiness'. This symbol is traditionally used in weddings and celebrations in Chinese culture. Its placement on the tail reinforces the festive and cultural theme of the aircraft. This is a deliberate artistic choice and not something found on real commercial planes, which typically feature airline logos or registration marks.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is filled with warm orange and yellow tones, characteristic of a sunset. The sun appears low on the horizon, casting long shadows and illuminating the scene with a golden glow. This lighting condition is consistent with a sunset environment. Additionally, the ambient light enhances the festive mood of the image, complementing the cultural elements of the airplane. This matches the visual cues of a golden hour setting.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the upper right portion of Image B, several red lanterns are visible floating in the sky. These lanterns are illuminated from within and have traditional Chinese designs, including tassels hanging from their bottoms. They are suspended at various heights and are consistent with those used during festivals such as the Lantern Festival. Their presence adds to the cultural and celebratory atmosphere of the scene, distinguishing it from a typical airport setting.",
