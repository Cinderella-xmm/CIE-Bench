    "Question": "Q1: Is the character designed as a stylized 3D chibi version?",
    "explanation": "The character in Image B exhibits exaggerated proportions typical of chibi art style—large head relative to body, simplified facial features with oversized eyes, and small limbs. The rendering has smooth, rounded surfaces and soft shading consistent with 3D modeling techniques. These visual cues, combined with common knowledge of chibi design conventions (often used in anime and digital avatars), confirm that the character is a stylized 3D chibi version.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the chibi character replicate the pose and clothing details from the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the person is in a wide martial arts stance with arms extended forward and palms open. In Image B, the chibi character mirrors this pose with arms outstretched and palms facing forward. The clothing—a black long-sleeve top and black pants—is also preserved in color and style. While the proportions are altered due to the chibi aesthetic, the core elements of the pose and attire are clearly replicated. This indicates intentional design continuity between the original and edited versions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the chibi character positioned sitting on the edge of an oversized Instagram frame?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a large, three-dimensional representation of an Instagram interface. The chibi character is seated on the bottom edge of the screen portion of this frame, with its legs extending downward. The frame itself is scaled up to be larger than life, creating a surreal, playful scene where the character interacts with it physically. This aligns with the description of being 'positioned sitting on the edge' of an oversized Instagram frame.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the character's legs dangling outside the frame and arms dynamically posed as instructed?",
    "explanation": "The chibi character’s legs are visibly hanging down from the edge of the Instagram frame, indicating they are dangling outside the frame. Its arms are spread outward with palms open, mirroring a dynamic, expressive gesture. This matches the description of being 'dynamically posed.' The pose suggests movement and energy, consistent with the original image’s posture, albeit adapted to fit the chibi form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the username 'Graceful' included at the top of the Instagram frame?",
    "explanation": "At the top of the Instagram-style interface in Image B, just below the header bar, the text 'Graceful' is clearly visible next to a profile icon. This matches the username field typically found in Instagram posts. Given that this is part of the mockup design, the inclusion of the username 'Graceful' is deliberate and accurately placed within the UI layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are various social media icons (like, comment, and share) floating around the scene?",
    "explanation": "Floating around the Instagram frame in Image B are several interactive icons commonly associated with social media platforms: a blue thumbs-up (like), red heart (love), speech bubble (comment), and a blue 'S' (share). These icons are stylized and appear to float in mid-air, enhancing the playful, digital aesthetic. Their presence confirms that multiple social media interaction symbols are included in the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
