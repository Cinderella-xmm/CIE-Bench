      "question": "Is the chair constructed entirely from visible LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the chair is clearly built using interlocking blocks that resemble LEGO bricks. The seat, backrest, and headrest are composed of stacked black bricks with visible studs on top, characteristic of LEGO construction. The armrests and base are made of metallic-looking silver pieces, which appear to be custom LEGO-like elements rather than standard bricks, but they are still part of a modular system consistent with LEGO design principles. While not every component is a traditional brick (e.g., the wheels and some structural parts), the entire chair is assembled from visible modular elements that mimic LEGO bricks in form and function. Therefore, it can be concluded that the chair is constructed entirely from visible LEGO-style components.",

      "question": "Are the seat and backrest cushions rendered in sleek black, resembling LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seat and backrest are indeed rendered in a sleek black color. However, they are not smooth cushions as one might expect in a real office chair. Instead, they are clearly constructed from multiple black LEGO-style bricks stacked together, with visible edges and studs. This gives them a blocky, segmented appearance typical of LEGO builds, rather than a continuous cushioned surface. Thus, while they are black and resemble LEGO bricks in structure, they do not have the soft, padded look of traditional cushions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the armrests and the five-star base of the chair are made of shiny, metallic-looking pieces that are silver in color. These components contrast with the black LEGO bricks used for the seat and backrest. The armrests are tubular and angular, consistent with LEGO Technic or similar structural elements, and the base features silver beams and connectors. The overall aesthetic matches the description of silver-colored components, indicating that this detail is accurate.",

      "question": "Are the wheels translucent gray in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels attached to the chair's base are transparent with a slight gray tint. They are not opaque or solid gray but appear translucent, allowing light to pass through them. This translucency is typical of certain LEGO wheel designs, especially those meant to simulate clear or frosted plastic. Given their appearance, they are best described as translucent gray rather than fully opaque or pure transparent.",

      "question": "Are the seat and backrest composed of visibly layered bricks with smooth gradients between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seat and backrest in Image B are clearly made of stacked LEGO-style bricks, showing distinct layers and sharp edges. However, there are no smooth gradients between the bricks; instead, the transitions are abrupt and geometric, preserving the modular nature of the construction. Each brick is separate, and the surfaces are flat and uniform, lacking any blending or gradient effect. This is consistent with how LEGO models are typically builtâ€”modular and precise, without smooth shading or blending.",

      "question": "Are the armrests designed as simple hinged parts without complex padding or curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armrests in Image B are constructed from straight, angular metal-like LEGO pieces. They lack any soft padding or organic curves, appearing instead as rigid, functional structures. Their design is minimalistic and mechanical, with visible joints and hinges that suggest articulation, but no cushioning or ergonomic shaping. This aligns with the idea of being simple hinged parts rather than ergonomically padded armrests.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chair resting on a flat, clean surface that is uniformly white and appears to be a tabletop. There are no patterns, textures, or objects on the surface, and the edges of the table are visible, confirming its presence. The lighting and shadows also suggest a solid, horizontal plane beneath the chair, consistent with a tabletop setting. Therefore, the chair is indeed placed on a plain white tabletop.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chair in Image B is constructed entirely from modular elements, with clearly visible brick edges and stud patterns on the black components. The design emphasizes sharp angles, straight lines, and repetitive stacking, all of which underscore the geometric nature of the build. Even the silver parts follow clean, linear forms. This visual clarity ensures that the modular construction is evident throughout, making the image an effective showcase of LEGO-style engineering.",
