    "Question": "Q1: Is the warrior statue composed entirely of LEGO bricks, with visible brick-like elements forming its body, limbs, and head?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the warrior statue exhibits a blocky, modular structure consistent with LEGO construction. The surface is composed of distinct rectangular and square elements with visible studs and interlocking patterns typical of LEGO bricks. These elements are clearly arranged to form the body, limbs, and head, with no continuous or smooth surfaces that would suggest another material. The geometric precision and uniformity of the segments support the conclusion that it is made entirely of LEGO bricks. This analysis is based on visual cues such as the presence of stud patterns, angular joints, and the overall segmented appearance, which aligns with known LEGO building techniques.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the primary colors used in the statue limited to shades of brown and tan?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is constructed using various shades of brown and tan LEGO bricks. These colors dominate the entire figure, from the headdress and face to the armor and legs. There are no visible accents of other colors such as black, red, or gold, which might be expected in some LEGO designs. The color palette appears intentionally restricted to earth tones, consistent with the aesthetic of ancient warrior figures. This limited palette enhances the cohesive look of the sculpture and reflects a deliberate design choice focused on realism within the constraints of LEGO materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the armor sections (such as chest plate, shoulder pads, and leg guards) made of smooth LEGO bricks without surface texture?",
    "explanation": "The armor sections in Image B, including the chest plate, shoulder pads, and leg guards, are not made of smooth LEGO bricks. Instead, they feature textured surfaces created by the arrangement of smaller bricks and stud patterns. For example, the chest plate has raised circular and rectangular elements that mimic decorative carvings, while the shoulder pads show layered brickwork that adds depth. These textures are not flat or seamless but rather composed of individual LEGO pieces that contribute to a detailed, non-smooth surface. Therefore, the armor sections do have surface texture, contrary to the claim of being made of smooth bricks.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the ornamental details such as the headdress, necklace, and carvings on the torso created using textured LEGO bricks with visible patterns?",
    "explanation": "The ornamental details in Image B, including the headdress, necklace, and torso carvings, are indeed crafted using textured LEGO bricks. The headdress features layered brickwork with alternating angles and stud patterns that simulate feather-like or ceremonial adornments. The necklace includes small, precisely placed bricks forming a geometric pattern, and the torso displays intricate designs achieved through varied brick placements and color gradients. These details are not flat or simple; instead, they rely on the modular nature of LEGO bricks to create visible, patterned textures. This level of detail suggests intentional use of textured elements to replicate traditional ornamentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO statue positioned on a plain white pedestal with no decorative elements, located in a gallery environment with framed artworks on the walls and track lighting overhead?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO statue standing on a clean, white pedestal that lacks any decorative elements such as engravings, carvings, or embellishments. The pedestal is simple and rectangular, consistent with museum display standards. The surrounding environment includes white walls with framed artworks arranged symmetrically, metal railings for crowd control, and overhead track lighting—typical features of a modern art gallery. These visual cues confirm that the statue is displayed in a gallery setting with professional lighting and curated presentation. The absence of decorative elements on the pedestal further supports the description of it being 'plain'.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Does the LEGO statue retain the same standing posture, facial expression, and proportional dimensions as the original wooden warrior?",
    "explanation": "To assess this, we compare Image B (the LEGO version) with Image A (the original wooden warrior). Both statues stand upright in a similar pose, with arms at their sides and feet planted firmly. The facial expression—neutral with defined eyes, nose, and mouth—is preserved in both versions, though the LEGO rendition uses blocky geometry to approximate the features. Proportional dimensions appear consistent: both figures are tall, with broad shoulders and elongated limbs. However, due to the inherent limitations of LEGO construction, minor deviations in symmetry and curvature may exist. Despite these, the overall posture, expression, and scale are faithfully maintained, indicating a high degree of fidelity in replication.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the statue visibly constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, with no continuous surfaces resembling carved wood?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is clearly composed of interlocking LEGO bricks. Each segment of the body, including the limbs, torso, and head, reveals the characteristic stud-and-tube connections of LEGO pieces. There are no smooth, continuous surfaces that would resemble carved wood; instead, every part is segmented into discrete blocks. Even areas that might be expected to be smooth, like the face or hands, are built from individual bricks with visible seams and edges. This contrasts sharply with the original wooden statue (Image A), which has flowing, organic contours and polished surfaces. Thus, the LEGO version maintains a distinctly modular appearance without any illusion of continuous wood carving.",
    "answer": "Yes"
