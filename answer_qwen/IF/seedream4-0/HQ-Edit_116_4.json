      "question": "Is the girl depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated features such as large eyes, simplified facial structure, and stylized proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's depiction clearly follows an anime or cartoon art style. Her eyes are significantly larger than those of a real human child, which is a hallmark of anime aesthetics. The facial structure is simplified—her cheeks are rounded, her nose is small and minimalistic, and her mouth is drawn with a simple curved line. Additionally, her proportions, such as the size of her head relative to her body and the stylization of her limbs, are consistent with typical cartoon or anime character design. These visual cues, combined with common knowledge about Japanese animation styles, confirm that the character is rendered in a cartoon style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the girl's kimono exaggerated with flowing, dynamic designs and rendered in significantly brighter, more vivid colors than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono worn by the girl displays highly vibrant and saturated colors, including bright yellows, pinks, purples, and blues, which are far more intense than what would typically be seen in traditional kimonos. The patterns are also more abstract and fluid, with swirling, dynamic motifs that resemble painted brushstrokes rather than realistic textile designs. In contrast, Image A shows a kimono with more subdued, naturalistic colors and intricate but traditional patterns. The difference in color saturation and pattern complexity between the two images supports the conclusion that Image B has exaggerated and stylized elements for artistic effect.",

      "question": "Have all the hanging lanterns been replaced with colorful spherical balloons of various bright colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the image retains many traditional orange paper lanterns along the sides of the market alley, there are indeed additional colorful spherical balloons (red, yellow, blue, green) floating above the scene, particularly near the top left and right corners. However, the majority of the hanging decorations remain the traditional lanterns. Therefore, not all lanterns have been replaced—only some have been augmented with balloons. This indicates a partial addition rather than a complete replacement.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible card titles displayed in bold, traditional-style fonts (such as brush script or kanji-based typefaces) within the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, there is a prominent red banner with large, bold characters written in a stylized kanji font that resembles traditional calligraphy. These characters are clearly legible and serve as a title or heading, consistent with the aesthetic of collectible cards or postcards. The use of such a font, especially in combination with the decorative layout, aligns with common design practices in Japanese-themed media and collectibles. This visual element confirms the presence of a card title in a traditional-style font.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clearly marked detachable section at the bottom of the image intended for short personal messages, such as a perforated line or designated space labeled for writing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of Image B, there are several rectangular boxes with light beige backgrounds and borders, each containing placeholder text in Chinese characters. These boxes resemble message fields commonly found on greeting cards or postcards. While there is no visible perforation line, the layout suggests a functional area meant for writing personal notes. The structured placement and labeling imply that this section is designed for user input, even if it lacks physical detaching features. Given the context and design conventions, this can be interpreted as a designated message area.",

      "question": "Is the overall image composed in a rectangular postcard format with clean borders and balanced layout suitable for printing as a collectible card?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is framed within a vertical rectangle with uniform margins, giving it a clean, structured appearance typical of postcards or collectible cards. The composition is balanced, with symmetrical elements (lanterns, stalls, and the central figure), and the visual hierarchy guides attention toward the girl and the title at the top. The inclusion of a title banner, decorative elements like balloons, and message fields at the bottom further supports its design as a collectible item. These features collectively suggest that the image is formatted for print use as a card or postcard.",
