      "question": "Has the log cabin been replaced with a geometric crystal structure made of transparent, faceted surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is clearly not a traditional log cabin. Instead, it is a large, geometrically shaped object composed of transparent, faceted surfaces that resemble a giant gemstone or crystal. The form is highly symmetrical and angular, with multiple reflective planes that catch and refract light, creating a prismatic effect. This contrasts sharply with the organic, wooden construction of a typical log cabin. Based on visual cues such as transparency, facets, and crystalline geometry, combined with common knowledge about architectural forms and materials, it is evident that the original log cabin has been replaced by this futuristic, crystal-like structure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the exterior surfaces of the structure consist of transparent, faceted planes that reflect or refract blue and green hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The exterior of the structure in Image B is composed of numerous transparent, angular planes that resemble cut crystal. These facets are highly reflective and refractive, displaying vivid shades of blue and green depending on the angle of light. This coloration is consistent with how light interacts with transparent, multi-faceted materials like glass or crystal, especially when tinted or under natural sunlight. The interplay of light across these surfaces creates a dynamic visual effect, confirming that the surfaces are indeed transparent and capable of reflecting and refracting colored light. This aligns with real-world optical behavior of such materials.",

      "question": "Have all wooden beams and structural supports been replaced with meticulously cut, multifaceted crystal edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible wooden beams or structural supports characteristic of a log cabin. Instead, the entire structure appears to be constructed from interconnected, precisely cut crystal facets that form its frame and walls. These edges are sharp, geometric, and uniform, suggesting a manufactured, crystalline framework rather than organic wood. The absence of any wooden elements—such as logs, posts, or railings—and the presence of only transparent, faceted components indicate that all original wooden structural elements have been replaced. This transformation is consistent with a complete architectural overhaul into a crystalline design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the crystal structure resting on a flat, white marble platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the structure in Image B is a wide, smooth, and flat surface that exhibits the veined texture and creamy white color typical of polished marble. The platform extends horizontally beneath the crystal structure and provides a clean, elevated foundation. Its appearance matches known characteristics of marble used in architectural installations—highly polished, durable, and visually distinct. Given that the structure is centrally positioned on this platform and there are no signs of direct ground contact, it is clear that the crystal structure rests upon this white marble base. This is consistent with artistic or architectural displays where such platforms are used for aesthetic and structural purposes.",

      "question": "Are there small crystal formations present as decorative accents along the base of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Along the perimeter of the white marble platform in Image B, there are several small, upright crystal-like objects arranged symmetrically. These formations mimic the shape and transparency of the larger structure, appearing as miniature versions of the main crystal. Their placement suggests intentional design as decorative elements, enhancing the overall aesthetic. These accents are consistent with the theme of the structure and are commonly used in art installations to create visual harmony and emphasize material continuity. Therefore, they serve as decorative accents at the base of the structure.",
