      "question": "Is the animal composed of small, distinct ceramic tiles arranged to form its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal's body is clearly constructed from numerous small, square-shaped elements that are tightly fitted together. These elements have a reflective, glossy surface and vary slightly in color and shade, which is characteristic of ceramic tiles used in mosaic art. The geometric pattern and uniformity of the pieces suggest they are not fabric or knitted material but rather hard, individual tiles. This conclusion is supported by world knowledge about mosaic construction, where such materials are commonly used to create detailed, durable artworks. The visual cues—such as sharp edges between pieces, consistent size, and reflective sheen—are all indicative of ceramic tiles.",

      "question": "Are the stripes made from glossy ceramic tiles in vibrant orange and deep black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stripes on the animal in Image B are formed by alternating sections of dark black and bright orange tiles. Each tile appears to have a smooth, shiny surface, consistent with glazed ceramic. The contrast between the colors is sharp and well-defined, indicating intentional placement of tiles with specific hues. The vibrancy of the orange and depth of the black align with typical ceramic glazing techniques used in decorative mosaics. Based on visual analysis and knowledge of ceramic tile properties, it is evident that these stripes are created using glossy ceramic tiles in those exact colors.",

      "question": "Are the eyes and snout formed from precisely cut ceramic tiles that maintain their expressive appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes and snout of the animal in Image B are composed of smaller, carefully arranged ceramic tiles. The eyes feature white tiles for the sclera, black tiles for the pupils, and subtle shading around them, creating a lifelike expression. The snout is made of darker tiles forming a rounded shape with defined contours. Despite being made of rigid, angular tiles, the arrangement preserves facial expressiveness through strategic placement and variation in tile color and size. This reflects advanced mosaic craftsmanship, where precision cutting and placement allow for detailed features even with non-flexible materials. World knowledge about mosaic art confirms that such expressive detail is achievable with careful tiling.",

      "question": "Is the mosaic animal positioned on a surface with a visible sandy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The animal in Image B is standing on a raised platform that has a granular, uneven surface resembling sand. The texture is coarse and irregular, with visible particles and slight indentations, consistent with natural sand. This contrasts with a smooth or polished surface and supports the idea that the platform is made of compacted sand. The lighting highlights the grainy nature of the surface, reinforcing the perception of sand. Given the beach setting in the background and the tactile appearance, it is reasonable to conclude that the surface has a visible sandy texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clear visual contrast between the smooth, glossy surface of the tiles and the rough, granular texture of the platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mosaic animal in Image B exhibits a highly reflective, smooth surface due to the glazed ceramic tiles, which catch and reflect light sharply. In contrast, the platform beneath it has a matte, textured surface with visible grains and irregularities typical of sand. This creates a strong visual contrast between the two surfaces—one shiny and uniform, the other dull and granular. This contrast is further emphasized by how light interacts with each material: the tiles produce specular highlights, while the sand scatters light diffusely. This difference in surface properties is a common artistic technique to draw attention to the object and enhance its three-dimensionality. Therefore, the contrast is both visually apparent and logically consistent with material properties.",
