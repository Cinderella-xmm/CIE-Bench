      "question": "Has the teapot been transformed into a candle holder with a visible candle or wick structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object retains the form of a teapot, including its spout, handle, lid, and ornate body. While it is highly reflective and metallic, there is no visible candle or wick structure inside or on top of the teapot. A candle holder typically has an opening for a candle or a central cavity where a wick would be placed, but none of these features are present. Additionally, the object's design remains consistent with that of a decorative teapot rather than a functional candle holder. The presence of a long spoon-like object above the teapot does not suggest a candle-related function. Therefore, based on visual inspection and common knowledge about candle holders, the teapot has not been transformed into one.",

      "question": "Is the body of the object now made of glass with visible intricate embossed patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the object in Image B appears to be made of a reflective, metallic material—likely silver or polished metal—given its high shine and ability to reflect light and surroundings. While the surface has intricate embossed patterns, these are characteristic of metalwork craftsmanship rather than glass. Glass objects typically have different optical properties, such as transparency or translucency, which are absent here. The reflections are sharp and mirror-like, consistent with metal, not glass. Moreover, glass would likely show signs of refraction or internal light diffusion, which is not observed. Thus, despite the detailed ornamentation, the material is not glass.",

      "question": "Has the lid been redesigned into a decorative finial-style candle snuffer with a snuffing mechanism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lid of the teapot in Image B maintains its original shape and structure, featuring a domed top with a small finial knob. There is no evidence of a snuffing mechanism, such as a cup or bell-shaped end designed to extinguish a flame. Candle snuffers are typically separate tools with a distinct shape and function, often used in conjunction with candles. The lid here remains part of the teapot’s closure system and does not extend into a functional snuffer. While the finial is decorative, it lacks any components that would allow it to act as a snuffer. Based on the visual cues and general knowledge of candle snuffers, this transformation has not occurred.",

      "question": "Has the tablecloth been replaced with a sleek, reflective marble base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is placed on a circular, white surface with gray veining, characteristic of marble. This surface is smooth, reflective, and has a polished finish, unlike the lace tablecloth seen in Image A. The base also appears to be elevated and possibly mounted on a stand, as indicated by the reflection and the visible edge beneath. The presence of a nameplate labeled 'Elegance Aroma' further suggests a deliberate display setup, typical of a marble pedestal. In contrast to the flowing, textured lace cloth in Image A, the base in Image B is clearly a solid, stone-like material. Therefore, the tablecloth has indeed been replaced with a marble base.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small nameplate on the side of the container with the text \"Elegance Aroma\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, a small rectangular plaque is visible on the front edge of the marble base, just below the teapot. The plaque has gold-colored lettering that reads 'Elegance Aroma'. This is consistent with branding or labeling commonly found on luxury or decorative items. The placement and style of the nameplate suggest it is meant to identify the product or collection. This feature is not present in Image A, where the base is covered with lace and lacks any visible text. Therefore, based on the visual evidence, the nameplate is present.",
