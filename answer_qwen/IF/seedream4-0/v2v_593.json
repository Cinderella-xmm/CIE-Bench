      "question": "Has the kangaroo been redesigned to resemble a Funko Pop figure box in an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kangaroo is not redesigned to resemble a Funko Pop figure box. Instead, a Funko Pop-style collectible figure of a kangaroo is displayed inside a box labeled 'BOUNCY COMPANION'. The box itself is designed in a typical Funko Pop packaging style, with a clear plastic window and colorful branding. The kangaroo in the image is shown as a separate, realistic animal standing beside the box. There is no indication that the kangaroo has been redesigned into a box or presented in an isometric perspective. The term 'isometric perspective' refers to a type of 3D representation where all three axes are equally scaled and angles are preserved, but this is not applied to the kangaroo here. Therefore, the kangaroo has not been redesigned into a box or rendered in such a perspective.",

      "question": "Is the packaging labeled with the name \"BOUNCY COMPANION\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging clearly displays the text 'BOUNCY COMPANION' on both the front and top of the box. This label is prominently featured in bold lettering, consistent with the branding style of Funko Pop products. The name is repeated below the windowed section of the box and also appears near the top, reinforcing its identity. Given that the text is legible and directly visible, it confirms that the packaging is indeed labeled with the name 'BOUNCY COMPANION'.",

      "question": "Does the box contain a chibi-style kangaroo figure with a pouch, a grassy base, and hopping-related elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box in Image B contains a stylized, chibi-style kangaroo figure, which is characteristic of Funko Pop designs—large head, small body, and simplified features. The figure has a visible pouch, which is a key anatomical feature of kangaroos and often emphasized in toy representations. It stands on a green, grass-like base, suggesting a natural environment, and there is a small white object resembling a ball or egg, possibly indicating a playful or hopping theme. These elements align with the idea of 'hopping-related elements', such as the dynamic pose and setting. Therefore, the contents match the description provided.",

      "question": "Is there a highly realistic version of the kangaroo figure depicted outside the packaging with intricate textures and lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Outside the packaging in Image B, there is a depiction of a kangaroo that is highly detailed and realistic. Its fur texture is finely rendered, showing variations in color and shading, and the lighting highlights the contours of its body, creating depth and volume. The eyes, ears, and limbs are anatomically accurate, and the overall appearance suggests a digital rendering or photorealistic model rather than a toy. This contrasts sharply with the stylized chibi figure inside the box. The use of lighting, such as subtle glows and shadows, further enhances the realism. Thus, the external kangaroo is indeed a highly realistic version with intricate textures and lighting.",

      "question": "Has the original kangaroo's pose and setting been maintained while integrating the new elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the original kangaroo is shown mid-hop on a dirt path surrounded by green grass and trees, in a natural park-like setting. In Image B, the same background and setting are preserved—the dirt path, grass, and trees remain consistent. However, the kangaroo’s pose has changed: instead of being in motion, it is now standing upright and stationary beside the Funko Pop box. While the environment is maintained, the kangaroo’s dynamic action from Image A (jumping) is replaced with a static pose in Image B. Therefore, although the setting is preserved, the original pose has not been maintained. The integration of the Funko Pop box and the realistic kangaroo figure alters the primary subject’s behavior and posture.",
