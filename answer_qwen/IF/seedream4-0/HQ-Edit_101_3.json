      "question": "Has the bird been converted into a stylized illustrated emblem rather than remaining a photorealistic depiction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is depicted with smooth, uniform coloration and simplified feather details, lacking the fine textural nuances and depth of shadow seen in photorealistic images. The edges are clean and consistent, suggesting digital illustration rather than photographic realism. Additionally, the proportions appear slightly exaggerated for visual appeal—such as the large, round eye and simplified beak—which are common traits in stylized illustrations. This contrasts with typical photorealism, which emphasizes accurate representation of light, texture, and anatomical detail. Therefore, based on these visual cues and artistic conventions, the bird has been rendered as a stylized emblem.",

      "question": "Is the bird's primary color still a vibrant shade of yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B maintains a bright, saturated yellow hue across its body, consistent with the original image’s color scheme. Even though it is stylized, the yellow remains vivid and dominant, with no significant desaturation or shift in tone. In both images, the yellow serves as a focal point against the softer background colors. The consistency in color choice suggests intentional design continuity, preserving the bird’s visual impact. Thus, despite the stylistic change, the primary color remains a vibrant yellow.",

      "question": "Are cherry blossom motifs visibly surrounding the bird emblem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, pink cherry blossoms are clearly illustrated around the bird, appearing on branches that extend from both sides and below the bird. These floral elements are stylized but recognizable as cherry blossoms due to their five-petaled structure, delicate pink coloring, and central stamens. They frame the bird symmetrically, enhancing the decorative nature of the design. This matches known cultural representations of cherry blossoms in East Asian art, often used in packaging to evoke spring and elegance. The presence of these motifs is unambiguous and integral to the composition.",

      "question": "Is there a typographic logo located at the top of the packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the upper portion of the box in Image B, there is a vertical arrangement of two Chinese characters (茶王), which translates to 'Tea King' or 'King of Tea'. Below them, smaller English text reads 'LUMIN TEA', indicating a brand name. This placement and format are characteristic of a typographic logo used in product branding. The use of traditional script alongside modern typography aligns with aesthetic trends in premium tea packaging, especially those aiming to blend cultural heritage with contemporary design. Hence, this confirms the presence of a typographic logo at the top.",

      "question": "Does the background feature a soft pastel gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B transitions smoothly from a pale white at the top to a soft pink at the bottom, forming a gentle gradient. This pastel palette is consistent with minimalist and elegant design aesthetics commonly used in luxury consumer products like tea packaging. The gradient enhances the visual harmony between the bird and floral elements without distracting from them. Such gradients are often employed to create a sense of depth and serenity, reinforcing the tranquil theme associated with tea culture. Therefore, the background indeed features a soft pastel gradient.",

      "question": "Is the overall composition arranged as a structured packaging design resembling a tea box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a rectangular box with visible edges and corners, standing upright on a flat surface. The front face contains a cohesive graphic design featuring the bird, flowers, and text, all aligned within a balanced layout typical of commercial product packaging. The inclusion of a brand name ('LUMIN TEA'), stylized imagery, and clean lines supports the interpretation that this is a designed product package. Furthermore, the dimensions and proportions resemble those of a standard tea box, commonly used for premium or artisanal teas. The combination of these structural and visual cues confirms that the composition is a structured packaging design resembling a tea box.",
