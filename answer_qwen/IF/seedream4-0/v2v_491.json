      "question": "Does the bear figure feature precise proportions and intricate fur details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear figure is clearly a stylized, sculpted object rather than a live animal. Its proportions are exaggerated in a way typical of collectible figurines—such as larger eyes and a more rounded body shape—which deviates from natural bear anatomy. The fur is rendered with a patterned texture that mimics fur but lacks the randomness and depth of real fur. Instead, it has a uniform, almost carved appearance, suggesting it's made of plastic or resin. While the detailing is intricate in terms of surface patterns, it does not reflect the biological complexity of real fur. Therefore, the figure has detailed textures but not realistic proportions or naturalistic fur.",

      "question": "Does the bear figure have emotive eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bear figure in Image B features large, round eyes with visible pupils and highlights, which are characteristic of anime or cartoon-style designs. These eyes are expressive and convey a sense of emotion—specifically, a slightly concerned or curious look—through their wide-open shape and upward tilt. The use of shading and reflection in the eyes enhances this emotional effect. In contrast to realistic animal eyes, which would be more subtle and less stylized, these eyes are intentionally designed to evoke empathy or engagement, aligning with common techniques in character design. Thus, the eyes are emotive in a stylized, artistic sense.",

      "question": "Is the bear figure placed on a desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bear figure in Image B is positioned on a flat, light-colored surface with objects such as a smartphone, a keyboard, and what appears to be a computer monitor in the background. These elements are typical of an office or workspace environment. The surface has a smooth, reflective quality consistent with a desk, and the arrangement of items suggests a desktop setup. Additionally, the presence of a phone capturing the bear further supports the idea that this is a staged scene on a desk. This contrasts with Image A, where the bear is in a natural forest setting. Here, the context strongly indicates an indoor, human-made environment.",

      "question": "Is there a realistic, scaled-down model of the backpack included in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backpack in Image B is identical in size and design to the one in Image A, suggesting it is not a scaled-down model but rather a full-sized backpack placed next to the bear figurine. The proportions of the backpack relative to the bear figure indicate that the backpack is life-sized, while the bear is a small statue. If it were a scaled-down version, it would appear disproportionately smaller. Moreover, the backpack’s materials and stitching details are consistent with a real-world item, not a miniature replica. Therefore, it is not a scaled-down model but a full-size backpack used for visual comparison.",

      "question": "Does the scene have a casual, natural vibe, as if captured using a smartphone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B has a staged, curated feel rather than a casual, spontaneous one. The lighting is even and professional, the composition is carefully balanced, and the inclusion of a smartphone displaying the same image suggests intentional documentation. The presence of a computer monitor and office supplies adds to the artificial, controlled environment. Unlike Image A, which has a natural forest backdrop and soft, ambient lighting, Image B feels like a product photo or digital art setup. While a smartphone may have been used to capture the image, the overall aesthetic is polished and deliberate, not candid or natural.",

      "question": "Does the bear figure seamlessly combine lifelike textures with distinctive Japanese anime-style elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bear figure in Image B exhibits a blend of realistic and stylized features. The texture of the fur is detailed and resembles real bear fur in pattern and layering, giving it a lifelike appearance. However, the facial features—especially the large, expressive eyes with prominent eyelashes and eyebrows—are unmistakably inspired by Japanese anime aesthetics. These elements are exaggerated and anthropomorphic, diverging from natural bear anatomy. The combination of realistic texturing with anime-like facial traits creates a hybrid style that merges realism with fantasy. This fusion is common in modern collectible figures and digital art, where lifelike materials are paired with stylized expressions. Thus, the figure successfully blends both elements.",
