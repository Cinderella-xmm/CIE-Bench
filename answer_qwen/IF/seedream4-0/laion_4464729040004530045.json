      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B is dressed in attire that strongly aligns with Victorian-era fashion. Her dress features a high-neck bodice, lace trim, a corseted waist, and a full skirt with floral patterns—hallmarks of 19th-century fashion. She also wears lace gloves, pearl necklaces, and dainty earrings, all consistent with Victorian aesthetics. Her hairstyle and makeup (including winged eyeliner) are styled to complement this look, even though modern touches like sunglasses remain. The background—a lush garden with ornate ironwork—further reinforces the Victorian theme. This combination of clothing, accessories, and setting supports the conclusion that she has been transformed into a Victorian-era lady.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's dress clearly displays a high-neck bodice. The neckline is adorned with delicate white lace trim, which extends outward in a ruffled pattern typical of Victorian fashion. This detail is visually distinct and consistent with historical garments from the era, where lace was commonly used for decorative purposes around collars and cuffs. The contrast between the black fabric of the bodice and the white lace enhances its visibility and authenticity.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower portion of the dress in Image B consists of a wide, full skirt that expands outward from the waist, characteristic of Victorian silhouettes. The skirt is decorated with large, soft-toned floral motifs—roses and leaves—in muted colors such as pink, green, and cream—typical of floral prints popular during the Victorian period. The volume suggests the use of a crinoline or petticoat underneath, common in that era’s fashion. Thus, both the shape and pattern confirm the presence of a voluminous, floral-adorned skirt.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman wears a multi-strand pearl choker around her neck, which contrasts sharply with the metallic, spiked choker seen in Image A. Pearls were a staple accessory in Victorian fashion, often worn in layered strands as symbols of elegance and status. The shift from a modern, edgy metallic choker to a classic pearl choker reflects a deliberate transformation toward a more historically accurate and refined aesthetic appropriate for the Victorian era.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The earrings visible in Image B are small, dangling, and appear to be made of pearls or a similar material with intricate detailing. They are not bold or industrial but rather delicate and ornate, fitting the dainty style typical of Victorian jewelry. During the Victorian era, women often wore drop earrings with gemstones or pearls, especially in formal wear. These earrings match that description and complement the overall vintage look.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is wearing lace gloves on both hands. The gloves extend from the fingertips up to just below the elbow, covering most of the forearm.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A wrought iron bench is clearly visible in the background of Image B, positioned to the left of the woman. It has an ornate, scroll-like design typical of 19th-century garden furniture. Wrought iron benches were common in Victorian gardens, serving both functional and decorative purposes.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the woman’s facial features—including her jawline, nose, eyes, and overall face shape—are identical. Her body proportions, such as the width of her shoulders, the length of her arms, and her torso, are also consistent. While her clothing and accessories have changed dramatically, her physical characteristics remain unchanged, indicating that only her outfit and environment were altered, not her underlying appearance. This suggests digital editing focused on styling rather than altering her identity.",
