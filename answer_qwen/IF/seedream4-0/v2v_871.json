        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the image is vertically oriented, we examine the aspect ratio and composition. The image displays a glass display case with a pear, a LEGO minifigure, and a LEGO animal inside. The frame of the image appears wider than it is tall, which suggests a horizontal orientation. Additionally, the background transitions from caramel to cream across a broad expanse, supporting a landscape (horizontal) format. A vertical image would have a taller-than-wide proportion, which is not observed here. Based on visual cues and standard photographic framing conventions, this image is horizontally oriented.",

      "question": "Has a traditional LEGO minifigure been added next to the pear-inspired animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a LEGO minifigure positioned next to a LEGO animal resembling a boar or similar creature. The figure has the classic design elements of a traditional LEGO minifigure: articulated limbs, a head with printed facial features, and torso with printed clothing details. It stands beside the pear-shaped object, which is placed on a base within the display case. This confirms that a traditional LEGO minifigure has indeed been added in proximity to the pear-inspired animal. The presence of these figures aligns with typical LEGO set aesthetics and construction.",

      "question": "Does the pear-inspired animal feature a polished, seamless style with a bitten section that complements the pear's characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pear in Image B is a real fruit with a visible bite taken out of it, showing its white flesh and natural texture. However, the 'pear-inspired animal' mentioned in the question does not appear to be a stylized animal form made from the pear. Instead, the pear remains a literal fruit, albeit with a bite mark. There is no indication of an animal shape sculpted from the pear or designed to mimic one. Therefore, while the pear has a bitten section, it does not feature a polished, seamless animal form. The description seems to misinterpret the object — it is simply a bitten pear, not an animal representation. Thus, the claim about a pear-inspired animal with a seamless style is not accurate.",

      "question": "Are both figures enclosed within a transparent glass cube that reflects the natural wood grain look and color of the backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a clear glass cube housing the pear, the LEGO minifigure, and the LEGO animal. The glass is transparent and reflects light, allowing visibility of the contents. However, the reflections on the glass do not clearly show the natural wood grain or color of the backdrop. Instead, the reflections appear to include parts of the surrounding environment, such as the two-toned background (caramel and cream), but not distinct wood grain patterns. The base of the display case is black, and the backdrop behind the glass is smooth and painted, not wooden. Therefore, while the glass cube is present and reflective, it does not reflect a natural wood grain look or color. The reflection effect is minimal and does not match the described detail.",

      "question": "Does the image utilize sophisticated lighting with warm hues that align with the original photo's tones, and does the background transition smoothly from a soft caramel shade to a gentle cream tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is soft and even, casting gentle highlights on the glass case and the objects inside, suggesting a controlled studio setup. The overall color palette includes warm tones — particularly in the background, which transitions from a rich caramel on the left to a lighter cream on the right. This gradient is smooth and visually harmonious, contributing to a sophisticated aesthetic. The lighting enhances the textures of the pear, LEGO figures, and glass, without harsh shadows. These visual cues indicate deliberate use of warm, balanced lighting consistent with professional photography. The background transition is indeed smooth, reinforcing the intended mood. While Image A has a simpler brown wooden surface, Image B expands on it with a more refined, artistic background treatment. This suggests a continuation of tonal warmth but with enhanced visual depth.",
