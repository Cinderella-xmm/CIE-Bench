      "question": "Is the building's facade composed of visible, blocky LEGO-like bricks forming the overall structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building's facade clearly shows a pattern of interlocking, rectangular blocks that resemble LEGO bricks. These blocks are uniformly sized and arranged in a grid-like fashion, with visible seams and studs typical of LEGO construction. The texture and geometry of the surface—especially around corners, window frames, and structural elements—are consistent with LEGO brick design. This is not a realistic brick wall but rather a stylized, toy-like representation. Based on visual cues such as the repetitive block pattern, stud details, and lack of mortar lines, it is evident that the facade is intentionally rendered to look like LEGO bricks. This conclusion aligns with common knowledge about LEGO architecture models, where buildings are constructed from modular blocks.",

      "question": "Are the building’s bricks rendered in muted red tones and the window frames in muted blue tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the building's bricks are primarily a bright, saturated red—not muted. The color is vivid and consistent with LEGO brick aesthetics, which often use bold colors. Additionally, the window frames are white or light gray, not blue. While some small green elements (like LEGO vines) appear on the facade, there is no evidence of blue window frames. Muted tones suggest dullness or low saturation, but here the colors are vibrant and high-contrast. Therefore, the description of 'muted red' and 'muted blue' does not match the visual evidence. This analysis relies on color perception and knowledge of LEGO color palettes, which typically feature bright, primary colors.",

      "question": "Have the climbing plants been replaced with green, segmented LEGO-style vines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the climbing plants that were present on the original building (as seen in Image A) have indeed been transformed into green, segmented structures made of LEGO-like pieces. These vines consist of repeating, cylindrical green elements connected in a chain-like fashion, resembling LEGO plant or vine accessories. They follow the same vertical path as the original ivy but are now clearly artificial and modular. This transformation is consistent with LEGO design principles, where natural elements are abstracted into blocky, geometric forms. By comparing the texture, shape, and segmentation of these green elements to standard LEGO plant sets, we can confirm they are not real plants but stylized LEGO versions.",

      "question": "Do all balconies feature gray, blocky LEGO-style railings instead of realistic metal or decorative designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The balconies in Image B are constructed with gray, angular railings that mimic LEGO architectural pieces. These railings are made of flat, stacked blocks with visible joints and uniform spacing, lacking the smooth curves or ornamental details seen in real-world wrought iron or decorative metalwork. Each balcony has a consistent, modular appearance, reinforcing the LEGO aesthetic. There are no signs of realistic metal textures or intricate designs; instead, every railing follows the same blocky, geometric style. This transformation aligns with how LEGO builds structures—using standardized parts for consistency. Thus, all balconies conform to this LEGO-style design, replacing realistic elements with simplified, toy-like equivalents.",

      "question": "Is the LEGO building situated on a flat, simple platform that contrasts with the surrounding environment to highlight its blocky aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the building appears to be on a flat, light-colored surface that resembles a LEGO platform. This platform lacks detailed textures such as pavement cracks, grass, or shadows that would suggest a real-world sidewalk. It is uniformly colored and smooth, creating a stark contrast with the more complex surroundings like parked cars and trees. This simplification emphasizes the blocky nature of the building, making it stand out as a constructed model rather than part of a realistic urban scene. The absence of realistic ground details supports the interpretation that the building is placed on a deliberate, artificial platform to enhance its LEGO-like appearance. This is a common technique in digital art or toy modeling to isolate and showcase the subject.",
