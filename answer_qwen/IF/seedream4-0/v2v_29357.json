        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground is visibly covered in a thick layer of white material that has the texture and appearance of snow. The surface is uneven and soft-looking, consistent with snow accumulation. Additionally, the child's skateboard is partially sinking into the ground, which is typical when riding on snow rather than hard pavement. This visual evidence, combined with common knowledge about snowy environments, supports the conclusion that snow is layered across the ground.",

      "question": "Are the nearby plants covered with frost?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plants in the background of Image B are coated with a white, crystalline substance that adheres to their branches and leaves. This appearance is characteristic of frost, which forms when moisture in the air freezes onto surfaces during cold conditions. The delicate, feathery texture of the coating further supports this identification. Frost typically occurs in winter or cold climates, which aligns with the overall scene. Therefore, based on the visual cues and world knowledge about frost formation, it can be concluded that the plants are indeed covered with frost.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a muted, gray sky with no visible sunlight or shadows, suggesting an overcast condition. The presence of snow and frost indicates cold temperatures. The child is dressed in warm clothing (jacket, gloves, beanie), which people typically wear in cold weather. Together, these elements—overcast lighting, snow-covered ground, and heavy clothing—create a chilly and subdued atmosphere. This aligns with common perceptions of winter scenes, reinforcing the conclusion that the ambiance is chilly and overcast.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The child in Image B is wearing a thick, brown outer garment with a hood, multiple pockets, and a zippered front—typical features of a winter jacket designed for warmth. The material appears insulated, and the jacket covers the torso fully, protecting against cold weather. Given the snowy environment and the child’s other winter attire (gloves, beanie), it is logical to infer that the jacket is intended to provide warmth. Thus, based on both visual cues and common sense about winter clothing, the child is wearing a warm jacket.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The child in Image B is wearing a dark, knitted cap that covers the head and ears, with a rounded top and a slightly folded brim at the front. This style is consistent with a beanie, which is commonly worn in cold weather to retain heat. The texture appears to be knit, typical of beanies made from wool or synthetic fibers. Unlike a baseball cap, which is more structured and stiff, this hat conforms closely to the head shape, supporting the identification as a beanie.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The child's hands in Image B are covered with black, fingered garments that appear to be made of a thick, flexible material suitable for cold weather. These items extend past the wrists and fit snugly, matching the appearance of gloves. They are clearly not bare hands, mittens, or sleeves alone. Gloves are commonly worn in snowy conditions to protect hands from cold and moisture, and the presence of snow and frost in the scene makes this attire appropriate. Therefore, based on visual inspection and contextual knowledge, the child is wearing gloves.",
