    "Question": "Q1: Is the gorilla depicted as a wood-carved sculpture rather than a living animal?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla exhibits characteristics consistent with a wooden sculpture. The surface has a uniform brown coloration with visible wood grain patterns and carved textures that mimic fur. The lighting reflects off the surface in a way typical of polished wood, not skin or fur. Additionally, the edges are sharply defined and lack the softness and natural variation seen in living animals. These visual cues, combined with common knowledge about wood carvings, strongly suggest the gorilla is a sculpted representation rather than a living creature.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the contours of the gorilla's body defined using multiple shades of brown?",
    "explanation": "The image shows the gorilla's form rendered in varying tones of brown, from light tan to deep mahogany. These gradations are used to create depth and highlight anatomical features such as the shoulders, arms, and legs. This use of shading is consistent with wood carving techniques where different depths and finishes produce contrast. The interplay of light and shadow across the surface further emphasizes these tonal variations, indicating intentional use of multiple shades to define the body’s contours.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are detailed fur-like textures engraved into the surface of the wooden sculpture?",
    "explanation": "The surface of the gorilla in Image B displays fine, linear engravings that resemble individual strands of fur. These lines follow the natural direction of hair growth on a primate and are deeply incised into the wood, suggesting careful craftsmanship. Such detailing is typical in high-quality wood carvings aiming to replicate realistic textures. Given that real fur would not appear this way on wood, the engraving is clearly an artistic interpretation meant to simulate fur texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the arms and legs of the sculpture visibly smoother than the rest of the body, lacking fine anatomical detail?",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection, the arms and legs of the gorilla in Image B do not appear smoother than other parts of the body. Instead, they feature the same level of intricate carving, including textured lines that mimic muscle definition and fur. The joints and limbs show clear attention to anatomical accuracy and detail, consistent with the rest of the sculpture. Therefore, there is no evidence of reduced detail in these areas.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the leafy backdrop been replaced with an etched wooden surface?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a background composed of a flat wooden surface with subtle grain patterns. Scattered across it are dark, stylized leaf shapes that appear to be either inlaid or burned into the wood, resembling decorative etching. This contrasts sharply with the dense, green foliage seen in typical jungle environments. The overall aesthetic suggests a crafted, artistic backdrop rather than a natural one, supporting the conclusion that the original leafy environment has been replaced with a wooden, etched design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there a few dark-toned leaf shapes integrated into the wooden background, matching the wood carving style?",
    "explanation": "Yes, the background of Image B includes several dark-colored leaf shapes that are stylistically consistent with the carving technique used for the gorilla. These leaves are arranged around the figure and appear to be either carved into or applied onto the wooden surface. Their appearance—detailed, slightly raised, and shaded—matches the artistic style of the sculpture, indicating they are part of the same design language and material treatment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the gorilla maintain the same seated posture and hand placement as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "To assess this, we compare Image B to Image A. In both images, the gorilla is seated on a horizontal surface (a moss-covered log in Image A, a wooden branch in Image B), with its right arm bent and hand resting near the chin in a contemplative pose. The left arm is extended downward, and the legs are tucked beneath the body. Despite differences in medium and setting, the overall posture—including head tilt, limb positioning, and hand placement—is preserved. This indicates that the artist maintained the original pose while transforming the subject into a wooden sculpture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
