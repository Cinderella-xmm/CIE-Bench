    "Question": "Q1: Is the facade of the theater building constructed from visible tan LEGO bricks with brown accents?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facade of the theater building displays a distinct blocky texture consistent with LEGO construction. The primary color of the walls is a light tan or beige, which is typical of standard LEGO bricks used for buildings. The decorative elements, such as the cornices, arches, and roofline details, are rendered in a darker brown, matching the color scheme commonly used in LEGO architectural sets. The modular pattern of the bricks is clearly visible, especially in areas where the surface is not covered by windows or other features. This visual evidence, combined with world knowledge that LEGO models use interlocking bricks with uniform shapes and sizes, supports the conclusion that the facade is made of tan LEGO bricks with brown accents.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the large arched windows replaced with translucent square LEGO pieces arranged in a grid pattern?",
    "explanation": "The large arched windows in Image B are composed of small, square, translucent pieces that mimic glass blocks. These pieces are arranged in a precise grid pattern, forming the shape of the original arched windows. This design is characteristic of LEGO architecture sets, where translucent elements are used to simulate windows. The grid structure and uniformity of the pieces strongly suggest they are LEGO elements rather than real glass. Furthermore, the way the light appears to diffuse through these panels aligns with how translucent LEGO bricks behave under lighting. This matches known LEGO construction techniques, confirming that the windows are indeed made of translucent square LEGO pieces in a grid.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the marquee signs for 'Walgreens' and 'Marina Theater' rendered using smooth red flat LEGO bricks to form the letters?",
    "explanation": "The marquee signs in Image B display the names 'Walgreens' and 'Marina Theater' in a stylized font. The background of each sign is a solid red, which is consistent with the appearance of smooth red flat LEGO bricks often used in signage. The letters themselves appear to be formed from individual brick elements, possibly using printed tiles or specialized LEGO letter pieces, but the overall aesthetic suggests they are constructed from flat, smooth LEGO bricks. In LEGO sets, such signs are typically built using flat plates or tiles with printed text or assembled with individual letter bricks. The clean edges and uniform texture support the idea that smooth red flat LEGO bricks were used to create the signs.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are both vintage cars rendered as blocky LEGO vehicles, one in black and one in purple, with angular, modular features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the two vintage cars are clearly modeled in a style consistent with LEGO vehicles. They exhibit angular, geometric forms typical of LEGO designs, with modular components such as wheels, bodies, and windows that resemble LEGO parts. The car on the left is predominantly black, while the one on the right is purple, both featuring blocky structures and simplified details. The wheels are circular but have a distinct LEGO look, and the body panels are segmented in a way that reflects LEGO's construction method. These visual cues, combined with knowledge of LEGO vehicle models, confirm that the cars are blocky LEGO representations with angular, modular features.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the entire scene—including the building, cars, and signage—appear as a cohesive, playful, miniature LEGO model with consistent blocky textures and toy-like proportions?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a scene where every element—the building, cars, trees, signage, and even the ground—exhibits the same blocky, modular texture characteristic of LEGO constructions. The proportions are exaggerated and simplified, typical of toy models, with uniform brick patterns and stylized details. The consistency in material appearance across all objects, including the use of translucent windows, flat brick signs, and modular vehicles, creates a unified, playful aesthetic. This cohesion, along with the recognizable LEGO design language, indicates that the entire scene is intended to represent a miniature LEGO model. The absence of realistic textures or materials further supports this interpretation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
