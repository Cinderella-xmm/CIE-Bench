      "question": "Does the smartphone screen display a sci-fi mission control interface instead of financial charts and stock data?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the smartphone screen still displays elements resembling financial data, such as stock tickers (e.g., CTMX, CSCO, AAPL), percentage changes, and line graphs. However, these elements are now rendered in a futuristic blue monochrome style with glowing outlines and digital effects, giving them a high-tech appearance. While the aesthetic is more advanced and stylized than typical financial apps, the core content remains financial data rather than a mission control interface. A true sci-fi mission control interface would likely include radar-like displays, real-time telemetry, or spacecraft status indicators—none of which are present. Thus, despite the enhanced visual style, the content is still financial in nature.",

      "question": "Are blue accents still prominently featured in the smartphone and laptop displays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the smartphone and laptop screens are dominated by shades of blue. The smartphone’s interface uses bright cyan-blue for text, icons, and chart lines, while the laptop screen displays a vibrant cityscape under a blue sky, with glowing blue architectural highlights and interface overlays. These blue tones are consistent across both devices, suggesting a deliberate design choice to emphasize a futuristic, tech-oriented aesthetic. Blue is commonly used in digital interfaces to convey calmness, professionalism, and technological sophistication, which aligns with the sci-fi theme. Therefore, blue remains a dominant color in both displays.",

      "question": "Are there visible holographic widgets or floating 3D elements on the smartphone screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows several translucent, glowing blue elements that appear to float above the smartphone screen. These include small cube-like structures and abstract data nodes connected by light trails. Additionally, there is a semi-transparent handprint overlay near the bottom left of the phone, suggesting biometric scanning. These elements are not confined to the screen's surface but seem to extend into the space around it, creating a sense of depth. This visual effect mimics holographic projections, which are common in science fiction depictions of advanced technology. Thus, these are best interpreted as holographic widgets or floating 3D elements.",

      "question": "Does the smartphone screen appear to project forward, creating a sense of depth or holographic extension beyond the device?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smartphone in Image B exhibits visual cues that suggest a three-dimensional projection. The interface elements, such as the circular gauges and data streams, have a layered appearance with soft glows and transparent overlays that extend outward from the screen. Furthermore, the floating holographic components (like the cubes and handprint) are positioned in front of the phone, not on its surface, implying that the display is projecting into physical space. This effect is enhanced by the lighting and shadowing, which give the impression of depth. Such rendering techniques are often used to simulate holographic displays in futuristic settings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, a detailed biometric scan of the hand is clearly visible in Image B. It appears as a translucent blue outline of the hand with fingerprint patterns highlighted along the fingers, particularly on the thumb and index finger. This overlay is positioned directly over the actual hand, suggesting real-time scanning. Biometric scanning is a common feature in futuristic security systems, and the inclusion of this element reinforces the sci-fi theme. The scan includes fine details like ridges and valleys typical of fingerprint recognition, indicating a high level of detail in the simulation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laptop screen no longer shows financial charts or world maps. Instead, it displays a sweeping, illuminated cityscape at night, featuring towering skyscrapers with glowing windows and neon lights. Notable buildings resemble iconic structures like the Empire State Building, but with futuristic enhancements such as flying vehicles and digital overlays. The sky is clear with a few clouds, and the overall scene has a cinematic quality typical of sci-fi urban environments. This contrasts sharply with the original financial data seen in Image A, confirming a complete thematic shift to a futuristic city view.",

      "question": "Does the laptop’s futuristic skyline display feature sharp, clear, and highly detailed graphics with no visible pixelation or blur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The laptop screen in Image B presents a highly polished and visually rich image of a futuristic city. The buildings are rendered with crisp edges, detailed textures, and dynamic lighting effects. There is no visible pixelation or blurring; instead, the image appears smooth and professional, likely due to high-resolution rendering. Even the distant structures maintain clarity, and the reflections on glass surfaces are well-defined. This level of detail suggests either a high-quality digital illustration or a CGI render designed to look realistic and immersive. Given the context of a sci-fi-themed image, such pristine visuals are intentional to enhance the futuristic feel.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the smartphone and laptop in Image B exhibit a cohesive sci-fi aesthetic. They use a dominant blue color scheme with glowing lines, digital fonts, and futuristic UI elements such as floating data nodes and holographic effects. The smartphone’s interface includes sleek, minimalist gauges and animated data streams, while the laptop shows a cybernetic cityscape with integrated HUD-style overlays. Both devices incorporate biometric scanning (on the hand) and augmented reality-like projections, reinforcing a unified theme of advanced technology. This consistency in visual language—color, lighting, and interactive elements—suggests a deliberate design choice to create a harmonious futuristic environment.",
