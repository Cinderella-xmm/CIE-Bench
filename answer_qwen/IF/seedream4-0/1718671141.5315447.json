      "question": "Does the building now feature visible brass gears integrated into its exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building has a distinct steampunk aesthetic. The exterior is adorned with multiple large, circular brass-colored gears that are clearly visible and appear to be structural or decorative elements integrated into the building's surface. These gears are consistent with the design language of steampunk architecture, which often incorporates mechanical components as part of the visual theme. Based on this visual evidence, it is clear that brass gears are present and integrated into the building’s exterior.",

      "question": "Are there copper-colored funnel-shaped structures present on the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows several pipe-like structures protruding from the building, particularly on the sides. These structures have a copper-like coloration and a funnel or chimney-like shape, consistent with industrial steam vents or exhaust pipes commonly found in steampunk designs. Their placement and form suggest they serve both functional and aesthetic purposes, contributing to the overall mechanical theme. Therefore, copper-colored funnel-shaped structures are indeed present.",

      "question": "Has the original glass dome been replaced with a dome featuring intricate metalwork patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the building features a dome made of dark metal with ornate, detailed patterns, including filigree and mechanical motifs. This contrasts sharply with the original transparent glass dome seen in Image A. The new dome is not transparent but instead appears solid and decorative, constructed from metal with elaborate designs. This indicates a clear replacement of the original glass dome with one featuring intricate metalwork.",

      "question": "Is the moon in the sky replaced by one or more giant clock faces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B shows a large celestial body resembling the moon, but superimposed around it are multiple floating clock faces. These clocks are large, with Roman numerals and hands, and appear to be suspended in the sky. While the moon itself is still visible behind them, the presence of these oversized clock faces suggests a symbolic or surreal transformation where time is visually emphasized. Thus, although the moon remains, it is partially obscured and augmented by the addition of giant clock faces, effectively replacing its dominance in the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are rivets visibly present on the clock faces and/or the building's exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the building’s exterior is covered in small, regularly spaced metallic rivets, especially along the seams and edges of the panels, which is characteristic of industrial or steampunk design. However, the clock faces themselves, while detailed, do not show rivets; they appear smooth with only hour markers and hands. Rivets are clearly visible on the building’s structure but not on the clock faces. Therefore, rivets are present on the building's exterior but not on the clock faces.",

      "question": "Is there visible steam or vapor emitting from parts of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one of the copper-colored pipes on the right side of the building emits a plume of white vapor or steam, rising into the night sky. This detail aligns with the steampunk theme, where steam-powered machinery is implied through visual cues like smoke or steam. The presence of this vapor confirms active mechanical operation, reinforcing the industrial aesthetic. Thus, visible steam or vapor is indeed present.",

      "question": "Is the reflection of the transformed building clearly visible in the water below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water surface in front of the building in Image B is calm and reflective, mirroring the structure with high clarity. The reflection includes the detailed gearwork, the dome, the pipes, and even the glowing lights from within the building. The symmetry between the actual building and its reflection is strong, indicating that the water acts as a mirror. Therefore, the reflection of the transformed building is clearly visible.",
