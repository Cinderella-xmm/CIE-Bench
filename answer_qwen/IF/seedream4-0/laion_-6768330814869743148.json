      "question": "Are the pastries depicted with exaggerated, bright colors and bold outlines characteristic of pop art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries are rendered with highly saturated, non-naturalistic colors—such as vivid oranges, reds, and yellows—and are outlined with thick, black lines that emphasize their shapes. These stylistic choices align closely with the visual language of pop art, which often features bold outlines, flat color fields, and exaggerated forms to create a graphic, stylized effect. Pop art frequently draws from commercial imagery and consumer culture, using vibrant colors and simplified forms to evoke mass-produced objects in an artistic context. The depiction of the pastries here reflects this aesthetic by transforming them into stylized icons rather than realistic representations. This is consistent with artists like Roy Lichtenstein or Andy Warhol, who used similar techniques.",

      "question": "Do the bread slices feature bold outlines and vivid, non-naturalistic colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bread slices are clearly defined with thick, black outlines that separate them from the background and other elements, enhancing their visual impact. Their colors are not natural—instead of typical brown or beige tones, they are rendered in bright orange and red hues with high saturation. These characteristics—bold outlines and unnatural coloration—are hallmarks of a stylized, pop-art-inspired approach. Natural bread would have more muted, earthy tones, but here the artist has chosen to exaggerate both form and color for artistic effect, making the bread appear more graphic and less realistic.",

      "question": "Are the muffin liners replaced with distinct geometric patterns such as triangles, squares, or other regular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The muffin liners in Image B are not depicted as simple paper wrappers; instead, they are composed of abstract, angular shapes filled with bright colors like blue, yellow, and red. These shapes resemble irregular polygons and sharp angles, suggesting a departure from realistic textures. While they do not strictly follow a repeating pattern of triangles or squares, they are constructed from geometric forms that give the appearance of stylized, fragmented patterns. This transformation aligns with the overall pop-art style seen in the image, where everyday objects are reimagined through abstract, geometric design. Thus, although the pattern isn't uniform, the use of geometric shapes is evident.",

      "question": "Are the wooden trays replaced with a checkerboard pattern of alternating colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden trays that originally held the pastries are no longer rendered in wood texture or natural tones. Instead, they are depicted with a black-and-white checkerboard pattern, which alternates between solid black and white squares. This stark, geometric design replaces the original wooden appearance entirely. Checkerboard patterns are commonly used in pop art and modern graphic design to create visual rhythm and contrast. The replacement of natural materials with such a pattern is a deliberate stylistic choice to enhance the image's graphic quality, reinforcing the pop-art aesthetic. Therefore, the trays have indeed been transformed into a checkerboard motif.",

      "question": "Have the background cups been replaced with abstract, colorful, non-representational shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background area that previously contained stacks of white cups (as seen in Image A) is now filled with a vibrant array of abstract shapes. These include circles, rectangles, and irregular forms in bright colors such as yellow, blue, red, and green. There is no attempt to represent actual cups; instead, the space is occupied by non-representational, geometric patterns that serve as a decorative backdrop. This shift from realistic objects to abstract forms is consistent with the pop-art influence, where familiar items are deconstructed and reinterpreted through color and shape. The absence of recognizable cup forms and the presence of purely abstract elements confirm that the background has been transformed into a non-representational composition.",
