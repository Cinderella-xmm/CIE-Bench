      "question": "Has a small husky been added to the image, positioned close behind the skating child?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small husky is visible directly behind the child who is snowboarding. The dog appears to be running on the snow, with its body aligned in a way that suggests it is following the child closely. Based on visual cues such as the dog's posture, size relative to the child, and positioning in the scene, it is clear that a husky has been added. The presence of the dog is not present in typical snowboarding scenes unless explicitly included, and here it is clearly an added element due to its placement and lack of interaction with the environment (e.g., no tracks or disturbed snow indicating prior movement). This supports the conclusion that a husky has indeed been added.",

      "question": "Has the snowy mountain at the top left been replaced with a minimalist, futuristic, transparent ski dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background at the top left shows a large, dome-shaped structure made of transparent material, likely glass or acrylic, with a metallic frame. This structure is clearly not a natural mountain but rather a man-made architectural feature. It contrasts sharply with the natural snowy mountains seen in Image A, where the landscape is dominated by rugged peaks and pine trees. The dome’s design—smooth, curved, and modern—is consistent with futuristic or minimalist architecture. Given that this structure replaces what was previously a mountain range, it confirms that the original terrain has been digitally altered to include this new element.",

      "question": "Is the husky positioned appropriately so it appears to be closely trailing the skating child?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The husky in Image B is located just behind the child, maintaining a consistent distance and orientation that aligns with the direction of motion. Its legs are captured mid-stride, suggesting forward movement, and its head is turned slightly toward the child, which enhances the impression of following. The dog’s shadow and position relative to the snowboarder suggest it is moving parallel to the child, which is plausible for a dog trailing a snowboarder. However, there is no visible trail or disturbance in the snow between the child and the dog, which might make the addition seem slightly artificial. Despite this minor issue, the overall positioning and alignment give the impression that the husky is appropriately placed to appear as if it is closely trailing the child.",

      "question": "Does the new ski dome feature a minimalist design with futuristic elements and appear transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ski dome in Image B is characterized by a smooth, spherical shape with a grid-like framework supporting a translucent surface. The transparency allows the sky and surrounding landscape to be visible through it, confirming its see-through nature. The clean lines, absence of ornamentation, and use of geometric forms reflect a minimalist aesthetic. Additionally, the materials and form suggest advanced technology or futuristic architecture, commonly associated with concept designs in modern or sci-fi environments. These features collectively support the conclusion that the dome is both minimalist and futuristic in design.",

      "question": "Do the added elements (husky and ski dome) blend seamlessly into the image without disrupting the scene's realism or original composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the husky and ski dome are well-integrated visually, their inclusion introduces some inconsistencies that affect realism. The husky, although positioned logically, lacks realistic snow interaction—there are no footprints or displaced snow around it, which would normally be expected when a dog runs on snow. Similarly, the ski dome, while visually striking, appears out of place in a natural alpine setting; its modern design contrasts sharply with the surrounding wilderness, making it stand out rather than blend in. The lighting on the dome also seems inconsistent with the natural sunlight, suggesting digital enhancement. While the additions are plausible in concept, they do not fully integrate into the scene’s original composition, creating a noticeable disruption in realism.",
