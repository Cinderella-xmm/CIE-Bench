      "question": "Have the cheetahs' leg joints been replaced with polished brass pistons and gears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs' legs exhibit mechanical components that are clearly not natural. The joints of their legs are constructed from polished brass-colored metal parts, including visible pistons and gears, which are characteristic of steampunk-style machinery. These elements are integrated into the limbs in a way that mimics biological joints but with metallic articulation. This is consistent with the visual style of mechanical animals in speculative fiction or fantasy art. Based on this detailed observation, it is evident that the leg joints have been replaced with mechanical parts.",

      "question": "Has the cheetahs' spotted fur been partially replaced with tooled leather and copper plating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs' bodies show areas where natural fur has been replaced by artificial materials. Specifically, sections of their backs and shoulders are covered with brown, textured material resembling tooled leather, secured with rivets. Additionally, copper-colored plating with gear-like designs is visible along the sides and chest. These materials are consistent with steampunk aesthetics, combining organic forms with industrial elements. This contrasts sharply with natural fur patterns, confirming that the fur has indeed been partially replaced.",

      "question": "Have the cheetahs' eyes been replaced with glowing amber lenses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the cheetahs' eyes emit a distinct orange glow, unlike the natural eye color seen in real cheetahs. The pupils appear to be replaced with circular, luminous amber orbs that resemble mechanical lenses. This glowing effect is consistent with artificial lighting or internal illumination typical in cybernetic or robotic creatures. Given that the rest of the image features mechanical enhancements, the glowing amber eyes align with the theme of technological integration. Therefore, the eyes have been replaced with glowing amber lenses.",

      "question": "Are there towering, fantastical clockwork structures visible in the distant savanna horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features large, intricate structures that resemble clockwork towers with multiple gears, dials, and spires. These buildings are highly stylized and fantastical, incorporating elements like giant clocks and mechanical frameworks. They stand prominently against the sky and are positioned in the distance, appearing to rise from the savanna landscape. Their design is not found in nature or real-world architecture, indicating they are fictional constructs. Thus, these are indeed towering, fantastical clockwork structures visible on the horizon.",

      "question": "Is the sky streaked with coppery clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B displays a dramatic sunset scene with clouds that have a warm, reddish-orange hue. These colors are reminiscent of copper tones, especially when combined with the golden light reflecting off the clouds. The gradient from deep blue to fiery orange suggests a time of day near dusk, and the cloud formations are tinged with metallic-like warmth, reinforcing the coppery appearance. This visual effect enhances the steampunk aesthetic of the image. Therefore, the sky is indeed streaked with coppery clouds.",
