      "question": "Has the worker been transformed into a chibi-style 3D cartoon character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B exhibits exaggerated proportions typical of chibi art style, such as a large head relative to the body, simplified facial features, and rounded limbs. The rendering is three-dimensional with smooth surfaces, soft shading, and stylized lighting, indicating a 3D model rather than a 2D illustration. These visual cues—combined with the cartoonish aesthetic and lack of realistic human anatomy—confirm that the worker has been rendered as a chibi-style 3D cartoon character. This transformation is consistent with digital animation or 3D modeling techniques used in stylized representations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D character wear a yellow hard hat, a fluorescent yellow shirt, and an orange reflective vest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the character’s attire, the helmet is clearly bright yellow, matching standard construction safety gear. The shirt beneath the vest is a vivid yellow, consistent with fluorescent safety clothing. The outer layer is an orange vest with white reflective stripes, which aligns with standard high-visibility workwear. These elements are visually distinct and identifiable, and their color choices match real-world construction safety standards. Therefore, all described clothing items are present and accurately depicted.",

      "question": "Is the chibi-style 3D character placed at the center of a low-poly construction scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character is positioned centrally within the frame, drawing immediate attention. The surrounding environment includes geometrically simplified structures such as gray blocks resembling concrete slabs and a crane with angular, faceted surfaces—hallmarks of low-poly modeling. These elements suggest a stylized, minimalist construction site designed for visual clarity and aesthetic coherence. The overall composition places the character as the focal point amidst this low-poly setting, confirming its central placement in such a scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a simplified light gray plane with a small crane model included?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background consists of a flat, uniform light gray surface that lacks texture or detail, consistent with a simplified or abstracted ground plane often used in 3D renderings to emphasize the subject. In the distance, there is a clearly visible crane model with a tower and boom structure, rendered in a stylized manner matching the low-poly aesthetic. Its size relative to the character indicates it is a 'small' model in scale within the scene. Thus, both the background plane and the inclusion of the crane model align with the description.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a 1:1 composition ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "The image appears to be square in format, with equal width and height, which is characteristic of a 1:1 aspect ratio. This is supported by the symmetrical framing of the character and background elements, where the horizon line and object placements are balanced across the canvas. Additionally, the absence of any visible cropping or distortion suggests a deliberate square composition, commonly used in social media or digital illustrations. Therefore, the image maintains a 1:1 composition ratio.",
