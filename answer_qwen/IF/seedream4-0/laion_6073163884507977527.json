      "question": "Is there a clear glass dome covering the entire scene, enclosing the house, lake, and surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a transparent, rounded glass dome is clearly visible, encasing the entire miniature scene. The dome sits atop a dark wooden base and extends over all elements including the house, the lake, the bridge, and surrounding vegetation. The curvature of the glass is evident from reflections and refractions of light, especially around the edges. The dome appears to be sealed, suggesting it functions as a terrarium or display case. This is consistent with common decorative dioramas where such domes are used to protect and highlight intricate scenes. Based on visual cues like the reflection patterns and the containment of all elements within a single enclosed space, it is clear that the dome fully covers the scene.",

      "question": "Are there visible mossy green pathways leading toward or around the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are distinct green moss-like textures forming narrow, winding paths. These pathways originate from the edge of the lake and extend toward the house, particularly along the left side and near the entrance steps. The texture and color resemble natural moss, commonly used in miniature landscapes for aesthetic appeal. These pathways appear carefully placed to guide the viewer’s eye through the scene. In contrast, Image A does not show any such defined pathways—only loose ground cover and scattered foliage. The addition of these mossy trails in Image B enhances the sense of depth and movement within the scene, indicating intentional design choices. Therefore, based on visual evidence and typical landscape modeling practices, mossy green pathways are present.",

      "question": "Are there multiple tiny shrubs added around the house and along the pathways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays several small, bushy green elements scattered throughout the scene. These are positioned near the base of the house, along the edges of the pathways, and around the lake. Their size, shape, and density suggest they are miniature shrubs, likely made from artificial moss or similar materials used in diorama construction. These shrubs contribute to a more natural and detailed environment. Comparing this to Image A, which lacks such dense, organized plantings, it's evident that additional shrubs were introduced in Image B. The presence of multiple shrubs aligns with common landscaping techniques in model scenes to create visual interest and realism. Thus, based on both visual analysis and contextual knowledge of diorama design, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Is there a lake with a shiny, silver-colored surface present in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a body of water is clearly visible in the foreground, situated between the house and the base of the dome. Its surface reflects light in a way that suggests it is glossy and possibly metallic or coated to mimic water under illumination. The shimmering effect, combined with ripples and highlights, gives it a silvery appearance. This is typical of artificial lakes in miniature scenes, often created using reflective materials like resin or mirrored surfaces. In Image A, no such water feature exists—only dry ground and vegetation. The inclusion of this lake in Image B significantly alters the scene's atmosphere, adding a serene, almost magical quality. Given the visual characteristics and common practices in crafting dioramas, the lake has a shiny, silver-colored surface.",

      "question": "Are there delicate fairy lights visible, wrapped around the miniature trees or foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features thin, glowing strands of light that wind around the tree trunks and through the foliage. These lights emit a warm, golden glow and are arranged in a manner typical of fairy lights used in decorative settings. They are particularly noticeable around the red-leafed tree on the left and near the right-side bare tree, enhancing the enchanting ambiance. These lights are not present in Image A, where the scene is lit uniformly without any embedded illumination. The addition of fairy lights in Image B serves both aesthetic and functional purposes—creating a cozy, magical atmosphere. Based on their appearance and placement, these are indeed delicate fairy lights.",

      "question": "Is there a small bridge crossing the lake and connecting to the entrance of the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small arched bridge made of white material (likely plastic or painted wood) spans the lake. It connects the far side of the water to the front steps of the house, allowing a path across the lake. The bridge is detailed with railings and follows a gentle curve, typical of miniature garden bridges. This structure is absent in Image A, where the house is directly accessible via steps without any water obstacle. The inclusion of the bridge in Image B adds a narrative element, suggesting access to the house across a scenic water feature. Given its visibility and structural consistency with known miniature models, the bridge is clearly present.",
