      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit soft watercolor tones with blended color transitions and a lack of harsh lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays characteristics typical of watercolor art, such as soft, diffused color transitions and gentle gradients. The edges between colors are not sharp or defined, which is consistent with the way watercolors blend on paper. For example, the greenery in the background has a misty, layered appearance with no hard outlines, and the sky blends into the trees seamlessly. The rendering of light and shadow also lacks abrupt contrasts, further supporting the watercolor aesthetic. This style is distinct from digital or photographic imagery, where edges and details are typically sharper. Based on these visual cues and common knowledge about watercolor techniques, it is clear that the image uses this artistic medium.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the woman and child rendered in a cartoon style with noticeably enlarged eyes and exaggerated, playful hand gestures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, both the woman and the child have features that align with cartoon aesthetics. Their eyes are disproportionately large compared to their facial features, a hallmark of anime or cartoon character design. Additionally, their hand gestures are stylized and exaggerated—such as the woman’s open palm reaching toward the child and the child’s hands raised near her face—emphasizing emotional expression rather than realism. These stylistic choices are common in animated or illustrated media to convey personality and emotion more vividly. Comparing this to realistic depictions (as seen in Image A), the proportions and expressions here are clearly simplified and dramatized for visual appeal, confirming the cartoon style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are additional floral elements (such as flowers or foliage) visibly added to the background to increase liveliness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the edited image, there are decorative floral elements placed around the border of the artwork—specifically, small clusters of flowers and leaves in the top-left and bottom-right corners. These elements are not present in the original photograph (Image A), where the background consists only of natural garden scenery without such embellishments. These added flowers appear to be part of the artistic framing, enhancing the whimsical and cheerful mood of the piece. Their placement and style suggest they were intentionally included to complement the watercolor theme and add visual interest, thus increasing the overall liveliness of the composition.",

      "question": "Is the image enclosed by a visible warm-toned wooden border that frames the artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image is presented within a prominent, warm-toned wooden frame that surrounds the entire artwork. The frame has a natural wood texture and a golden-brown hue, giving it a classic, rustic appearance. It is clearly visible and forms a distinct boundary around the illustration, suggesting it is meant to be displayed as a finished piece of art. This type of framing is common in traditional paintings and illustrations, especially those intended for home decor. In contrast, the original image (Image A) lacks any such frame, appearing as a standalone photograph. The presence of the frame in the edited version indicates an intentional presentation choice.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition, including the frame and color scheme, appear suitable for display on a rustic shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition of the edited image—featuring a warm-toned wooden frame, soft watercolor tones, and floral accents—aligns well with rustic or cottage-style interior design. The color palette includes earthy greens, browns, and soft pinks, which harmonize with natural materials commonly found in rustic settings. The frame itself, with its simple yet elegant wood finish, complements wooden shelves or furniture. Furthermore, the subject matter—a tender moment between a woman and a child in a garden—evokes warmth and nostalgia, making it emotionally resonant in a home environment. Given these factors, the artwork would fit aesthetically and contextually on a rustic shelf, enhancing the cozy ambiance of such a space.",
