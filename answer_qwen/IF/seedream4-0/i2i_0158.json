      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the topmost view shows the car from a front-three-quarter angle, which includes a clear and unobstructed view of the front fascia. The headlights, grille with the Mustang emblem, bumper, and front fenders are all distinctly visible. This perspective is typical in automotive photography to highlight the vehicle's design features such as the aggressive styling of the grille and the LED lighting elements. Given that the car is positioned at an angle but still allows full visibility of the front, including both headlamps and the central grille, it can be concluded that the front view is indeed clearly visible. There are no visual obstructions or distortions that would impede this clarity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The middle image in Image B presents the car in a side profile view, showing the left side of the vehicle. The entire length of the car’s body is visible, including the wheel arches, doors, windows, and side mirrors. The lines of the car’s silhouette, such as the character line running along the side and the sculpted haunches over the rear wheels, are clearly defined. This side view is well-composed with adequate spacing and lighting, allowing for a detailed inspection of the car’s lateral design. Based on standard automotive presentation practices, a clean side profile like this is essential for showcasing proportions and aerodynamic design, and here it is presented without any overlap or obstruction. Therefore, the left side view is clearly visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom image in Image B displays the car from a rear-three-quarter angle, emphasizing the back end. Key rear design elements such as the taillights, trunk lid with the Mustang logo, dual exhaust outlets, rear bumper, and spoiler are all clearly visible. Although it is not a direct rear view (which would be straight from behind), the angle provides sufficient detail of the rear profile, including the curvature of the roofline and the integration of the tail lights into the overall design. In automotive marketing, such angles are commonly used because they offer a balanced representation of both the rear and side profiles. Since all major rear features are identifiable and well-lit, the rear view is considered clearly visible.",

      "question": "Are the three views of the car presented in a non-overlapping manner, ensuring they are distinct and clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three views of the car are arranged vertically — front-three-quarter, side, and rear-three-quarter — each separated by ample white space. There is no physical overlap between the images; each one occupies its own horizontal band within the composition. This layout ensures that each view is isolated and easily distinguishable. The consistent background (pure white) further enhances contrast and clarity, preventing visual confusion. Such a structured arrangement is standard in technical or promotional automotive presentations where clarity and separation of views are crucial. Thus, the views are presented in a non-overlapping and distinct manner.",

      "question": "Does the overall presentation of the combined three-view image align with the standards suitable for car magazines or showroom flyers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presentation in Image B follows established conventions used in automotive advertising and publications. The use of high-resolution, clean studio-style renders with neutral backgrounds, precise lighting, and multiple angles (front, side, rear) is typical of professional car magazine spreads or showroom materials. Each view is professionally composed, highlighting key design elements such as the grille, wheels, and taillights. The absence of distracting elements, uniform lighting, and clear visibility of all angles meet industry standards for visual communication in marketing contexts. Furthermore, the consistent color tone and sharpness suggest a polished, commercial-grade output. Therefore, the presentation aligns well with the quality expected in car magazines or showroom flyers.",
