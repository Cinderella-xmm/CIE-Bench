      "question": "Does the figurine appear to be made of polished wood, with visible wood grain and a smooth, reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B displays a rich, warm brown coloration with distinct linear patterns consistent with natural wood grain. These patterns are particularly visible on the ears, face, and body, suggesting the material is wood rather than plastic or ceramic. The surface has a glossy finish that reflects light subtly, indicating it has been polished. This reflective quality, combined with the visible grain texture, supports the conclusion that the figurine is crafted from polished wood.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black and white areas of the dog's fur represented using contrasting natural wood tones (dark vs. light)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the areas corresponding to 'black' and 'white' fur on the dog are rendered using different shades of wood. The dark regions, such as parts of the head and back, use deep, rich brown tones resembling darker wood species or stained sections. In contrast, the lighter areas—like the stripe down the center of the face and the muzzle—are made from pale, almost cream-colored wood, which provides a strong visual contrast. This use of varying natural wood tones effectively simulates the appearance of black and white fur without paint or synthetic materials.",

      "question": "Do the figurine’s contours appear smooth and rounded, avoiding sharp or angular edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall shape of the figurine in Image B features soft, flowing lines. The limbs, head, and body all have gently curved forms typical of stylized animal carvings. There are no abrupt angles or harsh transitions between body parts; instead, the design emphasizes a plump, cartoonish aesthetic common in decorative wooden figures. This suggests intentional craftsmanship focused on creating a smooth, approachable silhouette.",

      "question": "Are facial features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth enhanced with visible fine carved lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the figurine’s face in Image B, the eyes are deeply recessed and have defined edges, giving them depth. The nose is sculpted with subtle curvature but lacks intricate carving lines. However, the mouth area includes fine engraved lines representing whiskers, and the outline of the lips appears slightly incised. While not highly detailed, these elements do include small carved details that enhance facial expression. Therefore, some facial features are indeed enhanced with visible fine lines, especially around the mouth and eyes.",

      "question": "Is the figurine placed on a minimalist wooden platform that matches the carving style and material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine rests on a flat, rectangular wooden base that shares the same light brown tone and grain pattern as the figurine itself. The base has clean, simple edges and no ornamental detailing, fitting a minimalist aesthetic. Its material and finish align closely with the figurine’s construction, suggesting it was designed as a cohesive unit. This consistency in material and style reinforces the idea that the platform complements the carving both functionally and artistically.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image emphasize craftsmanship through natural wood textures, subtle lighting, and a muted color palette compared to the original bright appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B highlights the natural beauty of wood through its prominent grain patterns, warm tones, and polished surface. The lighting is soft and directional, casting gentle shadows that accentuate the three-dimensional form and texture of the carving. The color palette is dominated by earthy browns and creams, which are more subdued than the vibrant whites and blacks seen in the original image (Image A). This shift toward natural materials and understated presentation underscores an emphasis on artisanal craftsmanship. Compared to the original’s bright, possibly synthetic look, this version leans into organic aesthetics.",
