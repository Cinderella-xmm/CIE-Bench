      "question": "Does the elephant appear as a 3D chibi-style desktop figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in Image B is stylized with exaggerated proportions typical of chibi art—large head, small body, and simplified features such as round eyes and a cute, cartoonish expression. The overall form is compact and rounded, consistent with chibi design principles. It is enclosed under a transparent dome on a base, which is common for collectible desktop figurines. These visual cues, combined with the knowledge that chibi style is often used in toy and decorative items, support the conclusion that this is a 3D chibi-style desktop figurine.",

      "question": "Is the elephant still depicted in its original grass-eating pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is shown with its trunk curled upward, holding green grass in its mouth, mimicking the act of eating. This posture closely resembles the natural feeding behavior seen in real elephants, including the one in Image A. Although the scale and context are different (a figurine vs. a live animal), the pose—trunk raised with grass being consumed—is preserved. By comparing both images, we observe that while the setting has changed from a natural environment to a miniature diorama, the core action of grass-eating remains intact in terms of gesture and intent.",

      "question": "Does the base mimic muddy terrain with \"Jungle Friend\" engraved around the edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the figurine in Image B is textured to resemble soil or mud, with small clumps and uneven surface details suggesting natural ground. Green tufts of grass are placed sporadically across it, enhancing the jungle-like terrain impression. Around the outer rim of the base, the words 'Jungle Friend' are clearly visible and embossed into the material, indicating intentional engraving. This matches the description exactly, combining both visual evidence and textual confirmation.",

      "question": "Are the materials used matte polymer clay for the figurine and a transparent acrylic dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine has a smooth, non-reflective surface with soft edges and uniform coloration, characteristic of matte polymer clay commonly used in handcrafted models. The dome covering the figurine is clear, seamless, and slightly reflective, consistent with high-quality acrylic or glass used in display domes. While definitive material identification requires physical testing, the visual properties—such as the lack of shine on the elephant and the clarity and curvature of the dome—align strongly with known characteristics of matte polymer clay and transparent acrylic. Therefore, based on visual cues and common manufacturing practices for such collectibles, this assessment is reasonable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits key elements of professional product photography: clean background, even lighting, shallow depth of field (blurred surroundings), and central framing of the subject. The object is presented clearly against a neutral backdrop, highlighting its details without distraction. This setup is typical for showcasing collectibles or decorative items for retail or promotional purposes. The focus is sharp on the figurine, emphasizing texture, color, and craftsmanship—all hallmarks of product photography intended to appeal to consumers.",
