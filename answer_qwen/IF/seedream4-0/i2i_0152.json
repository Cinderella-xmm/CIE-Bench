        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By visually inspecting Image B, the word 'Warm' is clearly visible in white, bold, sans-serif font located in the upper-left corner of the image. This placement is consistent with common design practices for branding or thematic messaging in advertisements, where key words are placed in corners to draw attention without obstructing the main subject. The text is legible and distinct against the darker background of the kitchen wall, ensuring it stands out. Based on visual cues alone, the presence of 'Warm' at the top left is confirmed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Start' appears in white, bold, sans-serif font positioned in the lower-right corner of the image. Its placement is symmetrical to the 'Warm' text in the upper-left, creating a balanced visual composition. The text is clearly readable and contrasts well with the wooden surface beneath it. This positioning is typical in promotional imagery to guide viewer attention toward action-oriented messages. Visual inspection confirms the presence of 'Start' in the bottom right.",

      "question": "Does the image maintain a clean and simple design style suitable for a morning coffee brand ad?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall design of Image B is minimalistic and focused. The central subject—a steaming cup of coffee on a wooden table—is well-lit and sharply defined, drawing immediate attention. The background is softly blurred (bokeh effect), which reduces distractions and emphasizes the product. The addition of only two textual elements ('Warm' and 'Start') in clean, modern fonts contributes to simplicity without clutter. The color palette—warm browns, whites, and soft lighting—evokes a cozy, inviting morning atmosphere. These elements align with typical branding aesthetics for morning coffee, where clarity, warmth, and simplicity are key. Therefore, the image maintains a clean and simple design appropriate for such an ad.",

      "question": "Are the fonts and colors of \"Warm\" and \"Start\" appropriate for the clean design style of the morning coffee ad?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fonts used for both 'Warm' and 'Start' are bold, sans-serif, and white, which are standard choices in modern advertising for readability and elegance. White text on darker backgrounds ensures high contrast and visibility without overwhelming the image. The choice of sans-serif fonts aligns with contemporary design trends that favor clarity and simplicity. Additionally, the color white complements the warm tones of the coffee and wood, reinforcing a clean, fresh, and inviting feel. These typographic choices enhance rather than detract from the minimalist aesthetic, making them appropriate for a morning coffee brand ad.",

      "question": "Do the placements and designs of \"Warm\" and \"Start\" effectively contribute to evoking a morning coffee vibe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The placement of 'Warm' in the top left and 'Start' in the bottom right creates a visual flow that guides the viewer’s eye across the image, mimicking the natural progression of a morning routine—beginning with warmth and leading into the start of the day. The words themselves are emotionally resonant: 'Warm' connects directly to the sensory experience of hot coffee, while 'Start' suggests the beginning of a new day. Combined with the steam rising from the cup and the sunlight streaming through the window, these textual elements reinforce the theme of a comforting, energizing morning ritual. The design choices thus work synergistically with the visual content to evoke a strong morning coffee vibe.",
