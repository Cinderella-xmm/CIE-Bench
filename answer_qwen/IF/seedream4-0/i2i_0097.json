      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image displays a white plate with a spoon centered on it, similar to the original, but now includes text at the top that reads 'Master Chef Final Round'. The addition of this text, along with its placement and font style, suggests a deliberate design choice typical of promotional materials or posters. The layout is clean, with ample white space around the central image and text, which is a common characteristic of poster design. This formatting elevates the image from a simple photograph to a structured visual announcement, aligning with the conventions of a poster used for events or competitions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the upper portion of the image, the words 'Master Chef' are clearly visible in a large, bold serif font. This font size and style are consistent with how titles are typically presented in posters or promotional materials. The positioning at the top center further supports its role as a primary heading or title. Given the context of a cooking competition theme, 'Master Chef' is a well-known brand name associated with culinary contests, reinforcing its identity as a title.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Below the main title 'Master Chef', the phrase 'Final Round' appears in a slightly smaller but still prominent font. Its placement directly beneath the main title and its typographic hierarchy (smaller than the title but still clear) indicate it functions as a subtitle. In promotional design, subtitles often provide additional context—here, specifying the stage of the competition. This use of layered text is standard in event posters, where the main title is followed by supplementary information like round or category.",

      "question": "Does the poster include the plate and spoon from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central visual element of the poster is a white circular plate with a metallic spoon placed vertically in the center. This matches the content of the original image exactly, confirming that the core imagery has been preserved. The plate and spoon are rendered with the same lighting, proportions, and positioning as in the original, suggesting they were directly incorporated into the new design. Thus, despite the added text, the key objects from the original image remain intact.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The poster uses several design elements that contribute to a cooking competition theme. The font choice for 'Master Chef' is formal and elegant, reminiscent of branding used in high-profile culinary shows. The color scheme is minimalistic—white background with black text and silver-toned utensils—which conveys sophistication and professionalism, commonly associated with gourmet or competitive cooking environments. The clean layout and emphasis on a single utensil (a spoon) subtly evoke the idea of precision and focus in cooking. These stylistic choices collectively reinforce the theme of a prestigious culinary event.",
