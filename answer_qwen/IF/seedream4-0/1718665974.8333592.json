      "question": "Does the image feature a steampunk-themed fantasy style with visible mechanical and industrial elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image showcases a character dressed in an elaborate outfit composed of brass gears, leather armor, and metallic components, all hallmarks of the steampunk aesthetic. The wings are constructed from metal with intricate gearwork, reinforcing the mechanical theme. Additionally, the background includes airships and towering brass structures, which are typical elements in steampunk-inspired settings. These visual cues—mechanical design, industrial materials, and retro-futuristic architecture—are consistent with the steampunk genre. The overall color palette and design language further support this classification.",

      "question": "Is the figure wearing intricate brass gears and leather armor as part of their attire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure's outfit is clearly detailed with brass-colored gears integrated into the chest plate, shoulder guards, and other parts of the armor. Leather-like material forms the base of the clothing, with ornate stitching and metallic embellishments. This combination of brass machinery and leather is characteristic of steampunk fashion, where functional-looking gear mechanisms are fused with rugged, vintage-style garments. The visual evidence strongly supports that these materials are present and central to the character’s design.",

      "question": "Have the wings been replaced with clockwork wings featuring mechanical details such as gears and metal frameworks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in the image are not organic or natural in appearance; instead, they are made of metal with visible gears, cogs, and articulated joints, resembling clockwork mechanisms. The structure mimics bird-like wings but uses mechanical components to create motion and form. This transformation from biological to mechanical wings aligns with the steampunk motif of blending nature with industrial technology. The presence of interlocking gears and riveted metal frames confirms the clockwork nature of the wings.",

      "question": "Are there elaborate patterned robes present in the figure's outfit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure wears a long coat or robe that features intricate decorative patterns, particularly along the edges and sleeves. These patterns include swirling motifs and embossed designs, often seen in historical or fantasy-inspired textiles. The robe combines with armored elements but retains its ornamental quality, suggesting it is both functional and ceremonial. The level of detail in the fabric’s design indicates that it is indeed elaborately patterned, fitting within the grandiose aesthetic of the scene.",

      "question": "Does the glowing orb at the center of the chest contain a visible clock face with hour markers and hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the center of the figure’s chest is a glowing circular element that resembles a clock face. It features Roman numerals around its perimeter and two hands indicating time, one longer than the other, consistent with traditional analog clocks. The glow emanating from it adds a mystical or technological aura, but the structural details—including the numerals and hands—are clearly discernible. This confirms that the orb incorporates a functional clock face design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background reveals a sprawling urban environment dominated by tall spires and domes constructed from brass or gold-toned materials, consistent with steampunk architectural styles. Multiple airships, resembling early 20th-century dirigibles, float in the sky above the city. These elements—the metallic towers, the aerial vehicles, and the hazy, sepia-tinted atmosphere—collectively form a fantastical yet industrial cityscape typical of steampunk narratives. The scale and detail suggest a vast, immersive world.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image employs a warm, monochromatic color scheme dominated by browns, golds, and muted oranges, which is characteristic of a sepia tone. This tonal choice evokes an aged, antique feel, reminiscent of old photographs or early 20th-century illustrations. While some areas have slight variations in hue due to lighting (e.g., brighter highlights on metal), the overall palette remains consistent with sepia rendering. This stylistic choice enhances the retro-futuristic ambiance of the steampunk theme.",
