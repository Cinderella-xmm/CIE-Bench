      "question": "Is the subject rendered as a three-dimensional figurine rather than a flat image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is clearly depicted as a three-dimensional figurine. This is evident from the perspective and depth cues such as the visible sides of the dress, the positioning of the limbs, and the way light interacts with the surface—casting subtle shadows and highlights that suggest volume. The figurine appears to be standing upright on a base, with arms and hands positioned naturally, which is characteristic of a sculpted or physical model rather than a two-dimensional representation. Additionally, the presence of a glass display case around the figure reinforces its status as a physical object meant for exhibition. These visual elements, combined with common knowledge about how 3D objects are rendered in realistic scenes (e.g., depth perception, lighting, and shadowing), confirm that this is not a flat image but a volumetric representation.",

      "question": "Does the figurine’s dress feature a visible lace-textured surface with intricate patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress worn by the figurine in Image B displays detailed textures consistent with lace. Specifically, the skirt and bodice sections exhibit fine, openwork patterns typical of lace fabric, including floral motifs and geometric designs. These textures are further emphasized by the way light reflects off the surface, highlighting the delicate structure. The use of ruffles and layered fabric also supports the impression of lace-like material. From a world knowledge standpoint, lace is commonly used in historical fashion, particularly in aristocratic attire, and the style here aligns with that tradition. The level of detail suggests a high-resolution rendering intended to simulate real textile texture, confirming the presence of lace-like patterning.",

      "question": "Is the figurine mounted on a base that appears to be made of polished wood with gilded scrollwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base supporting the figurine in Image B has a rich, dark brown finish with a glossy sheen, indicative of polished wood. It features ornate gold-colored decorative elements along the edges, including swirling scroll patterns and classical motifs such as acanthus leaves and volutes. These details are consistent with traditional craftsmanship seen in baroque or rococo-style display stands. The combination of wood grain texture, reflective surface, and metallic embellishments strongly suggests a handcrafted wooden base with gilded accents. Based on common knowledge of museum display cases and collectible figurines, such bases are often designed to enhance the aesthetic value of the object they support.",

      "question": "Is the figurine enclosed within a display case that features glass panels and elaborate floral decorations consistent with baroque style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine is indeed housed within a cylindrical display case composed of transparent glass panels supported by a golden frame. The frame itself includes decorative flourishes such as scrolls and rosettes, which are hallmarks of baroque design. While the floral decorations mentioned in the question are not directly visible on the case itself, the surrounding environment features large floral arrangements and ornate wall designs that complement the overall baroque aesthetic. However, the display case itself does not have floral decorations integrated into its structure; instead, it relies on the gold detailing and symmetry typical of baroque architecture. Therefore, while the case is elaborate and stylistically aligned with baroque influences, it lacks actual floral embellishments on the glass or frame.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B showcases an opulent interior with soft pastel hues, primarily in shades of pale blue, pink, and cream. It is adorned with elaborate floral arrangements, symmetrical swags, and curvilinear gold frames—hallmarks of rococo art and design. Rococo style is known for its emphasis on elegance, asymmetry, and naturalistic ornamentation, all of which are present here. The walls are decorated with garlands of flowers and ornamental moldings, creating a sense of luxury and refinement. This aligns perfectly with historical examples of 18th-century French interiors, especially those associated with Marie Antoinette’s era at Versailles. Thus, the visual evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the background is rococo-inspired.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine's attire is predominantly pastel in color, featuring soft pinks, blues, and creams—colors emblematic of Marie Antoinette’s fashion during the late 18th century. The dress includes multiple layers of ruffles, especially at the sleeves and hemline, which were characteristic of aristocratic gowns of that period. Embroidery and lace details are visible across the bodice and skirt, and there appear to be pearl-like embellishments near the collar and shoulder area. These elements collectively reflect the extravagant and highly decorative clothing associated with Marie Antoinette. Historical knowledge confirms that her wardrobe often featured such luxurious fabrics and accessories, making this depiction both visually accurate and thematically appropriate.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the figurine is clearly enclosed within a closed display case. The structure consists of vertical glass panels forming a cylindrical enclosure, allowing full visibility of the figurine while protecting it. The top and bottom edges of the case are framed with ornate golden metalwork, adding to its decorative appeal. The case is sealed, as indicated by the absence of any open doors or gaps, and the reflection on the glass surfaces confirms their transparency and structural integrity. Such display cases are commonly used for preserving valuable or artistic objects, and the design here is consistent with museum-quality presentation. Therefore, the figurine is securely housed within a fully enclosed, glass-paned case.",
