      "question": "Is the hot dog replaced with a model made of red, yellow, and tan LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object that resembles a hot dog is clearly constructed from interlocking plastic bricks, consistent in appearance with LEGO pieces. The colors used—red for the sausage portion, yellow for the bun, and tan for accents—are typical LEGO color choices. The structure is blocky and modular, which is characteristic of LEGO constructions. This contrasts with a real hot dog, which would have smooth textures and organic shapes. Therefore, based on visual cues such as the grid-like surface, uniform brick shapes, and distinct color blocks, it is evident that the hot dog has been replaced with a LEGO model.",

      "question": "Has the original bottle been replaced with a mosaic-style ceramic object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object previously occupied by a glass bottle in Image A is now a spherical, vase-like structure composed of small, colorful tiles arranged in a mosaic pattern. This object lacks the transparent glass and cylindrical shape of the original bottle. Instead, it features a rounded body, narrow neck, and a decorative surface made of geometric tiles, which is characteristic of mosaic ceramics. Given these visual differences, it is clear that the original bottle has been replaced with a mosaic-style ceramic piece.",

      "question": "Does the mosaic ceramic piece feature geometric patterns in red, yellow, and tan colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mosaic ceramic object in Image B is composed of numerous small, square or rectangular tiles arranged in an intricate pattern. The dominant colors visible are red, yellow, and tan (or beige), forming angular and geometric shapes across the surface. These colors are distributed in a non-uniform, artistic fashion, creating a visually dynamic design. This matches the description of geometric patterns using those specific colors, confirming the presence of such a design.",

      "question": "Are both the LEGO hot dog and the mosaic ceramic piece placed on a smooth wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the LEGO hot dog and the mosaic ceramic object are positioned on a flat, light-brown wooden board. The surface appears smooth and polished, consistent with a cutting board or display base. The objects are centrally placed on this base, which provides a stable platform. This is consistent with the placement seen in Image A, where the original items were also on a similar wooden surface. The continuity of the base supports the conclusion that both new objects rest on a smooth wooden base.",

      "question": "Does the LEGO hot dog maintain an elongated, cylindrical shape similar to a real hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although constructed from LEGO bricks, the model retains the overall elongated and cylindrical form of a traditional hot dog. The red section representing the sausage is long and rounded, while the yellow and tan sections mimic the bun’s shape. Despite the blocky texture due to the LEGO construction, the silhouette and proportions closely resemble a real hot dog. This indicates that the designer preserved the essential shape despite the material change.",

      "question": "Does the mosaic ceramic piece have a rounded, artistic form rather than a realistic bottle shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mosaic object in Image B has a bulbous, spherical body with a narrow neck and a flat base, resembling a traditional vase or decorative art piece. It lacks the straight sides, transparency, and cap of a standard beverage bottle. Its form is stylized and artistic, with a focus on aesthetic pattern rather than functional design. This contrasts sharply with the original bottle in Image A, which was tall, cylindrical, and utilitarian. Thus, the mosaic piece is clearly more artistic and rounded than realistic.",
