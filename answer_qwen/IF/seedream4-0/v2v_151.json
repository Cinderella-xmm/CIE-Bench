      "question": "Is the tiger depicted in a chibi-style 3D cartoon figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tiger in Image B exhibits characteristics typical of a chibi-style character, such as an oversized head relative to its body, large expressive eyes, and simplified facial features. The proportions are exaggerated for cuteness, which is a hallmark of chibi art. Additionally, the rendering style is three-dimensional with smooth shading and rounded edges, indicating a 3D model rather than a 2D drawing. These visual cues—combined with common knowledge about chibi aesthetics in anime and digital art—confirm that the tiger is indeed designed in a chibi-style 3D cartoon format.",

      "question": "Does the backdrop feature soft pastel hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B includes cherry blossom trees with light pink flowers, a clear blue sky, and a pathway scattered with delicate pink petals. The color palette consists of gentle tones like soft pinks, pale blues, and muted greens, which are characteristic of pastel hues. These colors create a dreamy, serene atmosphere commonly associated with springtime scenes in animated or stylized environments. Based on these visual elements and general knowledge of color theory and artistic design, the backdrop clearly uses soft pastel hues.",

      "question": "Are there cherry blossom trees and rose petals visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple trees with abundant pink blossoms are visible, consistent with cherry blossom trees (sakura), which are known for their delicate pink flowers and seasonal blooming. Additionally, numerous pink petals are scattered across the ground along the pathway, further supporting the presence of cherry blossoms. While some red roses are also visible in the foreground and near the floral arch, the primary floral elements are cherry blossoms. Rose petals are present but not dominant; however, since the question asks if they are 'visible,' and they are indeed present in the lower right corner and along the path, the answer is affirmative. Thus, both cherry blossom trees and rose petals are visible in the scene.",

      "question": "Is there a romantic floral arch present in the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the background of Image B, there is a prominent archway constructed from intertwined vines and adorned with pink and white flowers, including roses and other blossoms. This structure is positioned centrally along the pathway and serves as a focal point in the composition. Its design, with lush floral decorations and symmetrical form, aligns with the aesthetic of a romantic floral arch often seen in wedding or garden settings. Given this visual evidence and cultural associations with such arches in romantic or celebratory contexts, it is accurate to describe it as a romantic floral arch.",

      "question": "Are the lighting and textures of the environment photorealistic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the overall scene in Image B is highly detailed and visually appealing, the lighting and textures exhibit stylized qualities rather than photorealism. The lighting appears soft and evenly distributed, with minimal harsh shadows, which is typical of animated or digitally rendered scenes. The textures of the grass, pavement, and petals are smooth and slightly idealized, lacking the subtle imperfections found in real-world photography. Furthermore, the vibrant, saturated colors and perfect symmetry suggest artistic enhancement rather than realism. Therefore, despite high-quality rendering, the environment leans toward a stylized, cartoonish aesthetic rather than photorealism.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tiger in Image B is designed with exaggeratedly large eyes, a small snout, and a plump, rounded body—features that are widely recognized as indicators of cuteness in character design. Its posture, holding a skateboard while standing on another, conveys a sense of fun and playfulness. The addition of a military-style cap adds a whimsical touch, enhancing the character's charm without detracting from its playful nature. These design choices align with common principles in children’s animation and collectible toy design, where adorableness and playfulness are key attributes. Thus, the tiger clearly maintains an adorable and playful design.",
