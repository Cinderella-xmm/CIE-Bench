      "question": "Has the dress been transformed into a mosaic-style design using geometric shapes that resemble African tribal art, while retaining the original pattern layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress appears to have undergone a significant transformation. The original fabric pattern in Image A features traditional African geometric designs in earthy tones like blue, orange, and brown, arranged in a symmetrical layout. In contrast, Image B shows the same general shape and placement of patterns but now composed of small, irregularly shaped tiles resembling stained glass or mosaic work. These tiles are brightly colored with sharp edges and lead-line-like borders, mimicking the appearance of a mosaic. While the overall layout of the geometric shapes is preserved—such as the diamond and square motifs—the medium has changed from textile to a mosaic style. This transformation retains the essence of African tribal art through its use of geometric abstraction and vibrant color, but it does so by reinterpreting the material form. Therefore, the dress has indeed been transformed into a mosaic-style design while maintaining the original pattern layout.",

      "question": "Have the beaded necklace and bracelets been replaced with stained glass tile designs featuring vibrant colors and lead-line-like borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The necklace and bracelets in Image B exhibit a striking visual shift from their original form in Image A. In Image A, these accessories are clearly made of multicolored beads arranged in layered, circular patterns typical of African tribal jewelry. In Image B, however, the beads have been replaced with what appear to be small, colorful tiles set in a manner that mimics stained glass. These tiles feature vivid hues—red, green, blue, black—and are outlined with dark lines that resemble lead came used in stained glass windows. The texture and reflective quality also suggest a non-beaded, glass-like material. Despite this change in material, the overall structure and layering of the necklace and the arrangement of the bracelets remain consistent with the original design. Thus, the transformation involves replacing the beaded elements with a stained glass aesthetic while preserving the form and cultural symbolism.",

      "question": "Has the background been transformed into a stylized tapestry of warm earth tones, depicting varied African terrains through texture and color blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the background consists of a natural outdoor scene with a clear sky, distant hills, and dry grassland—typical of an African savanna landscape. In Image B, this natural setting has been replaced entirely with a highly textured, embroidered tapestry. The tapestry uses warm earth tones such as ochre, rust, tan, and deep reds, which evoke the colors of African deserts and savannas. It includes stylized representations of terrain features like rolling hills, rivers, and sparse vegetation (e.g., acacia trees), all rendered in raised threadwork that gives it a three-dimensional, tactile quality. The artistic style resembles traditional African textile art, where landscapes are abstracted and symbolically represented. This transformation turns the background into a symbolic, stylized depiction rather than a photorealistic one, aligning with the theme of cultural artistry. Therefore, the background has indeed been transformed into a tapestry-like representation of African terrain.",

      "question": "Has the hairstyle been transformed into a bas-relief sculpture style, with visible depth, shadow, and sculpted texture, while preserving its original color and structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hairstyle in Image A consists of tightly braided hair adorned with colorful beads, forming a traditional African tribal look. In Image B, the same hairstyle is present in terms of structure—numerous braids with beads—but the rendering has changed significantly. The hair now exhibits pronounced depth, shadowing, and surface texture that suggest a three-dimensional relief effect, similar to carved stone or bas-relief sculpture. The lighting highlights raised areas and creates shadows between the braids, enhancing the illusion of physical depth. However, the color scheme remains consistent with the original—dark brown hair with red, white, and yellow beads—indicating that the color and structural composition are preserved despite the stylistic shift. This transformation elevates the hairstyle from a realistic depiction to a sculptural one, maintaining cultural authenticity while introducing artistic abstraction. Thus, the hairstyle has been rendered in a bas-relief style while retaining its original color and structure.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain cultural authenticity and visual harmony across all transformed elements (attire, jewelry, background, hairstyle)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To assess cultural authenticity and visual harmony, we must consider whether the transformations respect and reflect African cultural aesthetics while creating a cohesive visual experience. The attire, jewelry, background, and hairstyle in Image B have all been stylized, but they do so using artistic techniques that resonate with African traditions—mosaic patterns, beadwork, textile art, and sculptural forms—all of which are found in various African cultures. The color palette remains rooted in earth tones and vibrant contrasts common in African art. The geometric patterns in the dress and the symbolic landscape in the background echo traditional African design principles. Although the materials have been artistically reimagined (e.g., stained glass, tapestry), the underlying motifs and cultural references remain intact. Furthermore, the transformations are consistent in style—each element is rendered with a sense of depth, texture, and craftsmanship that unifies the image. There is no jarring contrast between the elements; instead, they collectively form a harmonious, culturally resonant artwork. Therefore, despite the stylization, the image maintains both cultural authenticity and visual harmony.",
