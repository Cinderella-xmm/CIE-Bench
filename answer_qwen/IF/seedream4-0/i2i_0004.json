        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is a stylized figurine with exaggerated proportions typical of collectible bobblehead or chibi-style figures. The head is significantly larger in relation to the body compared to normal human proportions. This is a common stylistic choice in cartoonified or toy representations to emphasize facial features and create a more expressive appearance. In contrast, real human proportions (as seen in Image A) have a head that is approximately one-seventh to one-eighth of the total body height. Here, the head appears to be roughly half the size of the body, which is a clear exaggeration. Therefore, based on visual analysis and common knowledge of cartoon and toy design, the head has indeed been enlarged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized figure with smooth, simplified forms and solid, flat colors—characteristics typical of cartoon or toy designs. The clothing lacks detailed textures, shading, or folds; instead, it uses uniform black coloration with minimal detail. The limbs are short and rounded, and the overall silhouette is simplified, lacking anatomical precision. These traits align with the aesthetic of cartoonification, where realism is sacrificed for stylization and visual appeal. This contrasts with the realistic depiction in Image A, where clothing texture, depth, and natural body contours are present. Thus, the body in Image B is clearly cartoonified.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B shows white shelving units with rows of books—some dark blue with gold spines, others red with gold embossing—arranged neatly. This setup closely resembles a traditional bookshelf, often found in offices or libraries. The presence of multiple books, consistent spacing, and shelf structure supports this interpretation. While the background may be digitally added or staged for aesthetic purposes, its visual cues strongly indicate a bookshelf environment. Comparing with Image A, the same background is visible, confirming continuity and reinforcing the idea that the scene is set in front of a bookshelf. Therefore, the edited subject is indeed placed against a background resembling a bookshelf.",

      "question": "Are the facial features such as the eyes, smile, and proportions accurately maintained after enlarging the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the head in Image B is enlarged, the facial features have been stylized rather than accurately preserved. The eyes are large, round, and symmetrical, with prominent pupils and lack of fine details like eyelashes or wrinkles—common in cartoon characters. The smile is wide but simplified, lacking the nuanced expression seen in the original photo. The facial proportions are altered: the forehead is larger, the nose is reduced, and the cheeks are rosy and rounded, deviating from realistic anatomy. Although the general expression (happy) is retained, the accuracy of facial features is compromised for stylistic effect. Thus, despite the enlarged head, the facial features are not accurately maintained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face in Image B is highly stylized, with exaggerated features such as large eyes and a simplified mouth, but it does not resemble a realistic face—it is already cartoonified. However, there is a noticeable disconnect between the facial style and the rest of the body. The face is rendered with soft shading and subtle color gradients, while the body uses flat, glossy black surfaces with minimal detail. This creates a visual inconsistency: the face appears somewhat more detailed and expressive than the body, which is blocky and minimalistic. Despite both being stylized, the transition between the two parts feels abrupt, suggesting they were designed separately. Therefore, the cartoonified body does not blend seamlessly with the face and appears somewhat intrusive due to this mismatch in rendering style.",
