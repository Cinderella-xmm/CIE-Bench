      "question": "Is the character depicted as a small, stylized chibi figure suitable for a keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is rendered in a chibi art style, which is characterized by exaggerated proportions such as a large head and small body, commonly used in collectible figures and accessories. The figure is compact, with simplified features and a design that emphasizes cuteness and appeal, typical of merchandise like keychains. Its size and form factor are consistent with a keychain accessory, especially given the presence of a chain attached at the top. This aligns with common product design practices where chibi-style figures are produced as wearable or portable items.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the armor feature glossy enamel-like colors with visible reflections and thick black outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the armor on the character displays a shiny, reflective surface, particularly noticeable on the metallic parts such as the chest plate, shoulder guards, and gauntlets. These areas exhibit highlights and specular reflections, suggesting a glossy finish akin to enamel paint. Additionally, the edges of the armor pieces are defined by bold, thick black outlines, which are characteristic of stylized illustrations and enamel pins. This combination of reflective surfaces and strong outlines enhances the visual depth and cartoonish aesthetic typical of collectible keychains.",

      "question": "Is the character's head significantly larger than the body, while still showing detailed curly hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's head is proportionally much larger compared to its body, a hallmark of the chibi art style. Despite this exaggeration, the hair is intricately designed with curls and volume, maintaining a high level of detail. The texture and flow of the hair are clearly visible, indicating careful rendering even within the stylized format. This balance between exaggerated proportions and detailed features is typical of chibi designs meant to be both cute and visually engaging.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is a small silver chain visibly attached to the character, suggesting it is a keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the character in Image B, a silver-colored metal chain is clearly visible, connected through a small loop at the crown of the head. This chain extends upward and out of the frame, which is consistent with how keychains are typically constructed. The presence of this chain, along with the characterâ€™s compact and stylized form, strongly indicates that the object is intended to be a keychain. Such attachments are standard in collectible pin-based keychains.",

      "question": "Is the background a plain, dark, velvet-textured surface without any architectural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is uniformly dark and exhibits a soft, textured appearance consistent with velvet fabric. There are no architectural details, such as arches or columns, present. The texture is smooth with subtle variations in shading, typical of a studio backdrop used to highlight collectible items. This choice of background helps emphasize the character without distraction, which is common in product photography for merchandise like keychains.",
