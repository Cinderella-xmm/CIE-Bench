      "question": "Is the character's head significantly larger than the body, consistent with chibi-style proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character exhibits a large, rounded head in proportion to a small, simplified torso. This is a hallmark of chibi or 'super-deformed' art style, where the head is exaggeratedly large relative to the body to emphasize cuteness and expressiveness. The body is minimalistic, lacking detailed limbs or posture, further reinforcing the chibi aesthetic. This visual cue aligns with common conventions in anime and cartoon design where oversized heads are used for comedic or endearing effect. The lack of visible limbs and the compact torso suggest intentional stylization toward a toy-like or figurine appearance, typical of chibi representations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) visibly exaggerated and prominent in size compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are highly stylized: the eyes are large, round, and centrally placed with prominent black pupils and white highlights, which is characteristic of cartoon or chibi designs. The mouth is wide open in a cheerful smile, with an exaggerated red interior and visible teeth, enhancing expressiveness. The nose is absent or minimized, a common simplification in such styles. In contrast, Image A shows natural human proportions with subtle, realistic facial features—smaller eyes, a defined nose, and a neutral mouth. The exaggeration in Image B clearly departs from realism and emphasizes charm through hyperbole, which is consistent with chibi aesthetics.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the character wear a striped shirt with a vibrant color scheme that matches the original red and white stripes on a dark background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character wears a dark blue shirt with vertical stripes in red and white, matching the pattern seen in Image A. The stripes are evenly spaced and run vertically down the shirt, consistent with the original clothing. The colors appear vibrant and distinct against the dark base, suggesting a deliberate effort to preserve the identity of the original attire while adapting it to a cartoonish style. Although the material texture is glossy and stylized, the color scheme and stripe pattern remain faithful to the original image, indicating continuity in design elements despite the transformation into a chibi form.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the character appear to have a smooth, glossy surface resembling polished enamel, with a defined outline suggesting a magnet shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a character with a highly reflective, shiny surface that mimics polished enamel or plastic, evident from light reflections and highlights across the face and clothing. The edges are sharply defined with a black border, giving it a flat, cut-out appearance reminiscent of a fridge magnet or collectible pin. The overall silhouette is clean and uniform, with no depth or shadowing beyond the subtle drop shadow beneath the figure, reinforcing the impression of a two-dimensional object designed for display. This aesthetic choice suggests a product-like quality, commonly seen in merchandise or digital avatars styled as physical items.",

      "question": "Is the background a bright, pastel-colored solid or gradient, enhancing the playful aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of two soft, pastel colors—light blue and pink—divided diagonally. These colors are bright yet gentle, contributing to a cheerful and whimsical atmosphere. Pastel gradients are often used in children’s media, cartoons, and kawaii-style designs to evoke playfulness and positivity. The absence of complex textures or patterns ensures that attention remains on the character, while the color contrast adds visual interest without overwhelming the scene. This choice aligns with modern design trends in digital illustrations aimed at evoking joy and lightheartedness.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the character display a playful or exaggerated facial expression (e.g., wide eyes, smile, raised eyebrows) that enhances charm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B has a wide, open-mouthed smile showing teeth, large expressive eyes with bright highlights, and slightly raised eyebrows, all of which contribute to a joyful and animated expression. These features are exaggerated beyond normal human proportions and are typical of characters designed to be cute or appealing. Compared to the neutral, serious expression in Image A, this version conveys emotion and personality through stylization. Such expressions are deliberately crafted in chibi art to enhance charm and relatability, especially in contexts like toys, avatars, or branding.",
