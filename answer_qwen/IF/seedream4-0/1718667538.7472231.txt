    "Question": "Q1: Is the tiger figure rendered in a flat, cut-paper style with defined edges and no realistic shading?",
    "explanation": "The tiger figure in Image B exhibits sharp, clean edges and lacks subtle gradients or soft shadows that would suggest realistic 3D rendering. Instead, the form is composed of distinct, layered planes resembling paper cutouts, particularly noticeable in the facial features, ears, and fur texture. The lighting appears uniform across surfaces, with no depth-based shading, reinforcing the impression of a flat, constructed object. This visual style aligns with papercraft art, where objects are built from layered paper with defined silhouettes. The absence of naturalistic skin texture or volumetric lighting further supports the conclusion that it is not realistically shaded but rather stylized to mimic paper art.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the tiger's stripes visibly wider and more stylized than natural tiger markings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger’s stripes are bold, geometric, and highly symmetrical, with exaggerated width and simplified patterns compared to the irregular, narrower, and more organic stripe patterns seen in real tigers. Natural tiger stripes vary in thickness and follow the contours of the body subtly, whereas here they appear deliberately designed for aesthetic impact, with consistent spacing and angular shapes. This stylization is common in artistic representations such as masks or origami, where realism is sacrificed for visual appeal. Thus, the stripes are clearly more stylized and wider than natural ones.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the tiger's whiskers noticeably longer and thicker than natural proportions?",
    "explanation": "The whiskers in Image B are significantly elongated and thickened compared to natural tiger whiskers, which are typically fine, flexible, and proportionate to the face. Here, the whiskers are depicted as rigid, prominent white lines extending outward dramatically, emphasizing their presence as part of the decorative design. This exaggeration is consistent with artistic stylization in paper crafts or theatrical masks, where features are amplified for visual effect. Therefore, they deviate from natural proportions in both length and thickness.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the kimono appear as if composed of multiple overlapping paper layers with distinct edges?",
    "explanation": "The kimono in Image B shows clear signs of being constructed from layered paper elements. Each floral motif and fabric fold has sharp, well-defined borders, and the overlapping sections—such as the sash (obi) and collar—have visible layering that mimics how paper would be stacked. The material appears matte and slightly rigid, like folded cardstock, and the transitions between colors and patterns have crisp edges without blending. This suggests a physical construction akin to papercraft, where each component is separate and layered, giving the garment a three-dimensional yet flat appearance typical of paper art.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there shiny, metallic gold accents on the cherry blossom patterns of the kimono?",
    "explanation": "Yes, the cherry blossoms on the kimono in Image B feature golden highlights that reflect light with a metallic sheen, distinguishing them from the matte pink and black elements of the rest of the design. These gold flowers are textured with fine details resembling embossing or foil application, commonly used in traditional Japanese paper crafts or decorative arts. The contrast between the reflective gold and the non-reflective base material confirms the presence of metallic accents, enhancing the ornamental quality of the garment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there visible perforations, tabs, or fold lines indicating detachable sections of the image?",
    "explanation": "While the image does not show actual perforations or tabs, there are clear fold lines and crease marks along the edges of the kimono and the surrounding paper structures, especially on the foreground display piece. These folds suggest that the entire composition may be part of an interactive paper model, such as a pop-up book or diorama. The segmented panels at the bottom, which resemble an accordion-style paper structure, include visible hinges and fold lines that imply modularity. Although no perforations are evident, the structural design strongly indicates detachable or foldable components.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there visible fold lines or structural elements suggesting the image can be physically folded or interacted with?",
    "explanation": "The presence of a multi-panel paper structure in the foreground—resembling a fanfold or accordion book—with clearly defined creases and layered segments strongly suggests that this image represents a physical object designed to be folded or manipulated. Additionally, the kimono itself has sharp creases and layered elements that mimic folded paper, and the overall composition resembles a papercraft diorama. These structural cues indicate interactivity, such as unfolding or assembling parts, which is characteristic of kinetic paper art. Therefore, fold lines and structural elements are present and imply physical interaction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
