      "question": "Is the sandcastle rendered as a translucent crystal sculpture with visible facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure resembling a sandcastle is composed of numerous transparent, geometrically shaped elements that resemble cut crystals. These elements have sharp edges and flat surfaces, characteristic of faceted gemstones or crystal prisms. The translucency is evident from the way light passes through them, creating reflections and refractions typical of crystal materials. This contrasts sharply with a real sandcastle made of compacted sand, which would be opaque and non-reflective. Based on these visual cues—translucency, angular facets, and reflective properties—the structure is clearly not sand but a crystal-like sculpture.",

      "question": "Are there soft blue highlights visible on the surface of the crystal castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the crystal castle in Image B, several of the facets reflect a subtle blue hue. These highlights appear to be caused by internal reflections within the crystal material, possibly due to tinting or lighting conditions in the gallery setting. Blue tones are particularly noticeable on the upper spires and certain angled faces of the crystal blocks. In contrast, natural sandcastles do not exhibit such coloration unless artificially colored. The presence of these soft blue accents supports the interpretation that the sculpture is crafted from a crystalline material with inherent or induced color variation.",

      "question": "Have all seashells been replaced with small, polished gemstones in pastel hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While many of the objects scattered around the base of the crystal castle resemble seashells in shape, they are clearly made of a translucent, iridescent material consistent with polished gemstones or glass. Their surfaces show smooth, reflective qualities and pastel colors such as pink, lavender, and pale blue. However, upon closer observation, some objects retain shell-like textures and natural forms (e.g., spiral conch shapes), suggesting that not all seashells have been completely replaced. Instead, there appears to be a mix of actual seashells and gemstone replicas. Therefore, the statement that 'all' seashells have been replaced is inaccurate because at least some retain organic characteristics.",

      "question": "Is the ocean depicted as a wave pattern etched into a frosted glass slab rather than flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, behind the crystal castle, there is a large vertical panel made of frosted glass. On this panel, a stylized wave pattern is visibly etched, featuring curved lines and textured details that mimic the motion of waves. There is no indication of liquid water or movement; instead, the scene is static and enclosed. This artistic representation replaces the dynamic ocean seen in typical beach scenes with a fixed, decorative element. The use of frosted glass and etching techniques is common in museum displays to simulate natural phenomena without using actual water. Thus, the ocean is indeed represented as an etched design on glass.",

      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a minimalist gallery display case with clean edges and neutral surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The environment surrounding the crystal sculpture in Image B features clear glass walls, a white base platform, and a plain background wall typical of a museum or art gallery setting. The display case has sharp, clean edges and is free of decorative elements, emphasizing minimalism. Overhead lighting suggests a controlled indoor environment, and the absence of outdoor elements like sky or sand confirms it's an indoor installation. Additionally, other artworks are faintly visible in the background, reinforcing the context of an exhibition space. All these cues point to the scene being presented within a curated, minimalist gallery display case.",
