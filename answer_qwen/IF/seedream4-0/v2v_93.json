      "question": "Is the thermometer depicted in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The thermometer in Image B features exaggerated lighting, smooth gradients, and stylized elements such as the transparent glass tube with a red liquid column and metallic highlights that are not typical of real-world thermometers. The overall design includes rounded edges, soft shadows, and a glossy finish, which are characteristic of 3D-rendered cartoon or illustrative styles rather than photorealistic depictions. Additionally, the presence of a decorative banner and the stylized text further supports the interpretation that this is a stylized, cartoon-like representation rather than a realistic one. These visual cues align with common design practices in digital illustrations meant to be visually appealing and thematic, especially in contexts like educational or promotional materials.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image use soft lighting to highlight the thermometer's metallic finish and clearly visible dial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to be carefully controlled to enhance the three-dimensional appearance of the thermometer. Soft highlights are visible on the metallic bezel and the central pivot, suggesting a diffused light source that avoids harsh reflections. This soft lighting emphasizes the curvature and reflective properties of the metal, contributing to the perception of depth and realism within the stylized context. The dial remains clearly legible due to even illumination without glare or shadow obstruction. This technique is commonly used in digital illustrations to balance aesthetic appeal with functional clarity, ensuring that critical information (like temperature readings) remains readable while enhancing visual texture.",

      "question": "Are the stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] clearly incorporated into the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of Image B, there is a beige nameplate with black text that explicitly states 'Temperature Range +200]' and '[Accuracy +10°C]'. The text is large enough to be easily read and positioned prominently within the frame. The formatting uses brackets and clear typography, ensuring that these technical specifications are both visible and legible. This inclusion serves to provide key performance metrics about the device, reinforcing its precision-oriented branding. Given the clarity and placement, it is evident that these statistics are intentionally highlighted for the viewer.",

      "question": "Is there a title banner at the top labeled \"Precision Thermal Gauge\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a ribbon-style banner located at the top center of the frame. The banner has a light peach color with a subtle gradient and shadowing, giving it a raised, three-dimensional appearance. It contains the text 'Precision Thermal Gauge' in a bold, sans-serif font. This element is stylistically consistent with labels used in illustrated product displays or infographics to convey the name or function of the object. The placement and design suggest it is intended to serve as a title, identifying the device’s purpose.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of Image B, there is a rectangular nameplate with rounded corners and a light beige background. It contains the text 'Temperature Range +200]' and '[Accuracy +10°C]', which are technical specifications rather than a formal designation like a model number or brand name. While this plate provides important information about the gauge's capabilities, it does not identify the item by a specific designation such as 'Model X-700' or 'ThermoPro'. Therefore, although it functions as an informational label, it does not serve as a formal identification tag for the item itself.",

      "question": "Does the image have crisp borders surrounding the card?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is framed by a thick, squared border with rounded corners, featuring a blue-gray gradient and subtle metallic accents. The border has defined edges and sharp transitions between colors and textures, indicating high-quality rendering. There are also small circular rivets at each corner, adding to the structured, mechanical appearance. These elements collectively create a clean, well-defined perimeter around the central thermometer graphic, resembling a card or panel. The crispness of the lines and uniformity of the border suggest intentional design choices aimed at providing a polished, professional look.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B consists of a gradient of cool blue tones, transitioning from darker shades at the edges to lighter hues near the center. This color scheme is commonly associated with technology, science, and engineering fields, where cool colors evoke a sense of calmness, reliability, and precision. The absence of distracting patterns or warm colors reinforces a professional and clinical atmosphere. Combined with the clean layout, metallic finishes, and precise labeling, the background contributes effectively to a theme of scientific accuracy and technical sophistication.",
