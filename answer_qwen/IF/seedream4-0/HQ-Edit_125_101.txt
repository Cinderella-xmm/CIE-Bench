    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The image clearly shows a transparent spherical boundary enclosing the entire scene, which is characteristic of a snow globe. The dome is smooth and rounded, with reflections and refractions visible on its surface, consistent with glass or acrylic material used in such decorative items. Inside the sphere, there are miniature figures and structures, including the Eiffel Tower and a ballerina, all contained within the enclosed space. This visual evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the scene is indeed enclosed within a transparent spherical boundary resembling a snow globe.",

    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "Inside the snow globe, there is a detailed 3D figure of a ballerina captured mid-leap, striking a pose similar to that of a dancer performing an arabesque. The figure is positioned dynamically, with one leg extended high and arms gracefully raised, mirroring the form of a classical ballet dancer. The posture matches the leaping motion seen in the original image (Image A), suggesting it is a replication of that pose. Given the craftsmanship and scale, this is clearly a sculpted representation designed to emulate the original dancer's movement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "Within the snow globe, the Eiffel Tower is prominently featured as the central landmark. In addition, several other recognizable Parisian buildings are visible in the background, including what appears to be Notre-Dame Cathedral (with its distinctive twin towers and rose window) and possibly the Palais Garnier or another historic structure with domes and spires. These architectural elements are stylized but identifiable as iconic Parisian landmarks. Their inclusion alongside the Eiffel Tower confirms that at least two other recognizable Parisian landmarks are present inside the globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The interior of the snow globe contains numerous white snowflake designs etched or printed onto the inner surface of the glass. Additionally, swirling patterns of light and mist-like effects surround the Eiffel Tower and other structures, giving the impression of falling snow or frosty air currents. These swirling elements, combined with the static snowflakes, create a dynamic winter atmosphere typical of snow globes. Although the snowflakes themselves are not animated, their presence and arrangement suggest a snowy environment surrounding the landmarks.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The base of the snow globe is made of a metallic material with a bronze-like finish, featuring ornate detailing along the edges and engraved text in cursive French script. The visible engraving includes phrases such as 'Ballet France' and possibly 'Paris', indicating a thematic connection to French culture and ballet. The base appears solid and crafted from metal, not glass, and supports the transparent globe above it. While the top portion is glass, the base itself is clearly metallic and inscribed, matching the description of a bronze and glass construction with French engravings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
