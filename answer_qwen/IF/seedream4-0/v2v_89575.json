      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is depicted in a pool with her upper body visible above the water. Behind her is a large, detailed stone relief featuring a central female figure that closely resembles her in posture and appearance. However, the woman herself is not made of stone; she is clearly a living person with natural skin tone and hair. The stone carving behind her is separate and serves as a backdrop. Therefore, the woman has not been transformed into a stone carving—she remains human, positioned in front of an artistic representation. This conclusion is based on visual cues such as skin texture, color contrast, and the distinct separation between the real person and the carved figure.",

      "question": "Are there stylized adornments present on the stone carving?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stone carving in Image B features a central female figure adorned with intricate details. She wears a headdress with radiating elements resembling a sunburst or crown, large earrings, and a necklace with a pendant. These are clearly stylized adornments typical of ancient or mythological art forms, possibly inspired by Mesoamerican or Southeast Asian traditions. The surrounding carvings include symbolic flora and mythical creatures, reinforcing the ceremonial and ornate nature of the design. Thus, the presence of these decorative elements confirms that stylized adornments are indeed present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the pool in Image B shows ripples and reflections, but more notably, the bottom of the pool is intricately carved with swirling, spiral-like patterns that resemble flowing water or abstract waves. These designs are etched into the stone beneath the water, creating a visual effect of movement even when the water is still. This suggests that the pool itself is designed to mimic fluid motion through its architectural detailing. Therefore, the water’s appearance is enhanced by these deliberate, intricate patterns in the pool floor.",

      "question": "Has the jungle been reimagined as a relief with sacred plants and mythical guardians?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists entirely of a stone relief depicting a scene rich with symbolic imagery. The central figure is flanked by two lion-like mythical guardians, which are common motifs in ancient temple art. Between them are stylized representations of plants, including leafy fronds and tall stems, suggesting sacred flora. While the original jungle (from Image A) is lush and natural, this image replaces it with a highly stylized, sculpted version. The transformation from a living ecosystem to a carved narrative scene indicates that the jungle has been reimagined as a symbolic, artistic relief featuring sacred elements and protective deities. This aligns with cultural depictions found in temples and religious architecture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a stone wall and pool with visible signs of aging: rough textures, uneven surfaces, discoloration, and subtle erosion patterns consistent with weathered stone. The color scheme is dominated by warm, muted tones—beiges, tans, and browns—typical of aged limestone or sandstone used in ancient monuments. These characteristics evoke the appearance of historical or archaeological sites, such as those found in Mayan or Hindu temples. The overall aesthetic conveys a sense of antiquity and permanence, matching the description of timeworn, monumental stonework.",
