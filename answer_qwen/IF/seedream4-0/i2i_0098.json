        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area above the sink where a mirror would typically be located now features a rectangular piece of wall art with a minimalist landscape design. The visual cues indicate that the reflective surface characteristic of a mirror is absent. Instead, the artwork has a textured appearance consistent with fabric canvas, and it displays a grayscale mountain scene. Based on common bathroom design practices, mirrors are often placed above sinks for functionality, but in this case, the space has been repurposed for decorative art. Therefore, the mirror is no longer present.",

      "question": "Has the area previously occupied by the mirror been replaced with a minimalist landscape wall art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the space directly above the sink, which in typical bathroom layouts would house a mirror, now contains a rectangular artwork depicting a minimalist landscape with soft, muted tones and abstract mountain forms. This artwork is centered and proportionally aligned with the sink below, suggesting intentional placement. Comparing with Image A (where a mirror is clearly visible), the replacement is evident: the reflective surface is gone, and a new decorative element occupies the same spatial location. The style of the artwork—simple, monochromatic, and nature-inspired—aligns with minimalist aesthetic principles. Thus, the mirror has indeed been replaced by this wall art.",

      "question": "Does the minimalist landscape wall art appear to have a fabric canvas material texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the artwork in Image B exhibits a subtle, slightly uneven texture that is not smooth or glossy like a printed poster or framed photo. Instead, it shows fine horizontal and vertical fibers consistent with woven fabric, such as linen or cotton canvas. Additionally, the way light interacts with the surface—diffuse rather than specular reflection—suggests a matte, textile-like finish. In contrast, a standard mirror or glass-framed print would reflect more sharply. Given these visual cues and knowledge about common materials used in minimalist decor, the artwork appears to be made from fabric canvas, a popular choice for contemporary wall art due to its tactile quality and natural aesthetic.",

      "question": "Have any other parts of the bathroom, such as the sink, vase, lights, or tiles, been altered unintentionally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the sink remains unchanged—a white, round vessel basin mounted on a wooden floating vanity. The dark amber-colored vase with red flowers is still present in the same position to the left of the sink. The lighting fixtures on either side of the artwork are identical in form and illumination to those in Image A, maintaining symmetry and ambient warmth. The marble-look tiles on the wall retain their original pattern, color, and grout lines. There are no visible distortions, misalignments, or changes in these elements. The edits were focused solely on replacing the mirror with artwork, and all surrounding components remain consistent with the original setup. Therefore, no unintended alterations have occurred.",

      "question": "Are there any additional elements or changes in the image beyond removing the mirror and replacing it with a minimalist landscape wall art on a fabric canvas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The primary change between Image A and Image B is the replacement of the mirror with a minimalist landscape wall art on what appears to be a fabric canvas. All other elements—the sink, vanity, vase, flowers, lighting, and wall tiles—remain visually identical in position, appearance, and condition. There are no added objects, removed accessories, or modifications to the layout or lighting scheme. The transition is clean and focused, suggesting a deliberate design choice without introducing any extraneous changes. Therefore, no additional alterations beyond the mirror-to-artwork swap are present.",
