    "Question": "Q1: Does the image have a white border surrounding it?",
    "explanation": "Upon visual inspection of Image B, there is a distinct white margin around the entire photograph, framing the central image. This white border is consistent in width on all sides and appears to be digitally added, as it contrasts with the darker tones of the image content. The presence of this border suggests a stylistic choice, possibly mimicking a printed photo or Polaroid format. Based on this observation, the answer is clearly affirmative.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the caption “11:13 AM” visible at the bottom within the white border?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, at the bottom right corner of the white border, faint text reading '11:13 AM' is visible. This timestamp is rendered in a light, almost translucent font that blends into the white background but is still legible upon close inspection. It is positioned consistently with how timestamps appear on instant camera prints (e.g., Polaroid), reinforcing the idea of a simulated physical print. Therefore, the caption is present and readable.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Has the faded effect been applied to the entire image?",
    "explanation": "The image exhibits a subtle fading effect across its entirety, particularly noticeable in the color saturation and contrast levels. The colors are slightly desaturated compared to what would be expected in a high-contrast digital photograph, and there's a softness in the edges and lighting that suggests intentional tonal reduction. This effect is uniformly distributed across the sky, buildings, trees, and the subject, indicating that the fade was applied globally rather than selectively. This gives the image a vintage or analog film aesthetic, consistent with a faded look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the image have a paper-like grain texture applied to it?",
    "explanation": "Upon close examination of Image B, a fine, speckled texture resembling paper grain is visible throughout the image. This texture is especially apparent in uniform areas such as the sky and the dark surface of the ramp, where the grain adds a tactile quality similar to photographic paper. This texture is not present in the original digital image (Image A), which appears smoother. The addition of this grain enhances the analog feel, suggesting a simulation of a physical print. Thus, the paper-like grain texture has indeed been applied.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the original composition and elements of the image preserved, aside from the added white border, caption, faded effect, and grain texture?",
    "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the core composition remains identical: the skateboarder is in mid-air performing a trick, the skateboard is below him, the background includes bare trees, buildings, and a clear blue sky, and the curved black structure is visible. The positioning of the subject, lighting, and spatial relationships are unchanged. The only differences are the additions of the white border, timestamp, faded tone, and grain texture—none of which alter the fundamental elements or layout. Therefore, the original composition and content are fully preserved despite the stylistic modifications.",
    "answer": "Yes"
