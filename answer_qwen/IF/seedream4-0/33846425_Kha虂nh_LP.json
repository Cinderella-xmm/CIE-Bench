      "question": "Has the woman's skirt been visibly enlarged in size compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's skirt appears fuller and more voluminous than in Image A. The hemline of the skirt extends further outward, creating a wider silhouette. This change is likely due to digital editing where the skirt's fabric has been expanded or enhanced to give it a more dramatic, flowing appearance. Comparing both images, the difference in volume is noticeable, especially around the lower portion of the skirt. In Image A, the skirt seems to follow a more natural drape, while in Image B, the added fullness suggests intentional enlargement. This conclusion is based on visual comparison of the skirt’s width and shape across both images.",

      "question": "Are the lace details on the woman's dress more intricate and clearly visible than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lace patterns on the woman's dress appear sharper and more defined compared to Image A. The lighting and contrast have been adjusted to enhance the texture of the lace, making the floral and geometric patterns stand out more prominently. Additionally, the digital enhancement may have increased the clarity of fine details such as the edges of the lace cutouts and the stitching. In Image A, the lace is visible but less pronounced due to softer lighting and slightly lower contrast. Therefore, the visual cues in Image B suggest that the lace details have been digitally sharpened or enhanced for greater visibility.",

      "question": "Has the yellow car been transformed into a vintage camper van with features such as side windows, a raised roof, or other camper-specific modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vehicle retains its basic structure as a yellow off-road-style car, but there are notable changes: the roofline now appears higher and more elongated, resembling a camper van. Additionally, a painted floral design is visible along the upper side of the vehicle, which is typical of vintage campers. While side windows are not clearly visible, the overall shape and decorative elements suggest a transformation into a camper van style. In Image A, the car is clearly a standard open-top or classic SUV without any camper modifications. The difference in roof height and the addition of decorative paint indicate a deliberate digital alteration to mimic a vintage camper van aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are there visible floral paintings on the body of the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side of the yellow vehicle displays a colorful floral painting featuring pink, red, and blue flowers with green leaves. This artwork is positioned along the upper edge of the vehicle’s body, just below the roofline. Such painted designs are common on vintage campers and are used to enhance their retro charm. In Image A, the same area of the vehicle is plain yellow with no visible artwork, confirming that the floral painting is an added element in Image B. This detail supports the idea that the vehicle has been digitally modified to resemble a stylized vintage camper.",

      "question": "Is the entire scene placed on a background that resembles textured kraft paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image is framed by a border that mimics torn kraft paper, giving the impression that the photograph is viewed through a hole in a brown paper sheet. The texture is rough and uneven, consistent with real kraft paper, and it surrounds the central image on all sides. This effect is not present in Image A, where the background is a continuous sky and sea view without any overlay. The kraft paper frame is a clear digital addition intended to create a nostalgic or scrapbook-like aesthetic, suggesting that the entire scene is presented as if displayed on or within a piece of paper.",

      "question": "Does the image have decorative borders featuring nautical elements such as waves, anchors, or ropes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kraft paper border includes small decorative elements such as anchors, lifebuoys, and rope patterns along the top and bottom edges. These motifs are characteristic of nautical themes and are commonly used in beach or seaside-themed designs. The presence of these symbols reinforces the coastal setting of the scene. In Image A, there are no such decorative elements; the image is unframed and lacks any thematic embellishments. Thus, the addition of nautical icons in Image B is a deliberate artistic choice to enhance the maritime atmosphere.",
