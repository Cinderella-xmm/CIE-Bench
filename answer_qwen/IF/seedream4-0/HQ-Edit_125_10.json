      "question": "Is the Viking ship displayed as artwork on the front cover of a rectangular board game box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object is a rectangular box with a prominent illustration of a Viking longship on its front cover. The ship is depicted in a detailed and stylized manner, consistent with artistic representations commonly used on board game packaging. The box is placed upright on a game board, which further supports the context of it being a board game. The design and presentation are typical of commercial board games that use thematic artwork to convey the game's setting. The ship is clearly not a physical model but rather an image printed on the box, indicating it is artwork. Therefore, based on visual cues and common conventions in board game design, the Viking ship is indeed displayed as artwork on the front cover.",

      "question": "Are Norse motifs such as runic patterns, interlacing designs, or dragon heads visibly integrated into the artwork of the ship on the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artwork on the box features several elements characteristic of Norse design. The ship's prow is shaped like a dragon head, a common motif in Viking art and mythology. Additionally, the sail displays a circular knotwork pattern, which is a hallmark of Norse interlacing designs. These patterns are often associated with Norse symbolism and craftsmanship. The side of the box also shows a similar knotwork emblem, reinforcing the Norse theme. Given these visual details, it is clear that Norse motifs are intentionally incorporated into the artwork.",

      "question": "Is the title \"Voyage of the Vikings\" displayed in bold, readable typography on the box cover?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the front cover of the box, the text 'Voyage of the Vikings' is prominently displayed across the sail of the ship. The font is large, bold, and easily legible, with a style that complements the Viking theme—using a slightly rustic, hand-drawn appearance. The placement and contrast against the background ensure readability. This matches typical board game design practices where the title is made visually dominant to attract attention and convey the theme. Thus, the title is clearly visible and well-integrated into the artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the circular knotwork pattern from the sail used as part of a game board layout, such as a grid or path system, within the box artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular knotwork pattern appears on the sail of the ship in the artwork on the box, but there is no indication that this pattern is replicated or adapted into the game board layout shown in the foreground. The game board features a grid-like structure with various symbols and numbers, but none of them resemble the knotwork design. While the pattern is present on the box, it is not used as a functional element of the game board’s design. Therefore, the knotwork pattern is purely decorative on the box and not integrated into the gameplay layout.",

      "question": "Are there small, stylized figures resembling the rowers placed along the ship's side or on the game board area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the game board in the foreground of Image B, there are several small figurines depicting Viking rowers, each holding oars. These figures are positioned on the board, suggesting they are game pieces representing players or units. They are stylized and consistent with the Viking theme, matching the aesthetic of the ship on the box. Although the ship on the box itself does not have rowers depicted (as it is an artistic rendering), the presence of these figures on the actual game board indicates their inclusion in the game mechanics. Therefore, such figures are present on the game board area.",

      "question": "Do the side panels of the game box feature a visible wooden texture or grain pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The side panel of the game box visible in Image B shows a distinct wood grain pattern, mimicking the appearance of real wood. This texture is consistent across the panel and is likely intended to enhance the thematic authenticity of the Viking design, aligning with the use of wood in historical Viking ships and craftsmanship. The texture is not just a flat color but includes variations in tone and lines that resemble natural wood grain. This detail suggests a deliberate design choice to evoke a tactile and historical feel, reinforcing the game’s theme.",
