      "question": "Does the dancing woman appear as if made of stained glass with distinct panel-like divisions and dark outlines resembling lead came?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s form is composed of segmented areas separated by dark, linear borders that mimic the lead came used in traditional stained glass windows. These lines define her limbs, torso, and facial features, dividing the image into geometric and organic panels filled with colored sections. The visual texture resembles actual stained glass, where each color segment is bounded by a dark outline, creating a mosaic-like effect. This technique is characteristic of stained glass art, particularly in the style of artists like Tiffany or Morris. The use of such outlines, combined with the translucent appearance of the colors, strongly suggests a stained-glass aesthetic. Therefore, based on the visual cues—distinct paneling and dark leading—the representation aligns with stained glass.",

      "question": "Is the woman’s pose identical to the original, with one leg lifted and arms positioned dynamically as in the source image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pose of the woman in Image B is nearly identical to that in Image A. In both images, she is captured mid-dance with her right leg lifted high and bent at the knee, while her left leg supports her weight. Her arms are extended in a graceful arc—one raised above her head, holding a cloth, and the other reaching outward. The dynamic balance and angularity of her posture are preserved. Although the medium has changed (from realistic painting to stained glass), the anatomical positioning and movement remain consistent. This indicates that the artist maintained the original pose during the transformation, ensuring continuity in the figure’s expression and motion. Thus, despite stylistic changes, the pose is faithfully reproduced.",

      "question": "Are the woman’s garments and body adorned with flowing, curvilinear lines and intricate geometric patterns consistent with Art Nouveau design principles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Art Nouveau is characterized by sinuous, organic lines, floral motifs, and decorative symmetry. While the woman’s clothing in Image B features bold geometric patterns—especially in the dress and accessories—these are not primarily curvilinear but rather angular and rectilinear, reflecting African textile traditions. However, the overall composition uses flowing lines in the background and frame, such as the arched stained-glass border and stylized trees, which do incorporate Art Nouveau elements. But the garments themselves, though colorful and patterned, rely more on blocky, angular designs typical of African kente or mud-cloth patterns than on the fluid, swirling forms central to Art Nouveau. Thus, while some elements echo Art Nouveau aesthetics, the garments themselves are not predominantly defined by flowing, curvilinear lines.",

      "question": "Are the trees and huts in the background redesigned with smooth, curving lines and organic shapes typical of Art Nouveau, rather than naturalistic forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements—including the acacia trees and thatched huts—are rendered with simplified, stylized forms. The tree branches and foliage are depicted with smooth, undulating lines and rounded shapes, lacking the sharp realism seen in Image A. Similarly, the huts have softened edges and curved rooflines, contributing to an overall sense of elegance and rhythm. These features align with Art Nouveau's preference for organic, flowing forms over rigid naturalism. The integration of these elements within the stained-glass framework further enhances their decorative, non-literal quality. Thus, the background has been reimagined using Art Nouveau principles, emphasizing harmony and ornamental beauty over accuracy.",

      "question": "Is the overall color scheme of the image muted and iridescent, resembling colored glass with soft transitions and low contrast, rather than vibrant, saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a palette that mimics the look of stained glass, with colors that appear slightly subdued and layered, as if light is passing through translucent panes. While the hues remain rich—especially yellows, reds, and blues—they are softened by the glass-like texture and the presence of shadowed outlines. The transitions between colors are gentle, often blending at the edges of panels, which creates a luminous, iridescent effect. This contrasts with Image A, where the colors are brighter and more saturated, typical of a painted scene. In Image B, the lighting appears diffused, enhancing the stained-glass illusion. Therefore, the color scheme leans toward muted, glowing tones rather than high saturation, consistent with how colored glass behaves under light.",

      "question": "Does the entire image exhibit a sense of continuous, flowing ornamentation and balanced movement, with decorative details linking the dancer and environment in a unified design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of Image B demonstrates a strong sense of unity and flow. The stained-glass style integrates the dancer seamlessly with her surroundings through shared decorative motifs—such as the curving lines in the border, the stylized trees, and the rhythmic patterns in her clothing and the ground. The arched frame encloses the scene, guiding the viewer’s eye around the dancer in a circular motion. The background figures and animals are also stylized and arranged harmoniously, contributing to the overall balance. Moreover, the use of repeating patterns and color gradients across the entire image creates a cohesive visual narrative. This interconnectedness, where every element contributes to a larger decorative whole, reflects the Art Nouveau ideal of total art (Gesamtkunstwerk). Hence, the image achieves a unified, flowing design.",
