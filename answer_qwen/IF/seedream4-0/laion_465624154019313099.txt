    "Question": "Q1: Is the edited image a two-panel comic strip with the title “Cake Conundrum!” displayed at the top?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the layout clearly shows a structured comic format. At the very top, in bold red letters with a black outline, the title 'Cake Conundrum' is prominently displayed. Below this title are two distinct panels: the first panel features a cartoonified cake character with expressive eyes and a speech bubble, and the second panel splits into two parts — one showing the same cake character now angry, and another depicting a superhero-like figure with a shield adorned with strawberries. This arrangement confirms that it is indeed a two-panel comic strip (with the second panel further subdivided), and the title is correctly positioned at the top. The visual cues align perfectly with the description of a comic strip format.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the cake have expressive eyes added to its surface, positioned where the face would be, and is there a strawberry placed on top resembling a hat?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cake in the first panel has been anthropomorphized. Two large, cartoonish eyes are digitally added to the front of the cake, giving it a facial expression. These eyes are positioned symmetrically near the top center of the cake's surface, which corresponds to where a face would naturally be. Additionally, a whole strawberry is placed directly on top of the cake, angled like a hat, reinforcing the whimsical character design. This creative editing transforms the cake into a character, consistent with common animation techniques used in digital illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: In the first panel, are the cake creature’s eyes wide open, showing surprise, and is the dialogue “Who ate my delicious corner?!” present in a speech bubble?",
    "explanation": "In the first panel of Image B, the cake character displays wide-open eyes with raised eyebrows, a classic visual cue for surprise or shock. A speech bubble is attached to the character containing the text: 'Who at my delicious corner?' While the phrase is slightly different from 'Who ate my delicious corner?!', the intent and meaning are nearly identical — both express alarm over a missing piece of cake. The slight variation may be due to OCR or transcription error, but visually, the message is clearly about someone having taken a bite. Given the context and the character's expression, the sentiment matches the expected dialogue closely enough to confirm the intended meaning.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: In Panel 1, are there faint silhouettes of utensils (such as spoons or forks) visible in the background, suggesting a party setting?",
    "explanation": "In the right portion of the first panel of Image B, behind the cake character, there is a light gray background featuring faint, stylized silhouettes of kitchen utensils — including what appear to be a spoon, fork, knife, and possibly a ladle. These are arranged in a row and are semi-transparent, creating a subtle decorative backdrop. This detail contributes to a festive or culinary theme, implying a party or dining setting. Such imagery is commonly used in cartoons to suggest a thematic environment without distracting from the main character. Thus, the presence of these utensil silhouettes supports the idea of a party atmosphere.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: In Panel 2, does the cake creature appear to be shaking its head, has the dialogue “No more free bites, time for dessert defense!” been added, and are strawberries and garnishes arranged as bodyguards and a shield?",
    "explanation": "In the lower-left section of Panel 2, the cake character is depicted with a stern expression, eyebrows furrowed, and arms raised in a defensive posture. While it doesn’t literally show motion, the pose suggests resistance or defiance, consistent with 'shaking its head' metaphorically. The speech bubble contains the text: 'No more free pits, time for dessert defense!' — a playful pun on 'pits' (likely meant to be 'bites') and 'defense'. Despite the typo ('pits' instead of 'bites'), the message is clear and humorous. On the right side of the panel, a superhero figure stands behind a shield decorated with strawberries and green leaves, resembling a wreath. Additional strawberry-topped figures flank the cake character, serving as bodyguards. This entire setup is a creative representation of a 'dessert defense' team, using edible elements as armor and allies. Therefore, all elements described are present, albeit with a minor textual error.",
    "answer": "Yes"
