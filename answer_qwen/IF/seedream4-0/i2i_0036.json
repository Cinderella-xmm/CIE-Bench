        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is a plush toy designed to resemble a black cat. The fur appears uniformly black across its body, consistent with the typical appearance of a black cat. The material looks like soft fabric, commonly used in stuffed toys, and there are no visible patches or discolorations that would suggest a change in fur color. Based on visual inspection, the figure maintains the black fur characteristic of the original cat from Image A. This conclusion is supported by common knowledge about plush toys, which often replicate the coloration of real animals accurately.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collectible figure is wearing a pair of black-framed glasses with yellow lenses that match the eyes of the cat. These glasses are clearly visible and positioned over the eyes, suggesting they are part of the figure's design. Glasses are not present in Image A, where the real cat does not wear any accessories. The addition of glasses aligns with common trends in designer toys, where accessories like eyewear are used to give characters a scholarly or professional appearance. This indicates that glasses were intentionally added as part of the transformation into a stylized collectible.",

      "question": "Is there a notebook prop added next to or under the collectible figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two spiral-bound notebooks are visible. One is held by the figure’s paw, while the other lies on the floor near its front paws. These notebooks appear to be props, likely made of paper or cardboard, and are positioned to suggest that the figure is engaged in writing or reading. In contrast, Image A shows no such objects—only a tie and a carpeted floor. The inclusion of notebooks enhances the 'working' theme of the figure, which is common in desktop decor items meant to evoke productivity or professionalism. Thus, the notebooks are clearly added props in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the collectible figure posed in a lying down position that suggests a working posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The collectible figure in Image B is lying on its side on the floor, with one arm extended forward holding a notebook, and another notebook placed nearby. This pose mimics a relaxed yet focused working stance, often seen in depictions of people or characters engaged in study or office work. The positioning of the limbs and the presence of the notebook reinforce the idea of a 'working' posture. In comparison, the real cat in Image A is also lying down but in a more passive, restful manner without any interaction with objects. The edited version transforms the natural resting pose into a stylized, purposeful one, consistent with the aesthetic of designer toys meant to represent productivity.",

      "question": "Does the collectible figure exhibit characteristics of a trendy desktop designer toy, such as a polished finish and stylish design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The collectible figure in Image B features several elements typical of modern designer toys: a sleek black fabric finish, fashionable accessories (glasses and a patterned tie), and a posed, narrative-driven setup involving notebooks. These attributes reflect current trends in collectible art toys, which often blend cuteness with sophistication and are marketed as desk companions or decorative items. The attention to detail—such as the realistic eye design, the precise placement of the tie, and the overall composition—suggests a high-quality, intentional design. In contrast, the real cat in Image A lacks these curated stylistic elements. Therefore, the figure in Image B clearly embodies the traits of a trendy desktop designer toy.",
