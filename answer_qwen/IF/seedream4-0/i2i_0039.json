      "question": "Does the edited version retain the original photo subjects (polar bear and cubs in an icy setting)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual content of Image B clearly shows a polar bear with two cubs standing on a large expanse of ice, surrounded by water. The animals are positioned similarly to how they might appear in a natural Arctic environment. Based on world knowledge, polar bears are native to Arctic regions and rely on sea ice for hunting and survival. The presence of the mother bear and her cubs on ice, along with the surrounding deep blue ocean, aligns with typical wildlife photography of polar bears in their natural habitat. There is no indication that the subjects have been altered or replaced; they remain consistent with the original scene. Therefore, the original subjects are retained.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the color tone of the image been slightly cooled to include more blue and white hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the overall color palette emphasizes cool tones—specifically shades of blue in the water and enhanced white and light blue in the ice. This cooling effect enhances the sense of coldness and isolation, which is often used in environmental advocacy imagery to evoke emotional responses related to climate change. While the original image may have had similar colors, the edited version appears to amplify the contrast between the deep blue water and the bright white ice, possibly through post-processing adjustments such as increased saturation or color grading. This is a common technique in environmental messaging to emphasize the fragility of polar ecosystems. Thus, the color tone has indeed been adjusted to emphasize cooler hues.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a bold headline reading “Only Ice Left. Nowhere to Go.” located in the top right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, text is visible in the upper right quadrant. It reads 'Only Ice Left. Nowhere to Go.' in a bold, white font that stands out against the dark blue background of the water. The placement is consistent with the top right corner, and the phrasing is direct and impactful, typical of environmental awareness campaigns. This text serves as a message about the consequences of melting ice due to climate change, reinforcing the visual narrative of stranded polar bears. Given its prominence and positioning, it matches the description exactly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom center of Image B, there is a circular logo with a stylized design incorporating green and blue elements, resembling a globe or leaf motif, which is commonly associated with environmental organizations. Next to it, the text 'climateaction.org' is displayed, followed by the full URL 'www.climateaction.org'. This inclusion is typical of advocacy posters, where branding and contact information are placed to direct viewers to further resources. The presence of both the logo and website confirms that this image is part of a campaign by an environmental group.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a serious and realistic style, avoiding exaggerated or cartoonish elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a high-resolution photograph of real polar bears in a naturalistic setting. The lighting, shadows, and textures of the ice and fur appear authentic, suggesting minimal digital manipulation beyond color adjustment and text overlay. The composition is straightforward, focusing on the animals’ vulnerability without adding fantastical or exaggerated elements. The addition of text is informative and somber, aligning with the serious tone of climate change messaging. There are no cartoonish features, distortions, or surreal effects. This approach is consistent with documentary-style environmental advocacy, aiming to evoke empathy through realism rather than dramatization.",
