      "question": "Is the image now presented as a rectangular object with defined edges, consistent with a fridge magnet format?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a clearly defined rectangular shape with rounded corners, resembling a framed decorative plaque or relief. The object has distinct edges and appears to be mounted on a flat surface, suggesting it is a physical item rather than a standalone digital image. This form factor—rectangular with a border and uniform thickness—is consistent with common fridge magnet designs, especially those made from resin or ceramic materials. Additionally, the presence of a gold-colored trim around the perimeter reinforces the idea that this is a bounded, tangible object intended for display or attachment. Based on visual cues such as the framing, depth, and shadowing, it is reasonable to conclude that the image has been transformed into a format suitable for a fridge magnet.",

      "question": "Does the magnet feature Art Nouveau-style decorative elements such as swirling floral patterns, curvilinear forms, or stylized plant motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Art Nouveau design is characterized by organic lines, flowing curves, and natural motifs such as flowers, vines, and foliage. In Image B, the background behind the woman includes intricate, swirling patterns that resemble stylized plant forms and ornamental arches—hallmarks of the Art Nouveau style. These patterns are not geometric but instead follow fluid, sinuous lines typical of the movement. Additionally, the frame itself incorporates decorative flourishes that mimic tendrils and leaves, further reinforcing the Art Nouveau aesthetic. The vases and floral sprigs depicted also reflect stylized botanical elements common in this art style. Thus, the visual evidence strongly supports the presence of Art Nouveau design elements.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the woman’s dress still present with visible fabric folds and rendered in pastel tones (e.g., soft white, beige, light blue)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is depicted wearing a long, flowing gown with detailed draping and visible fabric folds, particularly along the sleeves and train. The coloration of the dress includes soft hues such as off-white, pale beige, and subtle hints of light blue and pink—colors that fall within the pastel range. These tones are consistent with the delicate, ethereal palette often used in Art Nouveau depictions of female figures. Although the medium is now three-dimensional relief, the rendering preserves the texture and shading necessary to convey the fabric’s flow and softness. Therefore, the dress remains present and accurately rendered in appropriate pastel tones.",

      "question": "Are the edges of the magnet outlined or trimmed with gold-colored detailing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the outer perimeter of the rectangular object features a thin, continuous band of gold-colored material that outlines the entire frame. This golden trim is consistent in width and finish, suggesting intentional decorative enhancement. Such metallic outlining is commonly used in decorative plaques and magnets to add elegance and define the boundaries of the artwork. Given the artistic style and presentation, the gold trim serves both an aesthetic and functional purpose, reinforcing the object's appearance as a refined collectible or decorative item. The visual evidence confirms the presence of gold-colored detailing along the edges.",

      "question": "Do the colors in the magnet (dress, background, trim) form a harmonious and unified palette dominated by soft, warm, or earthy tones consistent with Art Nouveau aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall color scheme in Image B consists of muted, blended tones including cream, beige, soft blues, pale pinks, and golden accents. These colors are harmoniously balanced and create a cohesive visual experience. Art Nouveau frequently employed such subdued, naturalistic palettes to evoke elegance and organic beauty. The warm undertones in the dress and background, combined with the golden trim, align with the movement’s preference for earthy and luminous hues. There is no jarring contrast or bright, unnatural coloring; instead, the palette feels unified and intentionally curated. This consistency supports the conclusion that the color scheme adheres to Art Nouveau principles.",

      "question": "Does the background of the magnet contain floral motifs and gentle arches typical of Art Nouveau design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features elaborate, interwoven patterns that include stylized floral elements, such as blossoms and leaf-like forms, integrated into the architectural framework surrounding the central figure. These motifs are arranged in flowing, asymmetrical compositions characteristic of Art Nouveau. Additionally, the arched window-like structure behind the woman is softened with curved lines and ornamental detailing, forming gentle arches that contribute to the overall organic feel. These design choices—floral motifs combined with graceful arches—are quintessential features of Art Nouveau architecture and decorative arts. Thus, the background clearly reflects these stylistic hallmarks.",
