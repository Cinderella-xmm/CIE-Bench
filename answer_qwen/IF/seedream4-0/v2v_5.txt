    "Question": "Q1: Is the zebra depicted in a stylized 3D chibi form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is rendered with exaggerated proportions typical of chibi art style—large head, oversized eyes, small body, and simplified features. The design is cartoonish and three-dimensional, resembling a toy or digital character rather than a realistic animal. This aligns with the chibi aesthetic commonly seen in anime and playful digital illustrations. The smooth textures, rounded edges, and lack of anatomical detail further support this interpretation.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the zebra’s stripes and distinctive pattern accurately depicted as in the original photo?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are present and follow the general black-and-white pattern characteristic of real zebras. However, they are stylized and simplified to fit the chibi aesthetic—less precise and more uniform in width and spacing than in real-life zebras. In contrast, Image A shows a realistic zebra with natural, irregular stripe patterns that vary in thickness and alignment. While both images depict zebra-like striping, Image B prioritizes artistic stylization over biological accuracy. Therefore, the depiction is not accurate in terms of realism but retains the iconic pattern.",
    "answer": "No"

The zebra appears to be reaching toward the cake with one front leg extended, suggesting interaction. The cake is significantly smaller than in Image A, indicating it is a miniature version. The overall scene conveys a playful tone, consistent with a whimsical, social media-style image. This behavior is consistent with playful engagement.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the zebra leaning forward with a curious look while seated on the edge of an oversized Instagram frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is clearly seated on the lower edge of a large, stylized Instagram interface. Its posture shows it leaning forward slightly, with its head turned toward the cake, giving it a curious and engaged expression. The eyes are wide and focused, reinforcing the impression of curiosity. The frame itself is oversized relative to the zebra, creating a surreal, playful composition typical of meme or digital art styles. This visual arrangement supports the description in the question.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the top section of the Instagram frame feature the username “ZebraLover”?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top portion of the Instagram-style frame displays a profile name beneath the Instagram logo. The text clearly reads 'ZebraLover,' matching the query exactly. This is consistent with the design of Instagram posts, where usernames appear at the top of the post interface. The font and placement are also aligned with standard Instagram UI elements.",

    "explanation": "In Image B, several social media icons are visible around the Instagram frame.

Additionally, there are icons for liking, commenting, and sharing located beneath the image within the frame. These elements mimic common Instagram interface features and are arranged to simulate user interaction. Thus, various social media icons are indeed present and floating around the scene.",
