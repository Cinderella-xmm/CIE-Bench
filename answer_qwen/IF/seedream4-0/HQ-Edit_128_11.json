      "question": "Is the image styled as a vintage theater program cover, with a flattened, illustrative appearance resembling a printed poster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image exhibits characteristics typical of a vintage theater program cover. The overall composition is stylized and flattened, lacking the depth and photorealistic detail seen in standard photographs. The use of a sepia tone, combined with a textured background that mimics aged paper, reinforces the vintage aesthetic. Additionally, the central piano is framed within a minimalist border, a common design choice in illustrative posters. These elements collectively suggest an intentional artistic treatment aimed at evoking the feel of a printed poster or program from a bygone era. This analysis is supported by visual cues such as the uniform lighting, lack of realistic shadows, and deliberate placement of text and graphic elements.",

      "question": "Has the chandelier been modified to include additional ornate decorative elements such as scrollwork or intricate metalwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the chandelier in Image B, it retains a classic, ornate structure consistent with traditional crystal chandeliers found in grand theaters. However, there are no visible additions such as extra scrollwork, intricate metal filigree, or other decorative embellishments beyond what would be typical for such a fixture. The chandelier appears to be rendered with standard symmetry and candle-like lights, without any noticeable modifications that go beyond its original design. Comparing this to Image A, where the chandelier also appears detailed but not overly embellished, confirms that no significant new decorative elements have been added in Image B. Thus, the chandelier remains true to its classical form without additional ornamental features.",

      "question": "Are there newly added intricate patterns (such as floral or geometric designs) on the ceiling surface, particularly surrounding the central dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ceiling in Image B shows a simplified, stylized representation of the dome. While there is a circular pattern around the central chandelier, it lacks the intricate floral or geometric designs present in Image A, which features elaborate gilded patterns and fresco-like details. In Image B, the ceiling texture appears more uniform and less detailed, resembling a faded or aged illustration rather than a richly decorated surface. The absence of distinct floral motifs or complex geometric shapes suggests that no new intricate patterns have been added. Instead, the design has been reduced to a basic outline to maintain the vintage poster aesthetic. Therefore, based on both visual evidence and comparison to Image A, no newly added intricate patterns are present.",

      "question": "Have all audience members been rendered as solid black or dark silhouettes without visible facial features or clothing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the audience members are depicted as dark silhouettes, uniformly shaded in black or very dark tones. There is no visible detail regarding facial features, clothing textures, or individual expressions. This stylistic choice emphasizes anonymity and contributes to the illustrative, poster-like quality of the image. Unlike Image A, where audience members are clearly rendered with distinct clothing, postures, and facial details, Image B simplifies them into shadowy figures. This transformation aligns with common techniques used in vintage-style promotional materials to focus attention on the central subject—the piano—while maintaining a sense of atmosphere without distracting details. Thus, all audience members have indeed been rendered as solid dark silhouettes.",

      "question": "Does the entire image exhibit a consistent sepia tone, with dominant warm brown and yellow hues and minimal contrast from cooler colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is dominated by a warm, monochromatic color palette consisting primarily of browns and yellows, characteristic of a sepia tone. This effect gives the image an aged, nostalgic appearance commonly associated with historical documents or vintage prints. There is minimal presence of cooler colors such as blues or greens; even shadows are rendered in darker shades of brown rather than cool grays or blacks. The lighting across the entire scene is consistent with this warm filter, affecting the chandelier, piano, ceiling, and floor uniformly. Compared to Image A, which features richer contrasts and a broader color spectrum (including deep golds, dark blues, and highlights), Image B’s palette is deliberately restricted to create a cohesive, timeless look. Hence, the image does exhibit a consistent sepia tone with dominant warm hues and minimal contrast from cooler tones.",

      "question": "Is the grand piano positioned centrally in the foreground and visually emphasized as the primary focal point of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grand piano in Image B is positioned directly in the center of the frame, occupying a prominent place in the foreground. It is visually emphasized through several design choices: it is the only object in sharp focus, surrounded by a thin rectangular border that draws attention to it, and its silhouette stands out against the softer background. The perspective lines of the stage and seating converge toward the piano, reinforcing its role as the focal point. Unlike Image A, where the piano is also central but integrated into a more realistic setting with surrounding details, Image B isolates the piano through compositional and stylistic means. This deliberate emphasis ensures that the viewer’s attention is immediately drawn to the instrument, making it the primary subject of the image.",

      "question": "Is the phrase “AN EVENING OF CLASSICAL MAJESTY” present at the top of the image in a serif font style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, the phrase “AN EVENING OF CLASSICAL MAJESTY” is clearly visible. The font used is a serif typeface, characterized by small decorative strokes at the ends of letters, which is typical of formal and classical typography often used in vintage event promotions. The text is centered and placed above the chandelier, following a common layout for theatrical program titles. In contrast, Image A does not contain any text, so the presence of this title is a clear addition in Image B. The choice of serif font enhances the elegant, traditional feel of the image, aligning with the theme of classical music and grandeur. Therefore, the phrase is indeed present and styled in a serif font.",
