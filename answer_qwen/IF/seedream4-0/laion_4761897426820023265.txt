    "Question": "Q1: Is the Great Wall and surrounding mountains rendered as a miniature 3D model rather than a full-scale photograph?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Great Wall and surrounding mountains are clearly depicted within a transparent spherical enclosure, which is characteristic of a snow globe. The scale of the landscape is significantly reduced compared to real-world proportions, with exaggerated details such as tiny human figures and stylized trees. This indicates that the scene is not a full-scale photograph but a miniature 3D model designed to fit inside the globe. The visual cues—such as the uniform lighting, artificial textures, and lack of depth typical of wide-angle photography—support this conclusion. Additionally, the presence of snow particles and birds in flight further suggests a crafted, enclosed environment rather than a natural outdoor setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the miniature model of the Great Wall and mountains enclosed within a transparent, spherical snow globe?",
    "explanation": "The image shows a spherical, transparent object containing a detailed representation of the Great Wall winding through mountainous terrain. The structure is clearly encased in glass or crystal, with visible reflections and refractions consistent with a snow globe. The base supports the sphere, and the entire setup matches the form factor of a traditional snow globe. The transparency allows full visibility of the internal model, confirming that it is enclosed within a spherical container.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are there small-scale human figures depicted walking along the Great Wall inside the snow globe, with visible details such as clothing or accessories?",
    "explanation": "Inside the snow globe, multiple tiny human figures are visible walking along the path of the Great Wall. These figures are proportionally small relative to the surrounding landscape, consistent with a miniature model. Upon closer inspection, they appear to have distinct clothing colors (e.g., red, blue, green) and some seem to carry backpacks or wear hats, indicating attention to detail in their design. While the resolution limits fine detail, the presence of varied attire and accessories suggests deliberate modeling for realism within the context of a souvenir item.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are areas of the landscape inside the snow globe adorned with bright autumn-colored foliage (e.g., red, orange, yellow leaves)?",
    "explanation": "The trees within the snow globe display vivid fall colors, including shades of red, orange, and yellow. These colors are concentrated around the base of the mountains and along the sides of the Great Wall path, creating a seasonal atmosphere. Such coloration is typical of autumn foliage and contrasts with the more muted greens seen in real-life mountain environments during other seasons. The intentional use of these bright hues suggests artistic styling to evoke a picturesque autumn scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a visible swirling snow effect inside the snow globe, with tiny white particles appearing to float or fall?",
    "explanation": "Within the snow globe, numerous small white particles are suspended in the air, particularly near the top and sides of the sphere. Some of these particles appear to be in motion, forming spiral patterns that suggest a swirling effect. This is consistent with the behavior of snowflakes in a shaken snow globe, where water-based suspension creates floating particles. The dynamic appearance of these particles enhances the illusion of falling snow, reinforcing the idea of a winter-themed souvenir.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there small, ceramic-looking birds depicted in flight inside the snow globe?",
    "explanation": "Three bird figures are visible inside the snow globe, positioned mid-flight above the landscape. They have defined wings, bodies, and beaks, with coloration resembling white and blue feathers. Their rigid poses and smooth surfaces suggest they are made of ceramic or plastic, typical materials used in decorative models. Their placement in the air and orientation imply flight, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static scene. These features align with common design choices in collectible snow globes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the snow globe placed on a dark wooden base?",
    "explanation": "The snow globe rests on a circular, polished base that appears to be made of dark wood. The surface has a rich brown tone with visible grain patterns, and its reflective quality suggests a lacquered finish. The shape and material are consistent with traditional snow globe bases, designed both for stability and aesthetic appeal. There is no indication of metal or plastic, supporting the conclusion that it is wooden.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the phrase 'Great Wall Memories' visibly engraved on the wooden base?",
    "explanation": "On the front of the wooden base, the words 'Great Wall Memories' are clearly inscribed in gold lettering. The font is elegant and slightly raised, suggesting engraving or inlay. This text serves as a label identifying the theme of the snow globe and likely functions as a souvenir message. Its placement and legibility confirm that it is intentionally displayed for viewers.",
    "answer": "Yes"
