      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the perfume bottle appears to be a hybrid construction. While the base and cap sections incorporate Lego bricks—evident from the visible studs and block-like geometry—the central body of the bottle retains a transparent, faceted glass appearance that mimics real crystal. The golden cap also features Lego-style elements, such as stacked pieces with stud connectors. However, the main body of the bottle is not made of Lego bricks but rather a transparent material designed to look like glass, with a pattern that matches the original bottle's texture. Therefore, the bottle is not constructed entirely out of Lego bricks. This conclusion is based on visual cues such as the transparency, reflections, and lack of studs or interlocking structure on the main body.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric background has been partially reconstructed using Lego bricks. The brown, wavy surface beneath the perfume bottle contains visible Lego elements, including red and brown bricks arranged in patterns that mimic the folds of fabric. However, the texture and flow of the fabric still retain a soft, silky appearance in some areas, suggesting that the Lego recreation is only partial. The fabric’s undulating form is simulated by Lego blocks, but the overall aesthetic blends real fabric with Lego elements. Thus, while Lego bricks are used to recreate parts of the fabric, it is not fully reconstructed using only Lego bricks. This determination comes from identifying the distinct textures and structures typical of Lego bricks versus natural fabric.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the original composition and positioning of the perfume bottle and fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the perfume bottle remains in the same central position, with the same orientation and lighting direction. The spray mist emanating from the nozzle is also present in both images, maintaining the dynamic element of the scene. The fabric background in both images has a similar color and general flow, though in Image B, parts of it are replaced with Lego bricks. Despite these modifications, the overall composition—including the placement of the bottle, the angle of light, and the direction of the spray—remains consistent with the original. This suggests that the edit preserves the core composition and positioning, even if the materials have changed. The reasoning involves analyzing spatial relationships and visual continuity between the two images.",

      "question": "Are the details of the perfume bottle, including the cap and spray mechanism, accurately represented using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap and spray mechanism of the perfume bottle in Image B are represented with Lego bricks, showing attention to detail. The golden cap is constructed from multiple Lego pieces, including a faceted top resembling a gemstone, which closely mimics the original design. The spray nozzle is also depicted with a small black piece extending from the side, simulating the spray function. These elements are carefully assembled to resemble the original bottle's intricate design. However, the accuracy is limited by the modular nature of Lego bricks; for example, the smooth curves of the original cap are approximated with angular blocks. Nonetheless, the representation is faithful enough to convey the essence of the original design. This analysis combines visual inspection of the Lego construction with knowledge of how Lego pieces can simulate complex shapes.",

      "question": "Is the stop-motion diorama style consistently applied to both the perfume bottle and the fabric background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stop-motion diorama style is evident in the use of Lego bricks to create a realistic yet stylized scene. The perfume bottle incorporates Lego elements in its cap and base, contributing to the diorama effect. Similarly, the fabric background is partially rebuilt using Lego bricks, particularly in the foreground, where the folds are formed by stacked pieces. However, the transition between real fabric and Lego elements is not seamless—some areas retain the texture of actual silk, while others are clearly composed of bricks. This inconsistency means the stop-motion diorama style is applied selectively rather than uniformly across both the bottle and the fabric. The reasoning involves evaluating the extent to which both objects adhere to the same artistic technique, which in this case is only partially achieved.",
