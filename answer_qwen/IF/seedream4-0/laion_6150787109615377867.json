      "question": "Has the tabletop been replaced with a gear-shaped component featuring visible teeth and intricate engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop is no longer a simple flat circular surface. Instead, it is a complex, multi-layered mechanical structure resembling a large gear or cogwheel. The outer edge clearly shows prominent gear teeth, and the surface is adorned with ornate engravings and mechanical details such as smaller gears, rivets, and decorative filigree patterns. These visual cues are consistent with steampunk aesthetics, where industrial machinery is stylized with elaborate designs. This transformation from a plain metallic surface to a functional-looking gear with detailed engravings indicates that the tabletop has indeed been replaced with a gear-shaped component.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the table legs been morphed into articulated, piston-driven limbs with visible joints and brass or copper-colored accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original table in Image A has four fixed, star-shaped metal legs that are rigid and non-articulated. In contrast, Image B shows that the legs have been transformed into complex, jointed structures resembling robotic limbs. These limbs feature multiple pivot points, cylindrical pistons, coiled springs (resembling hydraulic or pneumatic components), and are constructed with a combination of brass, copper, and darkened steel materials. The presence of visible hinges, ball joints, and segmented sections suggests articulation and mechanical movement. The coloration—especially the golden brass and reddish copper tones—further supports the idea of piston-driven limbs typical of steampunk engineering. This is a significant departure from the static, unjointed legs in the original image.",

      "question": "Are there visible steam vents placed along the central column of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central column of the table is intricately designed with various mechanical elements. Near the top of the column, two vertical pipes are emitting plumes of white steam, which are clearly visible against the dark background. These pipes resemble steam vents commonly found in steam-powered machines. Their placement on the upper part of the central shaft, along with the surrounding gears and valves, strongly suggests they function as steam outlets. This detail aligns with the steampunk theme, where steam propulsion and visible vapor emissions are key aesthetic and functional features. No such steam vents exist in Image A, which is a plain metallic structure without any signs of active mechanisms.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the base feature intricate cog patterns and at least one rotating dial or gauge element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the structure in Image B is not a simple flat platform but a complex mechanical assembly. It is covered with numerous interlocking gears of varying sizes, all arranged in an intricate pattern that evokes a sense of perpetual motion. Among these cogs, two small circular dials are clearly visible, each with hands and numerical markings resembling clocks or pressure gauges. These dials appear to be integrated into the base's design and likely serve as functional indicators within the machine’s operation. Such elements are common in steampunk art to suggest measurement and control systems. In contrast, the base in Image A is a plain, unadorned star-shaped metal plate with no mechanical details or dials.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the metal table been transformed into a coherent, steampunk-style mechanized creature with integrated mechanical features resembling a living machine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a highly stylized and imaginative transformation of the original table. The entire structure now resembles a sentient or animated machine, with articulated limbs that mimic biological legs, a central body housing mechanical organs (like steam vents and piping), and a gear-based 'head' or platform. The integration of moving parts, steam emission, clockwork motifs, and brass/copper finishes all contribute to a steampunk aesthetic that anthropomorphizes the object. The symmetry, complexity, and apparent functionality of the limbs and base suggest a living machine rather than a static piece of furniture. This contrasts sharply with Image A, which is a minimalist, utilitarian metal table with no mechanical or animate qualities. The transformation is complete and coherent, forming a believable steampunk construct that behaves like a mechanized organism.",
