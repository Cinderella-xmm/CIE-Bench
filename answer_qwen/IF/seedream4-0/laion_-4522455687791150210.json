      "question": "Is the woman depicted as a marble statue rather than a living person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B exhibits characteristics typical of a marble statue. The skin tone is uniformly pale and veined with gray patterns resembling natural marble, which is inconsistent with human skin. Additionally, the texture across the body, including the limbs and face, lacks the softness and subtle shading associated with living flesh. The hands are posed stiffly, and the overall form has a polished, sculpted appearance. These visual cues, combined with common knowledge about classical sculptures, strongly suggest that the figure is not a living person but a marble statue.",

      "question": "Is the figure in an elegant, balanced standing pose characteristic of classical sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure stands with one leg slightly forward and the weight shifted to one side, creating a contrapposto stance—a hallmark of classical sculpture. The arms are positioned naturally, with one hand resting on the hip and the other gently draped along the body, contributing to a sense of balance and grace. This pose is consistent with Greco-Roman statuary, where figures are often depicted in dynamic yet poised positions to convey elegance and harmony. Based on these visual elements and historical knowledge of classical art, the pose is indeed characteristic of classical sculpture.",

      "question": "Are the folds of the saree intricately detailed and rendered to suggest movement and flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The saree in Image B displays deep, flowing folds with varying thicknesses and shadows that simulate drapery in motion. The fabric appears to drape over the body in a way that follows anatomical contours, with creases and overlaps suggesting natural movement. The rendering includes highlights and lowlights that enhance the three-dimensional quality, giving the impression of soft, flowing material. These details align with artistic techniques used in classical sculpture to depict textiles realistically. Therefore, the folds are intricately detailed and convey a sense of movement and flow.",

      "question": "Is there a classical-style pedestal beneath the statue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure stands on a circular base made of the same marble-like material as the statue itself. The pedestal features decorative molding at its top edge and a fluted design near the bottom, consistent with neoclassical or Renaissance architectural styles commonly seen in museum settings. This type of support structure is typical for displaying statues in grand halls, reinforcing the idea that it is a classical-style pedestal. Thus, based on both visual cues and architectural knowledge, the presence of a classical-style pedestal is confirmed.",

      "question": "Is the saree entirely rendered in marble texture, including patterns and borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the main body of the saree appears to be carved from marble, the intricate patterns and borders—such as the blue and gold designs—do not seem to be part of the marble itself. Instead, they appear to be painted or overlaid onto the surface, maintaining their color contrast against the white marble. In true marble sculptures, such vivid colors would not typically be present unless artificially added. Since the patterns retain distinct hues (blue, gold) rather than being etched into the stone, they are likely not fully integrated into the marble texture. Hence, the saree is not entirely rendered in marble texture.",

      "question": "Are the necklace and earrings represented as engraved or incised details on the marble surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The necklace and earrings in Image B have visible red gemstones and metallic components, which stand out against the marble surface. They appear to be three-dimensional objects attached to the statue, possibly modeled as separate elements rather than engraved into the stone. Engraved details would lack volume and depth, but here the jewelry has defined edges and reflective qualities, indicating they are either sculpted separately or digitally enhanced. Given this observation and knowledge of how jewelry is typically portrayed in sculptures (often as attached elements), the accessories are not merely incised details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B shows a spacious interior with high ceilings, arched doorways, ornate moldings, and chandeliers—features characteristic of classical or baroque palatial architecture. The floor is tiled with geometric patterns, and large windows allow natural light to enter, enhancing the grandeur of the space. Such environments are typical of European royal palaces or museums housing classical artworks. Combined with the statue’s placement and style, the setting clearly reflects an ornate palace hall with classical architectural elements.",
