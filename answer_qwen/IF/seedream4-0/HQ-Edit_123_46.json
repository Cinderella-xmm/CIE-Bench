      "question": "Is the basketball player depicted in a mid-dribble pose with the ball near the ground and body in motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basketball player is shown in an athletic stance with one leg bent and the other extended, suggesting movement. The basketball is held in his right hand, positioned slightly above the knee level but not near the ground, indicating that he is either preparing for or just after a dribble. His body leans forward, and his facial expression shows focus, consistent with active gameplay. However, the ball is not close to the floor as would be typical in a mid-dribble moment. Instead, it appears to be in a controlled hold, possibly during a crossover or pass motion. This suggests that while the player is in motion, the specific action is not a mid-dribble where the ball is bouncing near the ground. Therefore, based on visual cues and common basketball mechanics, this does not depict a true mid-dribble.",

      "question": "Are bold black outlines present around the basketball player, the ball, and other key elements such as the hoop and court?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a strong comic book art style, characterized by thick, high-contrast outlines. The basketball player, the basketball, the hoop, the backboard, and even the court lines are all defined with prominent black outlines. These outlines are consistent with traditional comic illustration techniques, which use bold borders to separate elements and enhance visual clarity. The uniform, facial features, and shadows are also outlined sharply, reinforcing the stylized aesthetic. This is a deliberate artistic choice to emulate vintage comic panels, making the outlines a defining feature of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible dynamic action lines around the player’s legs, arms, or the basketball to emphasize motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, dynamic action lines are clearly visible in Image B. Radiating lines emanate from the player's feet and extend outward along the court, suggesting speed and momentum. Additionally, motion lines trail behind the basketball and appear near the player's arms and legs, enhancing the sense of rapid movement. These lines are typical of comic book art used to convey velocity and energy. They are especially concentrated beneath the player’s feet and around the lower half of his body, reinforcing the idea that he is moving quickly across the court. This stylistic element is purposefully included to dramatize the action.",

      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image vibrant shades of red and orange, particularly in the player’s uniform and surrounding lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette of Image B is dominated by intense reds and oranges. The background features a fiery red gradient, with bright orange highlights simulating stadium lights. The player's uniform includes orange trim and accents, complementing the black jersey. The court itself has a vivid orange hue, and the lighting casts warm tones across the scene. These colors are not only visually striking but also contribute to the energetic, dramatic atmosphere typical of retro comic book covers. The use of red and orange enhances the sense of excitement and intensity, aligning with the 'showdown' theme suggested by the text.",

      "question": "Is there visible text overlaid on the image in a retro-style font that suggests a fictional game title (e.g., \"Hoops Fever '87\")?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, there is prominent text overlaid on the image. On the right side, the words 'FANTASY COURT SHOWDOWN' are displayed in a bold, angular, retro-style font reminiscent of 1980s arcade games or vintage sports posters. Below that, the phrase 'CHALK DOWN' appears in a similarly stylized, blocky font with a distressed texture and shadow effects. Both phrases are designed to evoke nostalgia and suggest a fictional or themed basketball event. While not exactly 'Hoops Fever '87', the overall typography and phrasing strongly imply a fictional game title, consistent with the comic book aesthetic and marketing tone.",

      "question": "Does the entire image have a distinct comic panel border (e.g., a thick frame with possible decorative corners) surrounding it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, Image B is framed by a thick, cream-colored border with a clean, rectangular outline, resembling a classic comic book panel. This border is uniformly wide and separates the artwork from the outer edge, giving it the appearance of a standalone panel or poster. The corners are sharp and unadorned, but the presence of the frame itself is unmistakable and serves to contain the action within a defined space. This framing technique is standard in comic book design and helps emphasize the illustrative nature of the image.",
