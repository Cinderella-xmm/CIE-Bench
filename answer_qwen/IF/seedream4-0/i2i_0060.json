        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Michelin-style plating is characterized by meticulous presentation, symmetry, artistic arrangement, and attention to detail. In Image B, the food is arranged with precision: a spiral-cut steak is centered on a white plate, surrounded by evenly spaced carrot slices forming a circular pattern. Each carrot slice has a small dot of sauce, adding visual contrast and elegance. This level of symmetry, balance, and aesthetic appeal aligns closely with high-end culinary presentation standards often seen in Michelin-starred restaurants. The careful composition and use of color contrast (orange carrots against white plate and dark sauce) further support this conclusion. Therefore, based on visual cues and common knowledge of fine dining aesthetics, the plating qualifies as Michelin-style.",

      "question": "Is the steak spiral-rolled?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central piece of meat displays a distinct spiral pattern when viewed from above, with concentric layers visible in cross-section. This spiral structure indicates that the meat was rolled tightly before cooking, a technique commonly used in preparing dishes like beef roulade or prime rib roll. The evenness of the spiral and the layered appearance confirm that it is indeed spiral-rolled. This is consistent with culinary techniques where meat is marinated, seasoned, rolled, and then cooked to achieve both flavor distribution and an attractive presentation. The visual evidence strongly supports this conclusion.",

      "question": "Are the carrots cut into a fan-shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carrots in Image B are sliced into thin, wedge-shaped pieces arranged in a circular pattern around the central meat. While they resemble fans due to their radial placement, each individual piece is not shaped like a fan but rather a triangular or conical slice. A true 'fan-shape' typically refers to a broader, curved shape resembling a hand-held fan, which these carrots do not have. Instead, they are uniformly cut into elongated triangles. Therefore, while the overall arrangement may suggest a fan-like design, the individual carrots themselves are not cut into a fan-shape.",

      "question": "Have sauce dots been added to each vegetable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each carrot slice in Image B has a small, round dollop of red sauce placed at its tip. There are exactly 20 carrot slices, and each one contains a sauce dot. This uniform application suggests intentional garnishing for visual appeal and flavor enhancement. The consistency in size and placement across all vegetables confirms that sauce dots were deliberately added to every single piece. This is a common practice in gourmet plating to add color, texture, and taste contrast. Based on the visual evidence, the answer is clear.",

      "question": "Is the food served on a large white ceramic plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dish presented on a wide, circular, white plate with a smooth surface and slightly raised rim. The material appears to be ceramic, as indicated by its glossy finish and clean edgesâ€”typical characteristics of fine dining porcelain. The plate's size is sufficient to accommodate the central meat and surrounding carrots without crowding, suggesting it is 'large' relative to standard dinnerware. The combination of color, shape, material, and scale matches the description of a large white ceramic plate commonly used in upscale restaurant settings. No other materials or colors are present that would contradict this assessment.",
