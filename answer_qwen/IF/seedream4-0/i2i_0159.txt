    "Question": "Q1: Has the yellow tennis ball been replaced with a flying disc?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object near the dog is no longer a yellow tennis ball but a white flying disc (frisbee) with a colorful design on its surface. This is evident from the shape and texture of the object — it is flat, circular, and has a distinct rim typical of a frisbee, unlike the fuzzy, spherical appearance of a tennis ball. Based on visual cues and common knowledge about sports equipment, this confirms that the tennis ball has been replaced. The position of the object relative to the dog also suggests motion consistent with a thrown frisbee.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Has a blue bow tie collar been added to the dog?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is wearing a red collar with an additional blue bow tie attached to it. This accessory is clearly visible below the dog’s chin and matches the appearance of a standard bow tie. In contrast, in Image A, the dog only wears a red collar without any bow tie. This indicates that the blue bow tie was added during editing. The presence of such a detail aligns with common pet fashion accessories and is visually consistent with how bow ties are typically worn.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image retain or enhance the fun and vitality seen in the original image?",
    "explanation": "The edited image retains the dynamic energy and joyful expression of the original. The dog is still captured mid-run with an open mouth, showing excitement and playfulness. The addition of the frisbee introduces a new element of active play, which enhances the sense of motion and fun. Moreover, the blue bow tie adds a whimsical, cheerful touch that contributes to the overall lighthearted mood. These edits do not detract from the original vitality; instead, they amplify it by introducing playful elements while maintaining the dog's energetic posture and facial expression.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the flying disc positioned similarly to the original tennis ball near the dog?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the yellow tennis ball is located slightly to the left of the dog’s head, appearing as if it is being chased or about to be caught. In Image B, the flying disc is positioned in a similar spatial location — to the left of the dog’s head and at roughly the same height — suggesting a comparable trajectory and interaction. The angle and distance between the object and the dog are consistent with the original composition, indicating that the positioning has been preserved for continuity. This similarity supports the idea that the edit maintains visual coherence with the original scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Do the flying disc and the blue bow tie collar appear as described in the instructions without unintended distortions?",
    "explanation": "The flying disc appears realistic in shape, size, and orientation, with no visible warping or unnatural edges. It fits naturally within the scene, maintaining proper perspective relative to the dog. The blue bow tie is proportionally sized, symmetrically placed, and blends well with the red collar without any obvious digital artifacts or distortions. Both objects appear cleanly integrated into the image, suggesting careful editing. There are no signs of blurring, pixelation, or misalignment that would indicate poor quality or unintended manipulation. Therefore, both elements appear as intended.",
    "answer": "Yes"
