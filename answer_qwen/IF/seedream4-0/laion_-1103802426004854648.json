      "question": "Is the seahorse made entirely of glass material instead of plush fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse has a glossy, transparent appearance with light reflections and refractions typical of glass or acrylic materials. The surface shows smooth contours and internal textures like bubbles, which are not characteristic of plush fabric. Additionally, the way light passes through the body suggests translucency, a property of glass. The fins and head details also appear rigid and molded rather than soft and stitched, as would be expected in plush fabric. This visual evidence, combined with common knowledge about material properties (e.g., plush fabric is opaque and soft, while glass is transparent and hard), supports the conclusion that the seahorse is made of glass. Comparing this to Image A, where the seahorse is clearly plush with visible stitching, texture, and softness, confirms that Image B represents a different material entirely.",

      "question": "Does the body of the seahorse have a translucent pink glass appearance with visible subtle bubble textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the seahorse in Image B exhibits a translucent pink hue, allowing light to pass through while still maintaining some opacity. The surface contains small, scattered circular patterns resembling bubbles, which are commonly found in hand-blown or molded glass due to trapped air during manufacturing. These textures are consistent with glasswork and are not present in fabric-based toys. The overall sheen and clarity further support the interpretation of glass material. In contrast, Image A shows a solid, non-transparent pink plush body without any bubble-like features, confirming the difference in material and texture between the two images.",

      "question": "Is the belly section made of opaque yellow glass with an etched music note design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The belly section in Image B is indeed yellow and appears to be made of a solid, non-transparent material, suggesting opacity. However, upon closer inspection, it is not fully opaque—it allows some light transmission, indicating it may be semi-transparent rather than completely opaque. The music note design on the belly is clearly visible and appears to be either printed or etched into the surface. Given the context of glass art objects, such designs are often etched or applied directly onto glass. While the term 'etched' might be slightly misleading if the design is printed, the visual evidence strongly supports a glass material with a decorative music note motif. Compared to Image A, where the belly is a solid yellow plastic insert with a printed heart and music note, the version in Image B retains the same musical theme but uses a more refined, glass-like medium.",

      "question": "Are the ribbons on the head and fins made of lavender-colored glass instead of fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ribbons on the head and fins in Image B have a shiny, reflective quality and are integrated seamlessly into the glass structure of the seahorse. They lack the texture, folds, and seam lines typical of fabric ribbons. Instead, they appear to be part of the molded glass itself, colored in lavender and shaped to resemble ribbons. This is consistent with glass art techniques where color is incorporated during molding or layering. In contrast, Image A shows distinct fabric ribbons with visible stitching and soft edges, confirming that the original was made of textile material. Therefore, the ribbons in Image B are clearly made of glass, not fabric.",

      "question": "Is the seahorse placed on a reflective black display stand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse is mounted on a square, black base that reflects the object above it, showing a clear mirror-like surface. This reflection indicates a polished, possibly acrylic or glass-like material with high reflectivity. Such stands are commonly used in display cases for decorative glass figurines to enhance their presentation. The base's sharp edges and clean finish further suggest it is designed for exhibition purposes. In comparison, Image A shows no base at all—the seahorse is presented against a plain background, implying it is meant for play rather than display. Thus, the presence of a reflective black stand in Image B is a significant change from the original.",
