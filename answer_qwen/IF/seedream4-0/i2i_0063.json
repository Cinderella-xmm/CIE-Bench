      "question": "Does the edited image feature a horse in the original pose as the protagonist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is a horse lying down on a textured surface, which appears to be a rug or carpet. The horse is positioned in a relaxed, reclined posture with its head turned slightly to the side, suggesting it is resting. This pose is consistent with a calm, stationary animal. The horse is clearly the focal point of the image, given its size, placement, and prominence in the composition. The term 'original pose' implies that this posture is authentic to the animal's natural behavior when at rest, which aligns with typical equine behavior. Therefore, based on visual cues and common knowledge about horses, the horse is indeed depicted in a natural, resting pose and serves as the protagonist of the scene.",

      "question": "Is the background set in a post-apocalyptic ruined city?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B shows dilapidated buildings, broken structures, debris scattered across the ground, and an overall atmosphere of decay and abandonment. These visual elements—such as crumbling walls, missing windows, and overgrown vegetation—are characteristic of a post-apocalyptic urban environment. The sky is overcast and gray, contributing to a desolate mood often associated with such settings. Additionally, the presence of a partially visible sign that reads 'AREA 7' suggests a restricted or abandoned zone, reinforcing the idea of a ruined city. Based on these observations and world knowledge about post-apocalyptic imagery (e.g., from films like 'Mad Max' or 'The Last of Us'), the setting strongly matches a post-apocalyptic scenario.",

      "question": "Does the title \"LAST RIDE\" appear at the top of the image with a cool-tone filter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, the text 'LAST RIDE' is prominently displayed in bold, capitalized letters. The font style is gritty and weathered, fitting the dystopian theme. The color of the text is dark, almost black, but it contrasts against a blue-gray sky, which contributes to a cool-toned aesthetic. The entire image has a blueish tint, indicating a cool-tone filter applied across the scene. Since the title is integrated into this filtered color scheme, it can be concluded that the title appears with a cool-tone filter, consistent with the overall mood and visual design of the image.",

      "question": "Is there a film rating label present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, there is no visible film rating label such as 'PG', 'R', 'NC-17', or similar symbols typically found in movie posters. While there is a small logo in the bottom-left corner that says 'PLANET PICTURES PRODUCER', this is a production company watermark, not a film rating. Film ratings are usually standardized and placed in specific areas (like the bottom left or right) with distinct icons or text. The absence of such a label confirms that no official film rating is present in the image.",

      "question": "Has the entire image been filtered with a cool tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire image exhibits a consistent blue-gray color cast, particularly noticeable in the sky, shadows, and even the lighting on the horse and remote control. This cool tone enhances the somber, desolate atmosphere of the post-apocalyptic setting. The warm brown tones of the horse are muted by this overlay, and the overall contrast is subdued, which is typical of a cool-tone filter used to evoke melancholy or tension. Such filters are commonly used in cinematic visuals to create mood. Given the uniformity of the color grading across all elements—from the background ruins to the foreground objects—the entire image has indeed been filtered with a cool tone.",
