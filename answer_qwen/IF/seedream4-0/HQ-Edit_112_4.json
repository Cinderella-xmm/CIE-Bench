      "question": "Is the Blue Jay rendered as a miniature sculpture made of a solid material such as ceramic or metal, rather than a live bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Blue Jay exhibits highly uniform and polished surface textures with sharp, clean edges on its feathers, which are inconsistent with natural bird plumage. The colors are vivid but lack the subtle variations and softness typically seen in live birds. Additionally, the bird's posture is static and perfectly balanced, suggesting it is not a living creature but a crafted object. The material appears to have a slight sheen, resembling glazed ceramic or painted resin, commonly used in detailed sculptures. This visual evidence, combined with the context of being displayed under a glass dome (a typical setup for collectible figurines), supports the conclusion that it is a miniature sculpture.",

      "question": "Is the Blue Jay sculpture enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly shows the Blue Jay positioned inside a curved, transparent enclosure that reflects light and surroundings, consistent with the appearance of a glass dome. The dome has a rounded top and sits on a wooden base, forming a sealed display case. This type of structure is commonly used for showcasing delicate or valuable objects, especially in dioramas or terrariums. The reflections and refractions visible on the surface further confirm it is made of glass or a similar transparent material. Thus, the presence of a glass dome is evident.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a wooden perch beneath the sculpture with ivy vines visibly winding upward along it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Blue Jay is perched on a small, textured wooden branch that appears to be part of a larger artificial tree structure. A green vine with heart-shaped leaves, characteristic of ivy, is seen climbing up the side of this structure. The vine wraps around the branch and extends upward, indicating deliberate placement for aesthetic effect. This matches the description of ivy winding upward along the perch, supporting the affirmative answer.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small, stylized, crafted leaves placed around the base or near the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the base of the scene, beneath the perch and surrounding the tree stump, there are several small green leaves scattered among the moss-like material. These leaves appear uniformly shaped and slightly glossy, suggesting they are not real but crafted from materials like polymer clay or plastic. Their placement is intentional and decorative, fitting the theme of a curated miniature environment. This indicates that they are stylized and artificially arranged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a miniature, stylized tree stump present in the scene, positioned near the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To the right of the main perch, there is a small, cylindrical object resembling a cut tree stump. It has a rough texture mimicking bark and a flat top, consistent with a miniature representation of a tree stump. Its size and placement relative to the bird suggest it is part of the diorama’s design. Given its proportions and detail, it is clearly a stylized, crafted element rather than a natural object.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the base of the terrarium covered in a textured, earthy, moss-like material that contrasts with the blue and white colors of the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the glass dome contains a layer of green, fluffy material that closely resembles moss. This material has a naturalistic texture and coloration, providing a rich, earthy contrast to the bright blue and white hues of the Blue Jay sculpture. Such moss-like substances are commonly used in terrariums to simulate natural forest floors. The visual contrast enhances the aesthetic appeal and reinforces the garden-like atmosphere.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the entire scene, including the dome, perch, ivy, leaves, stump, and base, collectively evoke a garden-themed terrarium environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The combination of elements—glass dome, wooden perch, ivy vines, crafted leaves, tree stump, and moss-covered base—creates a cohesive miniature ecosystem reminiscent of a natural garden setting. Each component contributes to a curated, nature-inspired display typical of a terrarium. The careful arrangement and use of organic materials suggest an intentional effort to replicate a forest floor microhabitat. Therefore, the overall composition strongly evokes a garden-themed terrarium environment.",
