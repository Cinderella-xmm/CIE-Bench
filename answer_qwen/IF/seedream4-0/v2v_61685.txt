    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image exhibit characteristics of a Swiss Design poster, such as clean lines, minimalism, and a focus on typography?",
    "explanation": "The edited image features clean, geometric lines and simplified forms, which are hallmarks of Swiss Design. The composition is uncluttered, with flat colors and minimal shading, emphasizing clarity and order—key principles of Swiss graphic design. The typography is bold, sans-serif, and centrally placed at the top, drawing attention to the message 'SKATE FOR ALL.' This prioritization of legible, impactful text over decorative elements aligns with the Swiss emphasis on typographic hierarchy and functional design. While not all aspects may be strictly adherent (e.g., some color variety), the overall aesthetic strongly reflects Swiss Design ideals.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the layout of the edited image strongly asymmetrical?",
    "explanation": "The layout of the edited image appears balanced rather than strongly asymmetrical. The central figures—the girl on the skateboard and the man beside her—are positioned near the center of the frame, creating a visual anchor. The background tent is centered behind them, and the sky and clouds extend symmetrically across the top. Although there are slight variations in figure placement (e.g., the boy on the far left), the overall composition maintains horizontal balance and symmetry, particularly in the distribution of negative space and structural elements like the railing and horizon line. Asymmetry would imply a deliberate imbalance in visual weight, which is not present here.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Have the human figures and the background tent been simplified into flat graphic shapes?",
    "explanation": "Yes, the human figures and the background tent in the edited image have been rendered in a highly stylized manner using flat, two-dimensional shapes. There are no gradients, shadows, or textures that suggest depth or realism; instead, solid colors define forms. For example, the man’s body is composed of simple geometric blocks (rectangular torso, cylindrical limbs), and the tent is a flat blue triangle with no folds or fabric detail. This simplification into flat graphics is consistent with modern illustrative styles often seen in posters and digital art, where realism is sacrificed for clarity and visual impact.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the colors in the edited image restricted to blues, whites, and the man's green shirt as an accent?",
    "explanation": "The color palette is primarily composed of blues (sky, tent), white (clouds, parts of clothing), and the green shirt of the man, which stands out as a strong accent. However, additional colors are present: the orange skateboards, purple wheels, black helmets and protective gear, and the striped dress of the girl (black and white). These add variation beyond the core blue-white-green scheme. While the dominant colors are indeed blue, white, and green, the inclusion of orange and purple indicates that the palette is not strictly limited to those three. Therefore, the restriction is partial but not complete.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the text 'SKATE FOR ALL' integrated in a bold, clean sans serif typeface across the upper cloudy sky region?",
    "explanation": "Yes, the text 'SKATE FOR ALL' is prominently displayed at the top of the image, superimposed over the sky and cloud area. It is rendered in a bold, clean sans-serif font, which is typical of modern graphic design and aligns with Swiss Design principles. The letters are evenly spaced and large enough to dominate the upper portion of the composition without obstructing key visual elements. The integration into the sky region uses negative space effectively, making the message both visible and harmonious within the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
