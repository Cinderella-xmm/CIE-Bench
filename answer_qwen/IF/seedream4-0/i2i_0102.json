      "question": "Is the word “Draft” written in a handwritten font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' is visible on the yellow sticky note. The letters exhibit irregular stroke thickness, varying curvature, and natural imperfections typical of handwriting, such as the slight tilt of the 'D' and the fluid connection between letters like 'r' and 'a'. These characteristics are inconsistent with printed or digital fonts, which usually have uniform strokes and precise alignment. Additionally, the presence of a pencil tip near the word suggests it was written by hand. Based on these visual cues and common knowledge about handwriting versus typed text, it is clear that the word is handwritten.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the word “Draft” placed on the yellow paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' is clearly positioned on the surface of the bright yellow sticky note. The text appears to be centered and occupies a significant portion of the paper's visible area. The yellow paper serves as the background for the text, and there is no indication that the word is superimposed digitally or placed elsewhere. This placement is consistent with typical usage of sticky notes for writing short messages or labels. Therefore, the word is indeed placed on the yellow paper.",

      "question": "Does the image resemble a design sketch cover focused on presenting the word “Draft”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a close-up of a blue pencil hovering over a yellow sticky note with the word 'Draft' written on it. While the composition emphasizes the word, it lacks elements typically associated with a design sketch cover—such as artistic layouts, decorative borders, multiple design elements, or branding. Instead, the scene resembles a real-world scenario of note-taking or drafting ideas, possibly in an office environment. The focus is functional rather than aesthetic. Therefore, despite the emphasis on the word 'Draft', the image does not resemble a formal design sketch cover.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the word “Draft” clearly visible and legible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' is written in black ink (or pencil lead) on a bright yellow background, creating strong contrast that enhances visibility. The letters are large enough and spaced appropriately to be easily read. Although the handwriting is cursive and slightly informal, each letter is distinguishable and follows standard English script conventions. There are no obstructions or blurring that would impair legibility. Based on visual clarity and contrast, the word is clearly visible and legible.",

      "question": "Are there any elements in the image other than the yellow paper and the word “Draft”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several elements are present beyond the yellow paper and the word 'Draft'. These include the blue pencil, which is positioned above the note and appears to be in the act of writing. In the background, part of a laptop keyboard is visible, indicating a desk or workspace setting. Additionally, the white surface beneath the yellow paper and the wooden desk surface in the far background contribute to the overall context. Therefore, the image contains multiple objects and environmental details beyond just the paper and the word.",
