    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image include the front, left side, and top views of both refrigerators?",
    "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) is a composite of multiple views of two refrigerators. By analyzing the visual layout, we can identify that the top portion shows two frontal views of the refrigerators side by side, while the bottom portion displays angled perspectives—one showing the left side of the refrigerator on the left, and the other showing the right side of the refrigerator on the right. However, there is no clear top-down view of either refrigerator. The top view would require an overhead perspective, which is not present in any of the panels. Therefore, although front and partial side views are included, the top view is missing. This conclusion is based on standard product photography conventions where distinct angles (front, side, top) are clearly differentiated. Since the top view is absent, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the refrigerators displayed in a way that allows viewers to see detailed features clearly, making the image appropriate for e-commerce or instructional purposes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the refrigerators are shown from multiple angles—frontal and angled side views—which allows visibility of key features such as the door handles, water dispensers, control panels, and overall design. These elements are critical for e-commerce or instructional content where clarity and detail matter. The lighting is consistent and bright, enhancing visibility without glare. The arrangement ensures that important functional components (e.g., dispenser, brand label, door alignment) are visible. Although it's a composite image, each segment is clear and focused on the appliance. From a user experience standpoint, this multi-angle presentation effectively showcases the product’s design and functionality, aligning with best practices in product visualization. Thus, the image is suitable for professional use.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Have the combined views maintained the original proportions and design details of the refrigerators without distortion?",
    "explanation": "To evaluate proportionality and distortion, we examine how the refrigerators appear across the different panels. In Image B, the refrigerators are consistently depicted with symmetrical doors, aligned handles, and properly scaled dispensers. There is no evident stretching, warping, or scaling mismatch between the panels. For example, the vertical alignment of the handles and the relative size of the dispensers remain consistent across all views. Additionally, the surrounding cabinetry and countertops maintain proportional relationships with the appliances, suggesting careful composition. While compositing can introduce distortions, here the transitions between views are seamless and geometrically coherent. This suggests that the editing process preserved the original design integrity. Hence, the proportions and details appear accurate and undistorted.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the image free of irrelevant or distracting elements, focusing solely on the refrigerators and their features?",
    "explanation": "The image includes kitchen elements such as cabinets, countertops, backsplash tiles, windows, and small decorative items (e.g., plants, bowls). While these elements provide context and realism, they are not strictly relevant to the refrigerator itself. However, in product marketing, contextual elements like cabinetry and lighting are often used to showcase integration into a real-world setting. These elements do not obscure the refrigerators and are kept minimal and clean. The focus remains on the appliances due to their central placement and prominent scale. That said, the presence of background details—though tasteful—adds some environmental context rather than being purely focused on the product. Still, since these elements support product visualization without overwhelming the viewer, they are not considered distracting. Therefore, the image maintains a balance between context and focus, making it acceptable for professional use despite minor contextual clutter.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the edited image maintain sufficient resolution and clarity to serve as a professional product display for e-commerce or installation manuals?",
    "explanation": "The image exhibits high resolution and sharpness across all panels. Details such as the texture of the stainless steel finish, the digital interface of the water dispenser, and the cabinet hardware are clearly visible. There is no pixelation, blurring, or compression artifacts, indicating a high-quality output. The lighting is even, minimizing shadows that could hide features. Given that the image is composed of multiple views but each segment retains clarity and fine detail, it meets the standards required for professional use in e-commerce or technical documentation. Such images must be legible at various zoom levels and convey precise design information, which this image does effectively. Therefore, the resolution and clarity are adequate for professional applications.",
    "answer": "Yes"
