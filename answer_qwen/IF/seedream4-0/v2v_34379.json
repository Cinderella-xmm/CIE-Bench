      "question": "Are the vegetables in the dish visibly smaller than they were in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables (broccoli and cauliflower) appear more compact and less voluminous compared to their appearance in Image A. This shrinkage is consistent with the natural reduction in volume that occurs when vegetables are roasted or cooked, as moisture is lost and cellular structures contract. The florets in Image B are noticeably denser and have a more shriveled texture, which indicates a reduction in size. Based on visual comparison and common knowledge about cooking effects on vegetables, it is clear that the vegetables have shrunk.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the space between the vegetables increased due to their shrinkage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the vegetables being smaller, they appear to be packed more tightly together, with less visible gaps between them. This suggests that the shrinkage has caused the vegetables to settle closer together rather than creating more space. In contrast, in Image A, the raw vegetables are larger and occupy more space, leaving more visible gaps between them. The lack of increased spacing in Image B contradicts the expectation of expanded gaps due to shrinkage, indicating that the reduction in size has not led to increased inter-vegetable space.",

      "question": "Do the vegetables maintain their original shapes and colors despite being smaller?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vegetables in Image B have undergone significant changes in color and texture. The raw broccoli and cauliflower in Image A are bright green and white, respectively, with fresh, crisp appearances. In Image B, the vegetables are browned and charred in places, indicating roasting. The shape of the florets is still recognizable but altered—some edges are curled or blackened. Therefore, while the general form is retained, the colors and textures have changed significantly due to cooking. Thus, the vegetables do not maintain their original shapes and colors.",

      "question": "Is the size of the dish holding the vegetables unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both dishes in Image A and Image B are identical in size, shape, and placement. They are rectangular ceramic baking dishes with handles, and their dimensions appear consistent across both images. There is no visual distortion or scaling difference between the two images that would suggest a change in dish size. The background wooden surface also provides a stable reference point, confirming that the dishes have not been resized. Therefore, based on visual consistency and spatial context, the dish size remains unchanged.",

      "question": "Have any new elements been added or existing elements removed besides shrinking the vegetables?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary change is the cooking of the vegetables, which results in browning, charring, and shrinkage. No new objects such as spices, oil, or seasonings are visibly added. The arrangement of the vegetables appears similar, though slightly more compact. However, there is a notable absence of some individual pieces—particularly in the left dish, where fewer distinct florets are visible, suggesting possible removal or merging of elements. Additionally, the right dish shows signs of residue or seasoning dust, which may indicate added elements like salt or spices. While the core transformation is shrinkage, subtle additions (like seasoning) and possible removals (fewer visible florets) suggest changes beyond mere size reduction. Therefore, yes, additional changes have occurred.",
