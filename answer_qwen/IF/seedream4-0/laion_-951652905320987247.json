      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible glass terrarium structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a landscape with snow-capped mountains, trees, and a lake, all contained within a transparent, spherical glass vessel. The curvature of the glass is evident from the distortion of the background and the way light reflects off its surface. The edges of the glass are clearly visible, especially at the top rim and base, confirming that this is a closed, artificial environment resembling a terrarium or globe. This type of structure is commonly used in dioramas to create miniature scenes. Based on visual cues such as the rounded shape, reflections, and containment of the scene, it is clear that the entire landscape is enclosed within a glass terrarium.",

      "question": "Are the snow-capped peaks made of visibly textured and glittering materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the mountain peaks in Image B, they exhibit a shimmering, reflective quality that suggests the use of glitter or a similar sparkly material. The texture appears granular and non-uniform, with bright specks scattered across the surface, which is inconsistent with natural snow but typical of artificial representations using glitter or metallic powder. Natural snow would appear more matte and uniformly white under sunlight. The glittery effect enhances the illusion of sparkle under direct light, indicating an intentional artistic choice to make the peaks visually striking. Therefore, the peaks are not realistic snow but rather constructed from textured, glittering materials.",

      "question": "Does the landscape feature intricately detailed, fine-brushed foliage instead of natural-looking vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in the scene are small, stylized, and uniformly shaped, suggesting they are model trees rather than real plants. Their branches are finely detailed but have a repetitive, manufactured appearance characteristic of artificial miniatures used in dioramas. The coloration and texture of the foliage—especially the layered, brush-like patterns—indicate that they were likely created using fine-brush techniques or molded plastic materials designed to mimic nature. These features differ significantly from natural vegetation, which would show more variation in size, shape, and texture. Thus, the foliage is not natural but crafted with intricate detailing, consistent with fine-brushed or sculpted miniature models.",

      "question": "Is the lake represented by a reflective, translucent resin-like surface with a synthetic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of water in the foreground has a smooth, glossy surface that reflects the surrounding elements with high clarity and sharpness. However, the reflection lacks the subtle distortions and ripples typical of natural water. Instead, it exhibits a uniform, almost mirror-like quality with a slight bluish tint and internal refraction effects that suggest it is made of a solid, transparent material like resin or acrylic. The way light interacts with the surface—producing highlights and a consistent sheen—further supports the conclusion that it is not real water but a synthetic, polished substance designed to simulate a lake. This is common in miniature dioramas where realism is balanced with durability and visual appeal.",

      "question": "Are there small, detailed chalet figurines placed along the shoreline of the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Along the edge of the lake in the diorama, several small structures are visible. These buildings resemble traditional alpine chalets, with sloped roofs covered in snow, wooden facades, and multiple windows. They are proportionally scaled to the rest of the scene and appear to be handcrafted or commercially produced miniature models. Their placement along the shore, combined with their architectural style and level of detail (such as individual doors and roof textures), confirms that they are figurines rather than real buildings. This is consistent with the overall theme of a miniature winter landscape displayed within a terrarium.",
