      "question": "Is there a collectible packaging box visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large, transparent plastic display box is clearly visible in the background. The box has a black base with printed branding and contains two figures inside. It is designed to resemble a retail collectible package, commonly used for action figures or transformable toys. The presence of clear plastic windows, branded text, and internal display elements indicates it is a collectible packaging box. This type of packaging is typical for premium toy releases, especially those marketed as 'collectibles' or 'limited editions'.",

      "question": "Is the packaging box rendered in an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging box in Image B is shown from a three-quarter angle that reveals its front, top, and side surfaces. This view allows visibility of depth and dimensionality, which is characteristic of an isometric or near-isometric perspective. In such views, the object appears angled to show multiple sides simultaneously without distortion, often used in product photography to highlight design details. The consistent angles and proportions suggest an intentional isometric rendering to showcase the product comprehensively.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the front lower portion of the packaging box in Image B, the text 'DUAL TRANSFORMER HEROES' is clearly printed in bold white letters with red outlines. The same text also appears on the top lid of the box. This branding is prominent and legible, indicating the name of the product line. The font style and placement are consistent with marketing materials for toy lines inspired by transformer themes.",

      "question": "Are chibi-style versions of the car and robot present inside the packaging box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the packaging box in Image B, two smaller figures are displayed. These figures are stylized with exaggerated proportions—larger heads, simplified features, and compact bodies—which are hallmarks of chibi art style. Both figures represent the robot form of the toy, with one standing upright and the other seated on a gear-like base. They are not full-scale models but scaled-down, cartoonish representations, consistent with chibi-style collectibles. The presence of two identical-looking figures suggests they are part of a dual-pack set.",

      "question": "Are the chibi figures inside the box rendered in vibrant metallic red and black colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figures inside the packaging box exhibit a glossy finish with dominant red and black coloration. The red parts, particularly on the arms and torso, have a reflective sheen suggesting a metallic or chrome-like material. Black sections appear matte but contrast sharply with the red, enhancing the visual impact. This color scheme matches the larger figures outside the box, reinforcing brand consistency. The use of metallic finishes is common in collectible toys to simulate high-tech or futuristic aesthetics.",

      "question": "Are the mini tool set, interchangeable helmets, and gear base visible inside the packaging box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the packaging box in Image B, several accessories are clearly visible. There are two helmet-like objects—one red and one black—placed in front of the chibi figures. Additionally, a set of small tools (resembling wrenches and screwdrivers) is arranged neatly nearby. A circular gear-shaped base is also present beneath one of the figures, serving as a display stand. These items are standard in premium toy sets and enhance playability and collectibility. Their inclusion confirms the presence of all mentioned accessories.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Outside the packaging box in Image B, there are two larger figures: one in the form of a sleek red-and-black sports car, and another in a robot configuration. These figures are significantly larger than the chibi versions inside the box and appear to be the main transformable toy model. The car and robot are positioned prominently in the foreground, indicating they are the primary focus of the display. This setup suggests that the full-sized versions are included in the set and are being showcased separately for visual appeal.",

      "question": "Do the figures outside the box exhibit realistic textures and lifelike appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The full-sized car and robot figures outside the box in Image B have smooth, glossy surfaces with sharp reflections, indicating a high-quality plastic finish. While they are stylized and fictional, their design incorporates realistic automotive details (e.g., headlights, wheels, grille) and mechanical articulation. However, they do not possess lifelike human features or organic textures; instead, they maintain a robotic, toy-like aesthetic. The term 'lifelike' typically refers to biological realism, which these figures lack. Therefore, while detailed, they are not lifelike in the true sense.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in Image B are displayed on a clean, white surface that reflects light and shows faint reflections of the toys. The lighting is even and bright, with no harsh shadows, suggesting studio-grade illumination. The overall setting is minimalistic and pristine, typical of product photography aimed at highlighting details. The reflective floor enhances the visual appeal, creating a polished, showroom-like atmosphere. This environment is designed to emphasize the product’s design and quality, consistent with professional commercial photography.",
