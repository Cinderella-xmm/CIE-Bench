      "question": "Is the character presented in a 3D cartoon aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is rendered with smooth, rounded features, exaggerated proportions (such as large eyes and simplified facial structure), and a stylized appearance typical of 3D animated or cartoon characters. The lighting and shading suggest depth and volume consistent with 3D modeling techniques, and the overall look lacks photorealism, aligning with a cartoon aesthetic. These visual cues—combined with world knowledge that 3D cartoons often feature such characteristics—support the conclusion that the character is indeed presented in a 3D cartoon style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of Image B, there is a panel labeled 'Skillu ine Name' (likely a stylized or humorous typo for 'Skill Name'), which contains three horizontal bars. Each bar corresponds to a skill: 'Creativity +10', 'Problem-Solving +12', and 'Party-Planning +8'. These are visually represented as progress bars with color-coded fills and numerical values, matching the format of skill indicators commonly seen in video games or collectible cards. Based on this direct visual evidence, the skills are clearly present and formatted as described.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, there is a decorative banner with a blue ribbon design and the text 'Birthday Engineer' prominently displayed in a bold, serif font. This banner is centered above the character and matches the description exactly. The use of a banner with a celebratory theme aligns with common design practices for themed collectible cards or digital avatars, reinforcing the likelihood that this is an intentional title element.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B includes multiple colorful balloons (pink, red, yellow, teal) floating in the air, along with stringed triangular party flags. Additionally, lit candles are visible on tables in the background, contributing to a party atmosphere. These elements—balloons, decorations, and candles—are classic indicators of a festive setting, particularly a birthday celebration. The combination of these visual cues confirms a festive-themed backdrop.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B consists of warm tones such as yellows, oranges, pinks, and soft browns, which evoke a joyful and inviting mood. The lighting appears diffused and evenly distributed, avoiding harsh shadows and creating a soft, glowing effect that enhances the celebratory feel. These characteristics—warm hues and gentle illumination—are consistent with the design choices used in cheerful, family-friendly media. Therefore, the image does utilize warm, cheerful colors and soft lighting.",
