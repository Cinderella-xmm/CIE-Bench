      "question": "Are the brush stroke patterns on the baseball bats consistent with the traditional Japanese Ukiyo-e style while preserving their original shape?",

      "question": "Does the grass texture depict a Ukiyo-e style with natural brush strokes and without any unnatural or disjointed patches?",

      "question": "Do the proportions and positions of the baseball bats relative to the grass maintain visual credibility and authenticity in the Ukiyo-e style?",
