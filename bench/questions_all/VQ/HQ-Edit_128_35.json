    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the typewriter into a notebook cover while maintaining structural consistency, evaluate whether the overall shape of the typewriter retains its recognizable form without collapsing or distorting key components such as the keyboard, carriage, or paper roller. The transformation must preserve geometric integrity to ensure visual credibility.",
      "question": "Is the typewriter’s keyboard area preserved with correct key layout and spacing, and does the body maintain a coherent rectangular form without warped edges or missing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating the retro font \"Tales Untold\" across the top half of the notebook cover, assess whether the text is properly aligned and sized relative to the typewriter’s dimensions. It should not overlap critical mechanical parts like the typebars or paper roller, and its style should harmonize with the vintage theme.",
      "question": "Is the text \"Tales Untold\" positioned above the keyboard area without covering any functional parts of the typewriter, and does it follow a horizontal baseline consistent with the notebook’s orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding faded ink splatters and parchment textures, evaluate whether these surface effects are applied organically across the notebook cover. They should not repeat in a grid-like pattern or create sharp boundaries, and their opacity should allow underlying details to remain visible.",
      "question": "Are the ink splatters scattered irregularly across the surface, with varying sizes and soft edges, and do they not obscure important structural elements like the keys or paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the wooden table with a marbled background, assess whether the new background extends consistently beneath the notebook cover and aligns with the lighting direction from the original image. There should be no visible seam where the notebook meets the background, and the marbling should appear continuous.",
      "question": "Does the marbled background continue evenly under the entire base of the notebook cover, with no visible gaps, clipping, or abrupt color shifts at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a leather spine with embossed typewriter key icons, evaluate whether the spine has a natural leather texture with subtle variations in tone and grain. The embossed keys should appear raised with proper shadowing and proportional sizing relative to the real keys on the typewriter.",
      "question": "Does the leather spine show a consistent texture with slight color variation, and are the embossed key icons evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and shaded to suggest depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
