Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction requires transforming the building facade into an organic, alien-like structure by altering its architectural elements. The original image features a modern, curvilinear high-rise with smooth metallic surfaces, glass windows, and flowing balconies. These elements must be reimagined to resemble biological forms—specifically tentacle-like appendages, fibrous textures, translucent membrane panels, iridescent scale patterns, and bioluminescent lines. Each transformation targets specific visual components of the facade: the curved metal sections (to become tentacles), window surfaces (replaced with membranes), material texture (metal to scales), and edge lighting (added glow). These changes affect realism, material coherence, structural logic, and detail fidelity. Therefore, sub-requirements must evaluate whether each modification preserves visual plausibility without introducing artifacts or distortions.

-Sub requirement 1: Transforming the curved metallic sections into tentacle-like appendages—evaluate whether the new shape maintains structural continuity and avoids unnatural bending or stretching that breaks geometric coherence.
-Sub requirement 2: Adding fibrous textures across sections—assess if the texture appears natural and consistent with organic matter, without pixelation or artificial repetition.
-Sub requirement 3: Replacing window surfaces with translucent, membrane-like panels—check if the replacement maintains transparency and surface integrity, avoiding visible seams or distortion of underlying content.
-Sub requirement 4: Detailing the metal with iridescent, scale-like patterning—verify that the pattern follows the curvature of the surface and does not appear flat, misaligned, or overly stylized.
-Sub requirement 5: Incorporating bio-luminescent lines along edges that emit eerie glow—determine if the glow is softly diffused and physically plausible, without harsh halos or inconsistent brightness.
-Sub requirement 6: Ensuring overall structural coherence—confirm that all modified parts remain connected logically and do not introduce floating or disconnected elements.
-Sub requirement 7: Preserving fine details such as balcony railings, reflections, and shadows—ensure these are not lost or distorted during edits.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the curved metallic sections into tentacle-like appendages, this involves reshaping the existing flowing balconies and walls. The key concern is whether the new form retains physical plausibility—such as maintaining continuous curvature and avoiding abrupt kinks or impossible bends that break the original architectural flow. The edit should not result in disjointed segments or unnatural bulges that contradict the building’s original volumetric structure.
Question: Are the tentacle-like extensions smoothly integrated into the original curves of the facade without sudden angular breaks or disconnected segments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding fibrous textures across sections, this applies to the metallic surfaces between windows and along the undulating planes. Fibrous textures should mimic natural organic materials like muscle or plant fibers. If the texture appears repetitive, aliased, or unnaturally aligned with grid patterns, it undermines authenticity. The texture must follow the surface contour and avoid sharp edges or blocky patches.
Question: Do the fibrous textures follow the curvature of the facade and appear continuous without repeating patterns or jagged edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing window surfaces with translucent, membrane-like panels, this affects the glass areas where reflections and interior views are visible. The new membrane should allow partial visibility while appearing thin and flexible, like biological tissue. If the replacement introduces hard edges, opacity mismatches, or ghosting around the frame, it suggests poor integration. The transition from original glass to membrane should be seamless.
Question: Are the window areas replaced with translucent membranes that maintain soft light transmission and lack sharp borders or visible seams?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of applying iridescent, scale-like patterning to the metal, this involves overlaying a detailed texture over the reflective surface. The scales must conform to the complex curves of the facade and reflect light naturally. If the scales appear flat, misaligned, or have unnatural color gradients, it indicates a loss of depth and realism. The pattern should not obscure the underlying architecture or create visual noise.
Question: Do the iridescent scale patterns align with the surface curvature and display smooth color transitions without flat or distorted regions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of incorporating bio-luminescent lines along edges, this refers to glowing outlines along the balcony edges and structural ridges. The glow should be subtle and diffuse, resembling bioluminescence rather than neon or digital effects. Harsh glows, uniform brightness, or halo artifacts suggest artificiality. The light must interact with surrounding surfaces, casting faint shadows or reflections.
Question: Do the bio-luminescent lines emit a soft, uneven glow that fades naturally at the edges and interacts with nearby surfaces?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of ensuring structural coherence, this evaluates whether all transformed elements remain connected and proportionate. For example, tentacle extensions should not float away from the main body, and membrane windows should not detach from their frames. Any element that appears detached, oversized, or misaligned compromises visual credibility.
Question: Are all modified elements—tentacles, membranes, textures, and glow lines—properly anchored to the building structure without floating or overlapping incorrectly?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q7: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving fine details, this checks whether secondary elements like balcony railings, planters, and interior furnishings remain visible and intact after editing. If these details are erased, blurred, or distorted due to texture overlays, it reduces perceptual quality. The presence of small objects like potted plants or furniture helps ground the scene in reality.
Question: Are balcony railings, interior furniture, and planters still visible and undistorted beneath the added textures and lighting effects?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
