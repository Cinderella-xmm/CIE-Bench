      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the owl's feathers with iridescent emerald and gold patterns, evaluate whether the new coloration maintains the natural layering and directionality of real feathers. The original owl has intricate brown and white mottling; any iridescent effect must respect this underlying structure to avoid appearing painted or flat.",
      "question": "Do the iridescent emerald and gold feather patterns follow the natural feather alignment and texture of the owl’s body, without creating blocky or unnatural color transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the wings with ethereal, mist-like extensions, assess whether the mist conforms to the original wing shape and attaches seamlessly to the body. Mist should not float independently or create gaps where wings were.",
      "question": "Are the mist-like wing extensions connected smoothly to the owl’s body and shaped in accordance with the original wing outline, without floating or detached segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding rune-like markings across the body, evaluate whether the runes are embedded within the feather texture rather than appearing as flat overlays. They should follow the curvature and density of feathers without breaking their continuity.",
      "question": "Are the rune-like markings integrated into the feather pattern such that they follow the natural contours of the owl’s body and do not disrupt the texture or appear as separate graphic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of turning the eyes into luminous orbs reflecting the moon, assess whether the eye shape remains consistent with the original round, yellow-eyed structure, and whether the glow appears soft and diffused rather than harsh or artificial.",
      "question": "Do the eyes retain their original oval shape and pupil structure while displaying a soft, glowing light with visible moon-like reflections, without excessive brightness or halo artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adorning the talons with vines and glowing gems, evaluate whether the vines wrap around the claws in a physically plausible manner and whether the gems are positioned without overlapping or floating unnaturally.",
      "question": "Are the vines wrapped naturally around the owl’s talons, with gems placed at logical junctions along the vines and no clipping or misalignment with the claws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency, assess whether all modified elements (feathers, wings, runes, eyes, talons) remain proportionally aligned with the owl’s original size and posture, and whether the overall composition retains visual balance.",
      "question": "Does the entire owl, including its transformed features, maintain proportional alignment with the original body structure and perch, without elongation, compression, or misplacement of limbs?",

        "Yes",
