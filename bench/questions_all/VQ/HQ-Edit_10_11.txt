Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction requires transforming the gorilla into a wood-carved sculpture using varying shades of brown to define body contours. This involves a complete material transformation from fur-covered primate to carved wood, which significantly affects perceived realism and natural appearance. The original image shows a highly detailed, realistic gorilla with natural fur texture, anatomical accuracy, and lifelike skin tones. The transformation must preserve the gorilla’s structural form while replacing its material properties with wood. Therefore, sub-requirements include evaluating whether the new material (wood) appears consistent in texture and shading across the entire body, whether the transition from original anatomy to sculpted form maintains geometric integrity, and whether any artifacts such as unnatural edges or inconsistent grain patterns are introduced.
-Sub requirement 1: Transform the gorilla’s body into a wood-carved sculpture using brown tones—evaluate whether the material change preserves structural coherence and avoids unnatural textures or color inconsistencies.
-Sub requirement 2: Engrave detailed fur textures into the wooden surface—assess whether the engraved details resemble real wood grain and maintain visual plausibility without appearing artificial or over-rendered.
-Sub requirement 3: Smooth out the arms and legs—check if smoothing operations distort anatomical proportions or introduce unnatural curvature that breaks physical logic.
-Sub requirement 4: Replace the leafy backdrop with an etched wooden surface featuring scattered leaves in darker wood tones—determine whether the background transformation retains compositional balance and spatial depth without introducing dissonance between foreground and background.
-Sub requirement 5: Ensure the overall composition reflects forest essence without distraction—evaluate whether the simplified background still conveys environmental context naturally and does not appear flat or disconnected from the main subject.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the gorilla’s body into a wood-carved sculpture using brown tones, this question evaluates whether the material substitution maintains visual credibility by preserving consistent wood-like shading and texture across the entire body. The original gorilla has distinct areas of dark fur, silver back, and facial features; these must now be represented through variations in wood tone and carving depth. Any abrupt shifts in color or lack of continuity in grain direction would compromise authenticity.
Question: Does the entire body of the gorilla exhibit consistent wood texture and shading, with no sudden color changes or patches that appear non-wood-like?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement to engrave detailed fur textures into the wooden surface, this question checks whether the fine lines and patterns mimic realistic wood grain or instead resemble artificial engravings. The original image has dense, layered fur, so the engraved version should simulate similar complexity but in relief form. If the texture looks overly uniform or lacks variation, it may appear unnatural.
Question: Are the engraved fur patterns on the gorilla's body varied in depth and direction, resembling natural wood grain rather than repetitive or synthetic lines?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement to smooth out the arms and legs, this question assesses whether the smoothing operation distorts the underlying anatomy. In the original image, the limbs have defined musculature and joint articulation. Excessive smoothing could flatten joints or eliminate natural bulges, leading to unnatural shapes. The evaluation focuses on whether the limb geometry remains plausible under the new material.
Question: Do the arms and legs retain anatomically correct proportions and joint structures, with no flattened or unnaturally curved sections due to excessive smoothing?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement to replace the leafy backdrop with an etched wooden surface featuring scattered leaves in darker wood tones, this question evaluates whether the background transformation maintains spatial coherence. The original background is a dense jungle with depth, light filtering, and layered foliage. The edited version must convey similar depth through etched lines and tonal contrast, without appearing flat or disconnected from the foreground subject.
Question: Is the background composed of etched wood patterns with darker leaf shapes integrated into it, maintaining depth and layering without appearing flat or disjointed from the gorilla?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement to capture the forest essence without distraction, this question evaluates whether the scattered leaves in the background are rendered in darker wood tones and positioned realistically. They should not float unnaturally or clash with the overall wooden theme. Their placement and shadowing should suggest natural fall or attachment to the surface.
Question: Are the scattered leaves in the background rendered in darker wood tones and placed in positions that suggest natural resting or embedding into the wooden surface, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
