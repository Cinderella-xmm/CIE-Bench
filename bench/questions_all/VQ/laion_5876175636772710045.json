      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the man’s modern attire with a brocade doublet and tights, this question evaluates whether the new clothing maintains realistic fabric texture and proper drape over his body. The focus is on the upper torso and legs, where the doublet should show appropriate stitching, sheen, and form-fitting structure, while the tights should follow leg contours without unnatural bulges or gaps.",
      "question": "Does the brocade doublet on the man have consistent texture, visible pattern details, and natural fabric folds that conform to his body shape without distortion?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the woman’s modern dress with a Renaissance-style gown, this question checks whether the new gown's material and construction appear plausible, particularly in the skirt area where layered fabric and ruffles are expected. The flow of the skirt during motion should reflect physical behavior of cloth, and any jeweled accents should be evenly distributed and not pixelated or misaligned.",
      "question": "Is the flowing skirt of the woman’s gown composed of layered, translucent fabric with natural ruffles and soft gradients, and do the jeweled accents appear embedded rather than pasted on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the modern stage with a grand Renaissance ballroom, this question assesses the realism of the background elements—specifically the marble floor and chandeliers. The marble should show natural veining and reflective properties, and the chandeliers should have symmetrical structure and light emission consistent with real glass and metal materials.",
      "question": "Do the marble floor tiles display continuous veining patterns and subtle reflections, and are the chandeliers structurally sound with clear crystal elements and warm light diffusion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering the entire scene in the style of traditional Renaissance art, this question examines whether the lighting and shadows align with classical techniques—soft transitions, directional highlights, and volumetric depth—without digital artifacts like harsh edges or unnatural contrast.",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the dancers soft and directional, consistent with overhead chandeliers, and do they blend smoothly into the surrounding environment without sharp boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining anatomical accuracy and structural consistency, this question focuses on the hands and arms of both dancers, especially where they are in contact. The number of fingers should be five per hand, joints should align naturally, and skin texture should be uniform without stretching or clipping.",
      "question": "Do both dancers' hands show five fingers each with natural joint alignment, smooth skin texture, and no overlapping or missing digits at the point of contact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
