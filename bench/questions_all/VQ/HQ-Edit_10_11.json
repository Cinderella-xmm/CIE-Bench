      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the gorillaâ€™s body into a wood-carved sculpture using brown tones, this question evaluates whether the material substitution maintains visual credibility by preserving consistent wood-like shading and texture across the entire body. The original gorilla has distinct areas of dark fur, silver back, and facial features; these must now be represented through variations in wood tone and carving depth. Any abrupt shifts in color or lack of continuity in grain direction would compromise authenticity.",
      "question": "Does the entire body of the gorilla exhibit consistent wood texture and shading, with no sudden color changes or patches that appear non-wood-like?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "According to the sub requirement to engrave detailed fur textures into the wooden surface, this question checks whether the fine lines and patterns mimic realistic wood grain or instead resemble artificial engravings. The original image has dense, layered fur, so the engraved version should simulate similar complexity but in relief form. If the texture looks overly uniform or lacks variation, it may appear unnatural.",
      "question": "Are the engraved fur patterns on the gorilla's body varied in depth and direction, resembling natural wood grain rather than repetitive or synthetic lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to smooth out the arms and legs, this question assesses whether the smoothing operation distorts the underlying anatomy. In the original image, the limbs have defined musculature and joint articulation. Excessive smoothing could flatten joints or eliminate natural bulges, leading to unnatural shapes. The evaluation focuses on whether the limb geometry remains plausible under the new material.",
      "question": "Do the arms and legs retain anatomically correct proportions and joint structures, with no flattened or unnaturally curved sections due to excessive smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to replace the leafy backdrop with an etched wooden surface featuring scattered leaves in darker wood tones, this question evaluates whether the background transformation maintains spatial coherence. The original background is a dense jungle with depth, light filtering, and layered foliage. The edited version must convey similar depth through etched lines and tonal contrast, without appearing flat or disconnected from the foreground subject.",
      "question": "Is the background composed of etched wood patterns with darker leaf shapes integrated into it, maintaining depth and layering without appearing flat or disjointed from the gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to capture the forest essence without distraction, this question evaluates whether the scattered leaves in the background are rendered in darker wood tones and positioned realistically. They should not float unnaturally or clash with the overall wooden theme. Their placement and shadowing should suggest natural fall or attachment to the surface.",
      "question": "Are the scattered leaves in the background rendered in darker wood tones and placed in positions that suggest natural resting or embedding into the wooden surface, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
