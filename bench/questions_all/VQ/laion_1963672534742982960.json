      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of retaining the long hair and muscled neckline as part of a chibi-style warrior, this question evaluates whether the scaled-down version of the hair and neck maintains natural proportions and structural continuity. Specifically, it checks if the hair flows naturally from the head and whether the muscled neckline is simplified but still anatomically plausible in the chibi form.",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style warrior retain the long hair and muscled neckline with proportional scaling and without unnatural deformation?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding translucent icy armor, this question assesses whether the armor appears physically plausible with proper transparency, refraction, and edge definition. It checks for artifacts such as solid black outlines, incorrect lighting, or clipping where the armor overlaps the body.",
      "question": "Is the icy armor transparent with visible internal reflections and no solid or jagged edges that suggest digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding miniature ice shards encircling the figure, this question examines whether the shards are appropriately sized relative to the figure and terrain, and whether they exhibit natural ice-like textures and placement. It checks for symmetry, alignment, and integration into the scene.",
      "question": "Are the ice shards evenly distributed around the figure, small enough to fit the snow globe scale, and textured like real ice without repeating patterns or floating anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the figure on a snowy, jagged terrain pedestal, this question evaluates whether the terrain has a natural snow-and-rock texture, correct depth, and proper grounding of the figure. It checks for floating elements, unnatural angles, or texture repetition.",
      "question": "Is the terrain beneath the figure composed of jagged, snow-covered rocks with realistic texture and shadowing, and does the figure rest securely on it without appearing suspended?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a wooden base with carved runes, this question checks whether the base has realistic wood grain, appropriate thickness, and legible runes that appear hand-carved. It evaluates material authenticity and integration with the overall scene.",
      "question": "Does the wooden base have consistent wood texture, visible grain, and clearly defined runes that do not appear pixelated or digitally overlaid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enclosing the scene within a snow globe, this question assesses whether the spherical boundary is smooth, transparent, and correctly refracts the internal elements. It checks for visible seams, distortion, or incorrect light behavior.",
      "question": "Is the snow globe's surface smooth and transparent, with no visible seams or distortions that affect the internal elements' appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining visual consistency between the original facial features and their chibi representation, this question checks whether the simplified face retains key traits (e.g., eye color, hair, wrinkles) in a way that matches the original figure’s identity without becoming unrecognizable.",
      "question": "Does the chibi version of the figure’s face preserve the original’s blue eyes, white hair, and facial structure in a simplified but identifiable manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
