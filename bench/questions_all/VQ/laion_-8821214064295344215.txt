Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the teddy bears into mosaic figurines using small colorful tiles to mimic fur texture, this involves replacing the original knitted texture with a tiled pattern. The evaluation focuses on whether the new tile-based fur texture appears consistent and natural across both bears, particularly in areas like the head, limbs, and body, without introducing unnatural textures or visible seams between tiles.
Question: Are the mosaic tiles uniformly distributed across the entire surface of both teddy bears, maintaining consistent size and alignment without visible gaps or misaligned edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: The instruction specifies replacing the knitted sweaters with intricate tile patterns in yellow and turquoise hues. This transformation must preserve the shape and fit of the sweaters while converting their material appearance. The evaluation checks whether the tile pattern accurately follows the contours of the sweater and maintains structural coherence without distorting the garmentâ€™s form.
Question: Do the yellow and turquoise tile patterns on the sweaters follow the original shape and contours of the garments without warping or breaking geometric shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: The facial features are to be recreated using subtly shaded tiles for detail. This requires preserving the structure of eyes, nose, mouth, and snout while adapting them to a mosaic style. The evaluation checks whether the facial features remain recognizable and proportionally accurate after conversion, avoiding distortions such as uneven shading or misplaced elements.
Question: Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) clearly defined and proportionally correct using shaded tiles, without blurring or misalignment that compromises recognition?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The bows are to be made from glossy, smooth tiles to contrast with the textured fur. This involves changing the material appearance of the bows while keeping their shape intact. The evaluation checks whether the glossy finish is applied consistently and realistically, without unnatural reflections or texture mismatches.
Question: Do the bows retain their original shape and appear with a smooth, reflective surface that contrasts naturally with the surrounding mosaic fur?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The bears are to be positioned on a minimalistic white pedestal to highlight artistic craftsmanship. This involves adding a new background element (the pedestal) and removing or modifying the original wooden surface. The evaluation checks whether the pedestal is seamlessly integrated, visually plausible, and does not introduce floating or clipping artifacts.
Question: Is the white pedestal fully grounded beneath the bears, with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does it maintain clean edges and uniform color without blending issues?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
