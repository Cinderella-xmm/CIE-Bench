      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of extending the zebra's stripes to blend with the grass while maintaining a natural appearance, we must evaluate if the transition between the zebra's stripes and the grass looks plausible and avoids introducing unnatural textures. This involves assessing the visual consistency and integration of the stripes with the environment.",
      "question": "Do the extended stripes seamlessly blend into the grass without creating unnatural textures or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Considering the requirement to maintain a surreal yet structurally coherent image, it is important to examine if the extension of the stripes respects the original proportions and geometric consistency of the zebra's body. This involves ensuring that the stripes do not distort or break the natural lines of the animal.",
      "question": "Are the stripes extended in a way that preserves the original geometric structure and proportions of the zebra's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "To evaluate the authenticity of the edited image, it is necessary to assess whether the visual composition holds together logically. This means checking that the surreal extension of the stripes into the grass does not disrupt the overall scene, keeping the zebra centered and maintaining visual plausibility.",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a visually credible composition where the zebra remains the focal point without being overshadowed by the surreal extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Given the need to preserve the zebraâ€™s core elements while creating a surreal effect, the focus should be on determining if the zebra still appears recognizable and authentic despite the artistic alterations. This involves ensuring that essential features like the mane, ears, and legs remain intact and natural looking.",
      "question": "Are key features of the zebra such as its mane, ears, and legs still clearly visible and natural looking amidst the surreal extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "As per the requirement of avoiding degradation of fine details during the extension of stripes, it's crucial to check if the texture and detail of both the zebra and the grassland remain well-preserved. This means ensuring that the editing process does not result in a loss of clarity or introduce distracting artifacts.",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the zebra's stripes and the grass been preserved without noticeable degradation or introduction of artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
