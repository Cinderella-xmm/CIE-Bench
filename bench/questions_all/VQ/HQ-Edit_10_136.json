      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"cartoonize the girl gently playing the guitar with an enlarged strumming hand\", evaluate whether the cartoonization effect applied to the girl maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility, particularly focusing on the hand that has been enlarged. The editing targets the girl’s figure, especially her right hand (strumming hand), which must retain anatomical correctness despite enlargement. This involves checking for distortions in finger count, unnatural proportions, or broken geometric shapes.",
      "question": "Does the enlarged strumming hand have five fingers with natural joint alignment and ergonomic shape, without any extra digits or unnatural bending?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"cartoonize the girl gently playing the guitar\", assess whether the stylized rendering of the girl’s facial features, clothing, and body maintains a consistent level of realism within the cartoon style, avoiding abrupt transitions or texture mismatches. The focus is on whether the cartoon effect blends naturally with the original image elements such as skin tone, hair texture, and fabric details.",
      "question": "Are the edges of the girl’s face, hair, and clothing smoothly integrated into the cartoon style without jagged lines, pixelation, or inconsistent shading?",

The editing position is the collage of posters on the back wall, specifically the areas where new logos are overlaid.",
      "question": "Do the watercolor band logos on the wall have soft brushstroke textures and natural color gradients without sharp digital edges or unnatural color bleeding?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"add a whimsical cat silhouette in pastel on the bed\", assess whether the cat silhouette is placed in a physically plausible location on the bed (e.g., not floating or intersecting with other objects) and whether its pastel color blends naturally with the bedding. The editing position is the bed surface, where the silhouette should appear as a soft overlay without distorting the underlying fabric texture.",
      "question": "Is the cat silhouette positioned on the bed without overlapping the edge of the blanket or pillow, and does it have smooth, non-jagged edges with a uniform pastel fill?",

The editing position is the white round stool next to the bed, where the box is added.",
      "question": "Is the writing box proportionally sized relative to the stool, and does it cast a subtle shadow consistent with the room's lighting direction without appearing floating or detached?",
