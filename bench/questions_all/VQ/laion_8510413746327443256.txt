Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the watch face into a radiant, holographic dragon eye, this involves replacing the original analog-digital hybrid display with a new complex visual element. The editing position is the entire screen area (the black-bordered rectangular display). This transformation affects the core functionality and appearance of the smartwatch, requiring that the new dragon eye maintains structural coherence with the surrounding frame and bezel, avoids unnatural textures or distortions in the light effects, and preserves fine details such as reflections and gradients to ensure perceptual realism.
Question: Does the holographic dragon eye on the watch face exhibit smooth gradients and consistent lighting without pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural glow artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of reimagining the band as segmented silver scales, this involves altering the material and texture of the original soft pink silicone band. The editing position is the entire band structure, including its curvature, connection points, and adjustment holes. The transformation must preserve the physical shape and flexibility of the band while introducing metallic segmentation that appears plausible in terms of scale alignment, surface reflectivity, and shadowing under ambient light.
Question: Are the silver scales on the band evenly aligned, properly shaded, and free from gaps or overlapping segments that break geometric continuity?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of changing the digital crown into a glowing neural node, this involves modifying the right-side circular button of the watch case. The original component is a rose gold-colored rotating crown with a red ring. The edit replaces it with a glowing, possibly translucent or illuminated structure. This change must maintain proportionality with the casing and avoid warping or misalignment with the adjacent side button. It must also feature coherent light emission without haloing or color bleeding into nearby areas.
Question: Is the glowing neural node on the side of the watch case properly integrated with the casing, showing consistent illumination and no unnatural light leakage or distortion in shape?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of enhancing the screen icons into luminescent control sigils, this involves replacing the existing app icons (music, activity rings, noise level) with stylized magical-tech symbols. These are located within the central region of the watch face. The transformation must preserve their relative positions and sizes while ensuring that the new sigils have consistent brightness, edge definition, and depth perception. They should not appear floating unnaturally or blur into the background.
Question: Do the luminescent control sigils on the watch face maintain clear boundaries and consistent brightness levels without blurring or ghosting around their edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency across the entire device, particularly when combining organic (dragon-like) and mechanical (smartwatch) elements, the overall composition must remain physically plausible. The edited watch must retain the correct proportions between the case, band, and buttons. The transition from the metallic case to the scaled band should be seamless, and the placement of components like the digital crown and side button should remain anatomically aligned with the original design.
Question: Are all components of the watch—case, band, crown, and side button—proportionally aligned and structurally coherent without visible warping, stretching, or misplacement?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
