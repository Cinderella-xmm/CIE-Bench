      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the mannequin into an ancient Indian stone sculpture, evaluate whether the material transformation from metallic mannequin to weathered stone maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows a smooth, reflective metallic surface; the edited version must replace this with a textured, aged stone appearance without introducing unnatural transitions or artifacts.",
      "question": "Does the surface of the mannequin's body exhibit a consistent weathered stone texture throughout, without patches of remaining metallic sheen or abrupt material changes?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of carving delicate floral and paisley motifs into the stone to reflect the embroidery of the saree, assess whether the intricate patterns are accurately transferred from fabric to stone in a way that preserves fine detail and avoids distortion. The original saree has dense, symmetrical floral and paisley designs along the border and pallu, which must be replicated as carved reliefs.",
      "question": "Are the floral and paisley patterns on the saree clearly visible as raised carvings on the stone surface, maintaining their original shape, symmetry, and spatial arrangement without blurring or geometric deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of depicting the mannequin in a stylized, serene pose typical of classical Indian sculptures, evaluate whether the posture is anatomically plausible and stylistically consistent with traditional Indian sculptural forms. The original mannequin stands upright with one hand resting on the hip; the edited version should adopt a more balanced, meditative stance common in temple art.",
      "question": "Is the mannequin’s pose proportionally correct and structurally stable, with limbs positioned in a way that aligns with classical Indian sculpture conventions (e.g., slight tilt of head, bent elbow, relaxed hand placement) without unnatural bending or floating limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the regal jewelry as ornate carved details, assess whether the necklace and bangle have been transformed into stone carvings while preserving their original design complexity and spatial relationship to the body. The original jewelry features layered gold chains and gem-like elements; these must now appear as detailed relief work in stone.",
      "question": "Are the necklace and bangle rendered as three-dimensional stone carvings with defined edges and depth, matching their original positions and proportions, and free from ghosting or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring the stone maintains a weathered, historical texture across all surfaces, evaluate whether the entire figure—including the saree folds, drapery lines, and facial features—shows consistent aging effects such as erosion, surface cracks, and patina. The original image has sharp, clean lines; the edited version must introduce natural degradation without compromising structural integrity.",
      "question": "Do the folds of the saree and contours of the body show subtle signs of weathering such as surface pitting, uneven texture, and shadowed crevices, without distorting the overall shape or creating artificial highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
