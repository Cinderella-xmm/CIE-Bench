Specifically, it checks for exaggerated but coherent musculature, absence of anatomical distortions (e.g., limbs too long or bent unnaturally), and whether the head-to-body ratio is plausible within the cartoon style. The original image has a large, muscular build with defined anatomy; the edit should preserve this scale but simplify it.",

It checks for the absence of glossy highlights, texture mismatches, or patches where the original skin texture still appears visible. The original image has a wet, organic texture; the edit must replace it with a flat, smooth surface.",

It checks whether the club is proportionally larger than the original spear, has soft edges and a porous texture indicative of foam, and is held in a natural pose by the ogre’s hand. The original spear is metallic and sharp; the new club must contrast in material and shape without appearing misaligned or deformed.",
