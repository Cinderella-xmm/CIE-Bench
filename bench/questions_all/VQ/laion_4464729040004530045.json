      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the newspaper-print dress with a high-neck, lace-trimmed bodice and voluminous floral skirt, evaluate whether the new dress maintains realistic fabric behavior, including natural folds and draping, particularly around the waist and hips where volume increases. The goal is to ensure structural coherence and visual plausibility without geometric distortions or unnatural textures.",
      "question": "Does the bodice and skirt exhibit natural fabric folds and draping consistent with the weight and volume of Victorian-era garments, especially at the waist and hip regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring the floral pattern on the skirt appears consistent in scale, orientation, and color saturation, assess whether the pattern repeats naturally or shows signs of artificial tiling, blurring, or inconsistent coloring. This evaluates the perceived quality of texture rendering.",
      "question": "Is the floral pattern on the skirt evenly distributed without visible repetition, pixelation, or color shifts that suggest digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding lace gloves to the hands and forearms, check whether the gloves conform to the natural shape of the hand, including correct finger count, joint angles, and skin-to-glove interface. This ensures anatomical accuracy and avoids deformations.",
      "question": "Do the lace gloves fit the hands naturally, showing five fingers per hand with correct joint alignment and no stretching or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the background with a Victorian garden, assess whether the new environment integrates seamlessly with the subject, maintaining consistent lighting, perspective, and depth. This checks for visual credibility and absence of clipping or edge artifacts.",
      "question": "Are the edges of the subject cleanly blended into the new garden background without visible seams, ghosting, or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the modern choker and earrings with a pearl choker and dainty earrings, evaluate whether the new jewelry appears physically plausible, with proper reflections, shadows, and alignment to the neck and ears. This ensures realistic material rendering and spatial consistency.",
      "question": "Do the pearl choker and earrings cast appropriate shadows on the neck and ear, and do the pearls show consistent size, spacing, and reflective highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
