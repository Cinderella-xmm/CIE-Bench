      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving structural integrity and anatomical accuracy during the 3D transformation, this question evaluates whether the figure's limbs, head, and armor maintain correct proportions and geometry. The original image shows a well-proportioned male figure with defined musculature and layered armor. Any distortion in the 3D model could result in elongated limbs, misshapen joints, or collapsed armor segments, which would compromise authenticity.",
      "question": "Does the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior maintain accurate limb proportions and body structure without distorted joints or exaggerated features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying metallic blue tones to the armor with realistic material properties, this question assesses whether the surface reflects light naturally, showing gradients, highlights, and shadows consistent with polished metal. The original armor has intricate patterns and reflective surfaces; in the edited version, these should remain visible and not appear flat or overly saturated.",
      "question": "Are the metallic blue surfaces of the armor rendered with natural light reflections and depth, avoiding flat or uniform coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the trident’s imposing stature and correct scale relative to the figure, this question checks if the trident is proportionally sized and structurally intact. In the original image, the trident is large and held firmly; in the 3D model, it must not appear shrunken, bent, or detached from the hand.",
      "question": "Is the trident positioned correctly in the hand and scaled appropriately relative to the figure, without bending or truncation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the marine-themed dome must be visually coherent with no geometric artifacts, this question evaluates whether the dome’s curvature is smooth, its transparency consistent, and its edges clean. Artifacts such as jagged lines, unnatural refractions, or mismatched lighting would indicate poor rendering quality.",
      "question": "Does the dome enclosing the model have smooth curvature and consistent transparency without visible stitching, warping, or reflection anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the faux coral reef base must exhibit natural textures and proportional scaling, this question examines whether the base supports the model realistically and displays organic shapes typical of coral formations. Artificial-looking patterns or disproportionate size would break visual credibility.",
      "question": "Is the coral reef base textured with natural-looking organic patterns and scaled appropriately to support the model without appearing undersized or oversized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that miniature ocean currents must simulate fluid motion without violating physical plausibility, this question checks if the currents flow smoothly around the model, follow logical directionality, and do not appear as static or disconnected particles.",
      "question": "Do the swirling ocean currents around the model follow continuous, directional flow paths without abrupt breaks or floating fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the hand gripping the trident must conform to human anatomy, this question verifies the number of fingers, joint alignment, and grip posture. The original image shows a five-fingered hand with natural positioning; any deviation would suggest digital manipulation errors.",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the trident have exactly five fingers with natural joint angles and grip pressure, without extra digits or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the overall composition must maintain spatial logic, this question checks whether all elements—the model, dome, base, and currents—are aligned in a coherent 3D space. Misalignment, floating objects, or incorrect layering would reduce visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are all elements (model, dome, base, currents) spatially aligned and layered correctly, with no floating or disconnected parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
