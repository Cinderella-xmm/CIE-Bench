    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the makeup brushes into crystal wands with gemstone tops, evaluate whether the new shapes maintain proportional consistency with the original brush sizes and whether the materials (crystal and gemstones) appear natural and free from artifacts such as jagged edges, unnatural transparency, or inconsistent surface textures.",
      "question": "Do the crystal wands have smooth, continuous surfaces with consistent refraction and no visible digital artifacts or irregularities in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the glass jar with a transparent crystal vase featuring etched floral patterns, assess whether the vase exhibits symmetrical structure, realistic translucency, and clearly defined etched patterns that follow natural depth cues and do not appear flattened or artificially pasted.",
      "question": "Are the etched floral patterns on the crystal vase evenly distributed, continuous, and visually integrated into the surface without breaking lines or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the lace band into a carved crystal ribbon, check whether the ribbon retains the original floral design in a three-dimensional, solid form, with no loss of detail, gaps, or artificial seams that suggest layering or poor rendering.",
      "question": "Is the carved crystal ribbon fully formed with intact floral motifs and no visible breaks, overlaps, or flattened areas that suggest a 2D-to-3D conversion error?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the arrangement on a mirrored surface, verify that the reflection beneath the vase accurately mirrors the objects above, including correct angles, clarity, and alignment, without distortions such as ghosting, misalignment, or missing elements.",
      "question": "Does the reflection on the mirrored surface show a clear, undistorted image of the crystal vase and its contents, with proper symmetry and matching lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of retaining the pearls inside the vase, evaluate whether the pearls maintain their original spherical shape, spacing, and reflective quality, and whether they appear unaffected by unnatural lighting or compression caused by the new crystal environment.",
      "question": "Are the pearls uniformly sized, evenly spaced, and free from warping or blurring that suggests compression or incorrect rendering due to the crystal vase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
