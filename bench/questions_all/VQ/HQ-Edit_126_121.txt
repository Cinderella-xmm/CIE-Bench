Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction involves transforming the original image of a gorilla holding bananas into a cereal box design titled "Jungle Crunch." This requires adding new elements such as packaging layout, text, color scheme (vibrant greens and yellows), banana motifs, leafy tropical accents, and a back panel with illustrations and fun facts. The central artwork must retain the gorilla and bananas from the original image but be integrated into a new context. The key perceptual quality concerns are whether the integration maintains realism and natural appearance, avoids artifacts, preserves structural coherence, and ensures physical plausibility of added elements. The original image features a highly detailed, realistic gorilla in a jungle environment with soft lighting and mist, so any edits must not disrupt this visual authenticity.

-Sub requirement 1: The central artwork of the gorilla holding bananas must be preserved without distortion or unnatural modifications, ensuring that its proportions, textures, and lighting remain consistent with the original image’s realism.

-Sub requirement 2: The addition of the cereal box packaging must not introduce unnatural edges, mismatched lighting, or texture inconsistencies when superimposed over the gorilla and background, especially around the borders of the box and where it overlaps with the gorilla.

-Sub requirement 3: The colors used in the packaging (vibrant greens and yellows) must harmonize with the original scene’s color palette without creating jarring contrasts or artificial-looking hues.

-Sub requirement 4: Banana motifs and leafy tropical accents must be seamlessly integrated into the design without appearing as pasted-on graphics with visible seams or incorrect shadows.

-Sub requirement 5: The back panel illustration, including the jungle scene and fun facts, must maintain visual credibility by using plausible proportions, correct perspective, and natural textures, avoiding cartoonish distortions that would break immersion.

-Sub requirement 6: Text elements such as "Jungle Crunch" must be legible, stylistically appropriate, and positioned without obscuring critical details of the gorilla or bananas.

-Sub requirement 7: The overall composition must preserve spatial logic—e.g., the gorilla should appear to hold the bananas within the context of the box, not floating or disconnected from the package structure.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that the central artwork of the gorilla holding bananas must be preserved without distortion, evaluate whether the gorilla’s facial features, fur texture, and hand positioning remain consistent with the original image. Specifically, check if the fingers are correctly shaped and count (five per hand), and if the bananas are held naturally without unnatural bending or clipping.
Question: Are the gorilla's hands holding the bananas with five fingers each, and do the fingers have natural curvature and skin texture without deformation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that the cereal box packaging must not introduce unnatural edges or lighting mismatches, assess the boundary between the gorilla and the box. Check for sharp, artificial edges, inconsistent lighting, or shadow discrepancies that suggest poor integration.
Question: Does the edge of the cereal box blend naturally with the gorilla and background, without visible seams or lighting discontinuities?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that vibrant greens and yellows must harmonize with the original scene, evaluate whether the added colors in the packaging match the ambient lighting and do not create unnatural highlights or flat areas.
Question: Are the green and yellow colors on the cereal box consistent with the lighting and tone of the jungle environment, without abrupt shifts or oversaturated patches?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that banana motifs and leafy accents must be seamlessly integrated, check if these elements cast proper shadows, have correct depth, and do not appear as flat overlays with no interaction with the surrounding surfaces.
Question: Do the banana motifs and leaf patterns on the box have realistic shadows and depth, matching the lighting direction of the scene?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that the back panel illustration must maintain visual credibility, evaluate whether the jungle scene includes proportionally accurate animals, plants, and terrain, and whether the text placement does not obscure key elements.
Question: Is the back panel illustration composed with correct perspective and scale, and is the text clearly readable without covering important parts of the gorilla or bananas?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
