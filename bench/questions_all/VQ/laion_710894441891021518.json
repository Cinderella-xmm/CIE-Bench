      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the bonsai's branches into butterfly wings, this evaluation focuses on whether the new wing structures maintain plausible geometry and avoid distortion. The original branches have defined angles and tapering forms; the edited version should not exhibit broken lines, jagged edges, or unnatural curvature that contradicts botanical or biological form.",
      "question": "Do the butterfly wings formed from the branches have smooth, continuous outlines without visible breaks, warping, or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding luminescent patterns to the butterfly wings, this evaluates whether the glow effect appears integrated and natural within the wing surface. The pattern should not float unnaturally, show pixelation, or create halo artifacts around edges.",
      "question": "Are the luminescent patterns on the butterfly wings evenly distributed with soft edges and no visible digital artifacts like halos or sharp contrast jumps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing pink blossoms with glowing eyes and antlers, this assesses whether the new features are proportionally correct and spatially coherent. Eyes should be symmetrically placed and sized appropriately relative to the branch structure; antlers should emerge naturally from the top of the tree without clipping or overlapping errors.",
      "question": "Are the glowing eyes and antlers positioned in a way that respects the original branching structure, with no unnatural overlaps or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the teal ceramic pot into an ancient stone base with carvings, this checks whether the material change is convincing. The stone should display natural grain, weathering, and carving depth consistent with aged stone, without flat textures or unrealistic shadows.",
      "question": "Does the stone base retain natural stone texture, including subtle variations in color and surface depth, without appearing uniformly flat or artificially rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enhancing the trunk with bark-like textures resembling flowing robes, this evaluates whether the texture transition is seamless and physically plausible. The robe-like folds should follow the trunk’s shape without abrupt changes in thickness or direction.",
      "question": "Do the bark-like textures on the trunk flow continuously along its contours without sudden breaks, unnatural ridges, or inconsistent scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving fine details such as leaves, roots, and soil, this checks whether the editing process degraded any original fine features. Leaves should remain crisp, soil texture visible, and root system intact beneath the transformation.",
      "question": "Are the remaining leaves, soil, and root structures clearly visible and undistorted, with no blurring, loss of edge definition, or missing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining overall visual credibility, this evaluates whether lighting and shadows align with the new fantasy elements. Glowing parts should cast appropriate soft glows, and shadows should match the light source direction and object placement.",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements cast subtle ambient light on nearby surfaces, and do shadows from the wings, eyes, and antlers align with the scene’s lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
