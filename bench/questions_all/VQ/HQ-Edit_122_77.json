      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the hair into vine-like tendrils, this question evaluates whether the new hair structure maintains anatomical plausibility and natural texture. The original hair is gray and wavy; replacing it with vines requires that the tendrils follow the natural curvature of the head, maintain consistent thickness, and avoid abrupt transitions or floating segments. The question focuses on texture and geometry.",
      "question": "Do the vine-like tendrils follow the natural contour of the head without floating or breaking apart at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the current floral arrangement with a laurel crown intertwined with pastel flowers, this question checks for proper integration of the new floral elements. The original flowers are soft and realistically placed in the hair. The new laurel crown must be positioned symmetrically, with leaves and blossoms that do not overlap incorrectly or appear clipped. The focus is on spatial alignment and blending.",
      "question": "Are the laurel leaves and pastel flowers aligned naturally within the hair structure without overlapping the face or appearing detached from the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the shawl into a flowing emerald green tunic, this question evaluates the realism of the new garment. The original shawl is dark and textured, covering the shoulders. The tunic must drape logically over the body, with folds that respond to gravity and body shape. The material should show consistent texture and shading without unnatural warping or color shifts.",
      "question": "Does the emerald green tunic show natural fabric folds and shading that match the posture and lighting of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding an ancient grove with twisted olive trees and marble fragments, this question assesses the spatial coherence of the background. The trees must be proportionally sized relative to the subject, with bark texture and branch structure consistent with real olive trees. Marble fragments should lie on the ground in a way that suggests age and decay, not floating or misplaced.",
      "question": "Are the twisted olive trees and marble fragments positioned at a plausible distance from the subject, with correct perspective and no floating or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of capturing an ethereal and timeless essence, this question evaluates the overall lighting and shadow consistency. The lighting must be uniform across the subject and background, with soft shadows that suggest ambient light typical of a forest grove. Harsh contrasts, mismatched highlights, or unnatural glow effects would disrupt visual credibility.",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the subjectâ€™s face and clothing align with the ambient light source suggested by the background environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
