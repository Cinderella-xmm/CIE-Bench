      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the ornate lantern into the centerpiece of a miniature medina scene encased in a glass dome, evaluate whether the addition of the glass dome maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image features a detailed lantern with a metallic base and stained-glass-like body; introducing a glass dome must preserve the proportions and material consistency of the surrounding elements without distorting the lantern or creating unnatural reflections or transparency artifacts.",
      "question": "Is the glass dome enclosing the lantern transparent and smooth, with no visible distortions, cracks, or unnatural refraction patterns that disrupt the perception of depth or clarity?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting tile designs into scaled-down, vibrant ceramic street pavements, assess whether the transformation of the background tiles into a miniature pavement retains geometric accuracy and texture fidelity. The original image has intricate mosaic tiles with precise star and diamond patterns; scaling these into a street-level surface must maintain consistent tiling, color balance, and edge sharpness to avoid visual inconsistencies.",
      "question": "Are the scaled-down ceramic street pavements composed of clearly defined, uniformly sized tiles with accurate color transitions and no blurred or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding small textile merchants with colorful fabric canopies around the base of the lantern, evaluate whether the newly introduced figures and structures are proportionally correct and stylistically coherent. These elements must be tiny relative to the lantern and fit within the scale of a miniature scene, avoiding oversized or awkwardly placed objects that break visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are the textile merchants and their fabric canopies proportionally small compared to the lantern, with realistic shapes and textures that do not appear stretched, duplicated, or unnaturally fused with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating tiny palm trees for ambiance, assess whether the added palm trees maintain natural form and spatial logic. Given the original imageâ€™s architectural style and lighting, the palm trees should have proper leaf structure, shadow casting, and placement that does not interfere with existing geometry or create floating or clipped appearances.",
      "question": "Do the palm trees have properly shaped fronds, rooted bases, and consistent shadows that align with the light source from the lantern, without appearing flat or detached from the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of making the dome's base mimic a weathered, rustic town square, evaluate whether the base surface exhibits natural wear, texture variation, and material authenticity. This area must transition smoothly from the glass dome to the ground, with plausible cracks, stains, or uneven surfaces that reflect aging without introducing artificial noise or inconsistent shading.",
      "question": "Does the base of the dome feature a textured, weathered surface with subtle variations in tone and depth, free from uniform patterns or digital artifacts that suggest over-processing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
