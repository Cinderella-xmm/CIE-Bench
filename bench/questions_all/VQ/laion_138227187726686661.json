      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the quilt with a LEGO block design, this question evaluates whether the material texture of the quilt has been successfully changed to resemble LEGO tilesâ€”specifically checking for the presence of grid lines, matte surface, and consistent block shapes. The original quilt has soft stitching and fabric folds; the edited version must avoid fabric-like wrinkles or seams and instead show clean, rigid edges typical of LEGO.",
      "question": "Does the quilt display uniform square blocks with visible grid lines and a matte finish consistent with LEGO bricks, without any fabric-like folds or stitching?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of recreating sports balls using round LEGO tile pieces, this question checks whether the circular elements (e.g., football, soccer ball) are proportionally correct and integrated into the grid without distortion. In the original image, these are printed on fabric; in the edited version, they must appear as raised or inset circular tiles within the block structure.",
      "question": "Are the round sports elements (e.g., football, soccer ball) represented as circular LEGO tiles with consistent size and alignment within the square grid, without stretching or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the pillow with a cube of stacked LEGO bricks, this question assesses the structural accuracy of the new pillow. It must be a perfect cube with equal sides, sharp edges, and no gaps between bricks, matching the scale of the bed and the surrounding LEGO elements.",
      "question": "Is the pillow replaced by a cube composed of stacked LEGO bricks with equal dimensions on all sides, right angles, and no visible gaps or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the bed base to a plain white LEGO baseplate, this question evaluates whether the bed frame and foundation now appear flat, seamless, and uniformly white, consistent with a LEGO baseplate. The original bed has a wooden frame and white box spring; the edited version must remove all non-baseplate features.",
      "question": "Is the bed base a flat, white, seamless surface with no visible wood grain, shadows, or depth cues, resembling a standard LEGO baseplate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of setting the background to a smooth white surface, this question checks whether all original environmental elements (walls, window, nightstand, rug, picture) have been removed and replaced with a uniform white backdrop. The lighting should be even without directional shadows or highlights that suggest a real room.",
      "question": "Is the entire background a smooth, uniform white surface with no visible walls, furniture, or windows, and are there no shadows or lighting gradients indicating a physical space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
