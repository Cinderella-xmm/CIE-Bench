Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the rose bush into a mosaic mural with bold ceramic tile borders, evaluate whether the outlined edges around each flower are consistent in thickness and style, and whether they appear as intentional artistic borders rather than jagged or broken lines that suggest digital artifacts. The editing targets are the white and light pink roses in the foreground, particularly those near the center and right side of the image.
Question: Are the outlines around each rose petal uniform, continuous, and free of pixelation or irregular breaks that would indicate an unnatural transition from organic form to mosaic pattern?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of rendering petals and leaves in pearl and jade hues, assess whether the color transformation maintains natural tonal gradients and avoids abrupt shifts or unnatural glows. Focus on the central cluster of white roses and surrounding green foliage to determine if the new material appearance (pearl/jade) retains plausible surface textures without introducing artificial shine or inconsistent shading.
Question: Do the petals exhibit smooth transitions between light and dark areas consistent with pearl-like reflectivity, and do the leaves show subtle jade-like translucency without visible texture distortion or unnatural sheen?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of abstracting the red brick building using terracotta tile shades while integrating architectural motifs into the mosaic pattern, evaluate whether the brickwork retains recognizable structural elements such as window arches and corner buttresses, but now rendered in a stylized tile format. Check for continuity between the original architectural forms and their abstracted versions, especially around the arched window and vertical brick columns.
Question: Are the architectural features like the arched window and corner pilasters preserved in shape and proportion despite being converted into terracotta-colored tiles, and do they align seamlessly with adjacent mosaic sections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence between the mosaic mural and the background architecture, assess whether the spatial depth and layering remain logical. Specifically, check if the rose bush appears to be in front of the building as in the original image, and whether the mosaic conversion does not cause overlapping inconsistencies or misalignment between foreground flowers and background structures.
Question: Does the mosaic rose bush maintain correct spatial placement relative to the building behind it, with no floating or misplaced elements suggesting incorrect depth perception?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of avoiding unnatural textures and loss of fine details during style conversion, examine the leaf veins, petal edges, and brick mortar lines to ensure they are not blurred, fragmented, or replaced by generic patterns. Pay particular attention to areas where high detail is present in the original—such as the layered petals of the large white rose on the right—and verify that these have been stylized without losing essential structure.
Question: Are the fine details such as petal layers, leaf venation, and brick joints preserved in a stylized yet coherent manner, without appearing smeared, distorted, or replaced by flat, featureless surfaces?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
