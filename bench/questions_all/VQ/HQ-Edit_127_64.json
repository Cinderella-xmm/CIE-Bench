      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding stylized seating icons in the \"Relax\" section on the grassy areas near the right side of the path, evaluate whether these icons maintain spatial consistency with existing figures and ground surfaces. The addition should not distort shadows, alter surface textures, or create floating or misaligned objects.",
      "question": "Are the stylized seating icons positioned on the grass without overlapping or displacing real people or objects, and do they cast consistent shadows matching the sun's direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of inserting speech bubble graphics for park conversations along the central pathway where people are walking, assess whether these bubbles interfere with the natural posture or spacing of individuals. The bubbles must appear at plausible distances from heads and not clip through bodies or paths.",
      "question": "Do the speech bubble graphics appear above or near walking figures without intersecting limbs or clothing, and are they proportionally sized relative to the human figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing a camera icon incorporating the Eiffel Tower in the \"Capture\" section, evaluate whether the icon is geometrically aligned with the actual tower and maintains consistent lighting and texture. It must not appear warped or disconnected from the background.",
      "question": "Is the camera icon featuring the Eiffel Tower correctly scaled and positioned so that its outline matches the tower's silhouette and does not exhibit distortion or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of overlaying clean typography and dividing the image vertically along the pathway, check if the division line follows the path's alignment and if the text does not obstruct critical visual elements like the Eiffel Tower base or tree tops.",
      "question": "Does the vertical split line align with the center of the pathway and extend consistently from foreground to background without cutting through key structures like the Eiffel Tower or hedges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying cool green tones and stylized silhouettes, evaluate whether the color grading affects natural elements like skin tones, sky, and foliage in a way that preserves visual fidelity. The transition between original and stylized regions should not show abrupt shifts or unnatural gradients.",
      "question": "Are the cool green tones applied uniformly across the image without causing visible color banding, loss of detail in shadows, or unnatural saturation in the sky or leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
