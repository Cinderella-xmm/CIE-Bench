Q1:
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the entire photo into a bright and soft watercolor style while maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility, judge if the overall transformation maintains a sense of realism and natural appearance.
Question: Does the watercolor effect applied across the image retain the structural coherence of the skater's pose and the ramp's form?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes


Q2:
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of rendering the ground and background buildings with semi-abstract brushstrokes and slightly blurred colors, assess if these modifications introduce unnatural textures or artifacts.
Question: Are the semi-abstract brushstrokes and blurred colors used for the ground and background buildings free from unnatural textures and artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes


Q3:
Thinking process: Focusing on the sub requirement of ensuring the retained core elements like the skater maintain structural consistency and visual credibility despite the watercolor transition, evaluate if the skater’s proportions and physical characteristics remain intact.
Question: Has the skater’s body and clothing retained their proportions and physical rationality after applying the watercolor style?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes


Q4:
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement of achieving a bright and soft watercolor effect that does not degrade fine details, examine if important details on the skater's clothing or the ramp surface are preserved.
Question: Do the details on the skater's gray t-shirt and black shoes remain discernible after the watercolor treatment?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes


Q5:
Thinking process: Considering the visual content of the image, particularly the hand positions described in the editing instructions, assess if the hands of the skater preserve their natural appearance and structural consistency.
Question: Have the shapes and lines of the skater’s hands remained ergonomic and natural under the watercolor transformation?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
