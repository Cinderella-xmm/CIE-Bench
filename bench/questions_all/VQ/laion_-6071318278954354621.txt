Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the woman’s vibrant, textured jacket into an intricately embroidered silk gown with rich gold and crimson hues, this involves a significant style and material change. The editing position is the upper body garment (from shoulders to waist), which originally features fringed, multicolored knit textures. The new gown must maintain structural coherence with the figure's proportions and avoid unnatural folds or fabric distortions. The evaluation focuses on whether the texture, color, and pattern of the new gown appear consistent with real silk embroidery and do not introduce artifacts such as pixelation, misaligned stitching, or inconsistent lighting.
Question: Does the embroidered silk gown on the woman's upper body display natural fabric draping and consistent texture without visible seams, blurring, or unnatural color transitions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: The original hat is a black wide-brimmed fedora, which is being replaced with a feathered velvet cap. This transformation involves changing both material (from felt to velvet) and adding feathers, which are delicate elements requiring precise rendering. The editing position is the headwear area. The visual credibility depends on whether the cap conforms to the head shape, has realistic feather placement, and integrates naturally with the hair and facial structure without floating or clipping artifacts.
Question: Is the feathered velvet cap positioned correctly on the head, with feathers extending naturally without overlapping the face or appearing detached from the base?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: The original background is an urban street scene with pedestrians, buildings, and vehicles. It is being replaced with an ornate palatial corridor. This full-background replacement must preserve depth, perspective, and lighting consistency with the foreground subject. The editing position spans the entire background behind the woman. The evaluation checks for seamless integration, absence of edges, and proper scale relative to the person. Artifacts like ghosting, mismatched shadows, or incorrect vanishing points would compromise authenticity.
Question: Does the palatial corridor background align properly with the subject's perspective, showing consistent depth and lighting without visible seams or distortion at the edges of the figure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The original image shows the woman holding a brown paper shopping bag in her right hand. The instruction replaces this with a delicate lace fan. The editing position is the right hand and its object. The hand must retain anatomical correctness (five fingers, natural pose), and the fan must appear held in a plausible grip. The material of the fan should show fine lace details without blur or jagged edges. Structural consistency includes whether the fan’s size and angle match typical handheld fans.
Question: Is the lace fan held in the right hand with natural finger positioning, correct number of fingers, and no deformation or clipping against the hand?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The original outfit includes a layered, fringed jacket over a short skirt and black bralette. The transformation requires replacing the jacket with a Renaissance-style gown while preserving the lower body silhouette and leg exposure. The editing position is the torso and hip area. The transition between the gown and the existing shorts must be smooth, avoiding unnatural gaps or fabric tearing. The material shift from textured knit to silk must not cause inconsistencies in shadow, reflection, or edge definition.
Question: Does the transition between the newly added silk gown and the lower garment (shorts) appear seamless, with no visible gaps, unnatural creases, or conflicting material textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
