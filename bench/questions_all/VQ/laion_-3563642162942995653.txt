Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the military truck into a crystal sculpture with reflective emerald and jade facets, evaluate whether the material transformation of the entire truck body maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows a solid metal truck with defined panels and joints; replacing these with layered crystal planes must preserve geometric integrity while introducing refractive surfaces. The question checks if the transition from metallic to crystalline material results in unnatural textures or broken geometry.
Question: Are the crystal facets on the truck's cabin and body uniformly shaped and aligned with the original panel lines, without visible breaks or misaligned edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing muddy wheels with transparent quartz, assess whether the wheel structure retains its original physical form (six tires, dual rear axles) but now composed of clear, detailed quartz. The original wheels are large, rugged, and caked in mud—replacing them with quartz requires maintaining correct proportions and axle alignment while ensuring transparency does not introduce distortion or floating elements.
Question: Do the transparent quartz wheels maintain the same size, spacing, and axle alignment as the original muddy wheels, with no floating or misplaced components?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of enhancing intricate detailing on the quartz wheels, evaluate whether the internal structure of the wheels shows realistic crystalline patterns without artificial-looking lines or unnatural refractions. The original wheels have visible lug nuts and hubcaps; these should be preserved or transformed into crystal equivalents with plausible internal detail.
Question: Are the quartz wheels internally detailed with natural-looking crystal lattice structures that follow the shape of the original hubs and rims, without jagged or inconsistent lines?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of positioning the crystal truck on a sleek white marble platform, assess whether the platform is seamlessly integrated beneath the vehicle without gaps, shadows, or distortions. The original ground is muddy and uneven; placing a smooth marble surface underneath must not disrupt the vehicle’s grounding or create an unnatural elevation.
Question: Is the white marble platform flat, continuous, and properly supporting the entire underside of the crystal truck, with no visible gaps or floating sections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of ensuring surfaces catch and refract colors, evaluate whether the crystal surfaces reflect ambient light in a physically plausible way. The original truck has matte green paint; converting it to reflective emerald and jade facets must show color shifts and light interactions consistent with real crystal behavior, avoiding overly bright or unrealistic glows.
Question: Do the crystal surfaces display subtle color refraction and reflections consistent with emerald and jade materials, without unnatural glowing patches or excessive chromatic aberration?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
