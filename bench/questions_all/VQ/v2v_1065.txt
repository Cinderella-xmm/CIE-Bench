Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of maintaining the overall realism and natural appearance while transforming the character into a chibi-style 3D figure, we need to assess if the transformation retains the structural coherence and visual plausibility of the character's pose and proportions.
Question: Does the chibi-style 3D figure maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the skateboarder's mid-action pose without distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of ensuring the natural appearance and absence of artifacts during the addition of tiny palm trees and ramps inside the snow globe, we need to evaluate if these new elements blend seamlessly with the existing scene.
Question: Are the tiny palm trees and ramps inside the snow globe naturally integrated into the scene without introducing unnatural textures or broken geometric shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement of avoiding unnatural textures and loss of details, especially concerning the character's clothing and skateboard, we need to check if these elements retain their fine details after the transformation.
Question: Do the character's clothing and skateboard retain their fine details and natural textures inside the snow globe?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility, particularly regarding the snow globe's placement on the table near a window, we need to verify if the composition and lighting effects are visually credible.
Question: Does the snow globe resting on the table near the window appear structurally consistent and visually credible with realistic light scattering effects?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of ensuring the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the scene, especially the snow falling inside the snow globe, we need to assess if the snowfall effect looks natural and enhances the lively atmosphere.
Question: Does the snow falling inside the snow globe look natural and enhance the lively atmosphere without appearing artificial or out of place?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
