      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a logo on the hammer handle, evaluate whether the logo integration maintains natural appearance and material consistency with the wooden handle. The editing position is the hammer’s wooden handle, which is centrally located on the workbench. The addition of a logo must not introduce unnatural textures, color mismatches, or distortions in the wood grain. The logo should appear as if it were naturally applied (e.g., engraved or branded), without visible artifacts like pixelation, misalignment, or artificial edges.",
      "question": "Is the logo on the hammer handle seamlessly integrated with no visible texture mismatch, jagged edges, or unnatural color contrast compared to the surrounding wood?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating elegant typography on wood shavings, assess whether the text appears physically plausible on the thin, curled wood shavings. The editing position includes multiple scattered wood shavings across the workbench surface. Text added to such small, curved surfaces must respect the curvature and thickness of the shavings; otherwise, it may appear flat, distorted, or unnaturally sharp. The typography should not violate the physical properties of wood shaving material.",
      "question": "Do the letters on the wood shavings follow the natural curvature and thickness of each shaving without appearing flattened, stretched, or floating above the surface?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a rustic textured banner at the top of the image, evaluate whether the banner integrates naturally into the scene without disrupting the composition or introducing visual inconsistencies. The banner would be placed along the upper edge of the pegboard or above the tools. It must match the lighting, shadow direction, and material texture of the surrounding environment. Any mismatch in depth, lighting, or texture would reduce perceived authenticity.",
      "question": "Does the rustic banner at the top align with the lighting and shadows of the scene, and does its texture appear consistent with natural aged wood or fabric rather than digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the pegboard to grayscale with copper accents, evaluate whether the color transformation preserves structural coherence and avoids unnatural transitions. The pegboard is the dark perforated background wall behind the tools. Converting it to grayscale while adding copper-colored elements (such as hooks or tool handles) requires that the copper tones blend realistically with the monochrome background—without harsh contrasts, unnatural highlights, or color bleeding. The metallic sheen must appear physically plausible under the ambient light.",
      "question": "Are the copper accents on the pegboard evenly lit and shaded, matching the surrounding grayscale tones without creating unrealistic reflections or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a sleek, minimalist business card design behind the tools, assess whether the card appears correctly positioned and visually credible within the scene. The business card would be placed near the back edge of the workbench, possibly partially obscured by tools or shadow. It must maintain proper perspective, scale, and lighting consistency with other objects. A misplaced or overly bright card could break immersion.",
      "question": "Is the business card positioned with correct perspective and scale relative to the tools and workbench, and does it cast a subtle shadow consistent with the ambient light source?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
