Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of avoiding unnatural textures and loss of details, evaluate if the skater's clothing retains its texture and detail after the style conversion.
Question: Are the textures and details of the skater's clothing natural and free of artifacts in the 3D cartoon rendering?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3:

Question: Do the skill stats and bars appear naturally integrated into the character card without disrupting the overall visual flow?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the sub requirement of preserving the natural appearance and avoiding distortion, examine if the skater's pose and proportions remain realistic in the 3D cartoon style.
Question: Is the skater's pose and body proportions depicted naturally and without distortion in the 3D cartoon aesthetic?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5:
