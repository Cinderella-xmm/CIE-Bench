      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the red double-decker buses with hovering mechanical sentinels, this question evaluates whether the mechanical form retains structural coherence and natural material appearance. The original buses are clearly visible in the foreground and midground. The edited version must show no broken edges, missing parts, or unnatural textures on the mechanical bodies. The glowing blue underlights must appear as smooth, continuous light sources without pixelation or halo artifacts.",
      "question": "Do the mechanical sentinels replacing the buses have intact geometric shapes, smooth surfaces, and consistent glowing blue underlights without visible rendering artifacts?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming Big Ben into a golden automaton with a cosmic eye clockface, this question checks whether the material transition from stone to gold is visually credible and whether the clockface modification preserves symmetry and proportion. The tower is a tall vertical structure on the right side of the image. The golden surface must not show patchy textures or seams, and the cosmic eye must be centered and aligned with the original clock position.",
      "question": "Does the golden automaton version of Big Ben have uniform metallic texture, proper vertical alignment, and a centrally placed cosmic eye clockface without distortion?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding pulsating energetic vines to the Houses of Parliament, this question evaluates whether the vines grow naturally along the building's surface, avoiding clipping through windows or spires. The vines must follow curved paths consistent with plant growth and emit soft, even pulses of light without flickering or jagged edges.",
      "question": "Are the energetic vines wrapped around the Houses of Parliament following plausible growth patterns, maintaining consistent glow, and not intersecting through solid architectural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding airships with iridescent scales in the sky, this question assesses whether the airships are correctly sized relative to the buildings below, positioned at a plausible altitude, and have smooth, reflective surfaces. They must not cast shadows inconsistent with the sun direction or appear too sharp against the sky gradient.",
      "question": "Are the airships in the sky properly scaled, positioned at a reasonable altitude, and displaying iridescent surfaces without harsh edges or shadow mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining lighting consistency across all edits, this question checks whether the added glowing elements (underlights, cosmic eye, vines, airships) match the warm golden-hour lighting of the original scene. There should be no abrupt changes in brightness, unnatural highlights, or dark areas that contradict the ambient illumination.",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements (underlights, cosmic eye, vines, airships) blend with the ambient lighting of the scene without creating overly bright spots or unnatural contrast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
