Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the unicorn into a ceramic sculpture with a smooth, glazed surface in creamy white, this involves a material transformation of the entire body. The original image shows a fluffy, textured fur coat, so the edited version must replace this with a uniform, non-porous, glossy surface consistent with glazed porcelain. This change affects overall realism and natural appearance if not executed uniformly or if textures remain inconsistent.
Question: Is the surface of the unicorn’s body uniformly smooth and reflective, resembling a glazed ceramic finish without patches of residual fur texture?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: The editing instruction specifies replacing the mane and tail with delicate porcelain curls. In the original image, the mane and tail are long, flowing, and fibrous. The edited version must replace these with curled, fragile-looking porcelain elements that maintain structural coherence and avoid unnatural rigidity or floating fragments. This affects visual credibility if curls appear disconnected or misaligned with the head and body.
Question: Are the mane and tail composed of thin, curved porcelain-like structures that follow the natural flow of the original hair and are securely attached to the head and base of the tail without floating or breaking apart?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: The horn is instructed to be redesigned as a polished metallic spiral. In the original image, the horn is a single, straight, translucent white spike. The new version must transform it into a spiraling, metallic structure that maintains proportion and attachment point at the forehead. Any mismatch in scale, angle, or material continuity would compromise structural consistency and visual plausibility.
Question: Does the horn form a continuous, symmetrical spiral shape made of reflective metallic material, originating from the same position as the original horn and maintaining proportional size relative to the head?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The background is to be changed to a minimalist gallery setting with a gently textured stone base. The original image features a dark forest with mossy ground and trees. The edited version must replace this environment with a clean, neutral space—such as a stone platform with soft lighting—without leaving traces of the original forest elements. This affects overall authenticity if the transition between the sculpture and background appears abrupt or inconsistent.
Question: Is the unicorn positioned on a flat, subtly textured stone base that contrasts with the original forest floor, with no visible remnants of trees, dirt, or foliage in the immediate surroundings?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The editing instruction requires the sculpture to retain its mythical elegance through composition and lighting. The original image has dramatic moonlight and shadow play. The edited version must preserve a sense of elegance through balanced lighting that highlights the glaze and porcelain details without creating harsh reflections or shadows that contradict the gallery setting. This affects perceived quality if lighting appears inconsistent with the new environment.
Question: Is the lighting on the sculpture soft and directional, casting subtle highlights on the glazed surface and porcelain curls, consistent with indoor gallery illumination rather than outdoor moonlight?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
