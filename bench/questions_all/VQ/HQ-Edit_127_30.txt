Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the violin body into a sleek, logo-engraved case with velvet lining, evaluate whether the material transformation at the violin's body (originally wooden) maintains structural coherence and natural appearance. The original image shows a polished wooden violin body with visible grain and curvature; replacing it with a case-like structure requires assessing if the new surface texture, lighting response, and edges align with realistic materials and geometry.
Question: Does the transformed violin body maintain consistent surface texture and lighting behavior with a high-quality engraved case, without unnatural sheen or texture mismatches?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding gold accents to the chinrest and tailpiece, assess whether these metallic additions appear physically plausible in terms of color, reflectivity, and integration with surrounding materials. The original image shows dark ebony chinrest and tailpiece components; introducing gold must preserve geometric continuity and avoid abrupt transitions or artificial highlights.
Question: Are the gold accents on the chinrest and tailpiece seamlessly integrated with no visible seams, unnatural reflections, or color bleeding into adjacent areas?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of introducing an elegant, scripted font along the strings, evaluate whether the text placement respects physical constraints—strings are thin and taut—and whether the font appears as if printed or etched onto a fine wire without distorting its shape or creating visual artifacts like pixelation or floating letters.
Question: Is the scripted font along the strings clearly legible, aligned with string curvature, and free from distortion or floating effects that suggest digital overlay errors?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of designing a sophisticated pedestal stand with ornate wooden details reminiscent of vintage furniture, evaluate whether the new stand’s design matches the proportions and style of the original red velvet ottoman beneath the violin. The original image features a classic-style footstool with curved legs; the replacement stand must maintain similar scale, material consistency, and structural plausibility.
Question: Does the newly designed pedestal stand have proportionally correct legs and decorative elements that match the vintage aesthetic without appearing undersized, misaligned, or structurally unstable?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the violin into a luxury branding piece while retaining core structural elements, assess whether the overall composition preserves the original instrument’s silhouette and balance. The transformation should not alter fundamental geometry (e.g., f-holes, bridge, scroll) in ways that break spatial logic or create impossible angles.
Question: Are the key structural components of the violin—such as the f-holes, bridge, and scroll—still present in accurate positions and proportions relative to each other, even after modifications?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
