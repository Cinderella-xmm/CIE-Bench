Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction requires transforming the original image into a Victorian-era painting, which involves a complete stylistic and thematic overhaul. This includes replacing the kimono with a lavish brocade gown featuring puffy sleeves, changing cherry blossoms to roses, and reimagining the background as an ornate English garden with wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues. These changes affect multiple elements in the image: the woman’s clothing, the flora, and the entire environment. Each of these transformations must preserve structural coherence, avoid artifacts, and maintain visual plausibility under the new theme. The original image features a woman in a flowing floral kimono playing a violin under a cherry blossom tree, so the edits will target her attire, the tree canopy, ground cover, and distant landscape. The transformation must not introduce distortions in proportions, textures, or lighting.

-Sub requirement 1: Replace the woman's kimono with a Victorian-style brocade gown featuring puffy sleeves—evaluate whether the new gown maintains natural fabric folds, realistic texture, proper proportion relative to the body, and anatomical consistency without distorting limbs or posture.

-Sub requirement 2: Replace cherry blossoms with elegant roses—assess whether the new flowers are correctly positioned on branches, have natural petal shapes and color gradients, and do not appear unnaturally clustered or misaligned with branch structure.

-Sub requirement 3: Reimagine the background as an ornate English garden with wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues—check if these structures are geometrically sound, properly scaled, and integrated into the scene without floating or inconsistent perspective.

-Sub requirement 4: Ensure the overall scene conveys opulence and tranquility—evaluate whether lighting, color harmony, and composition support this mood without introducing jarring contrasts or unnatural shadows.

-Sub requirement 5: Maintain structural coherence between the violin and the woman’s hands—verify that hand positioning is ergonomically plausible, fingers count correct (no more than five), and bowing motion appears natural.

-Sub requirement 6: Avoid artifacts such as texture repetition, blurred edges, or missing fine details in materials like brocade, metalwork, or foliage—ensure all added elements have consistent resolution and detail level matching the rest of the image.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the kimono with a Victorian brocade gown featuring puffy sleeves, this question evaluates whether the new garment has natural fabric draping, realistic texture, and proper volume without distorting the figure or creating unnatural creases. The position is the woman’s torso and arms, where the gown should follow human anatomy.
Question: Does the brocade gown have natural-looking folds and volume in the puffy sleeves and skirt, with no stretched or flattened areas that contradict fabric behavior?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing cherry blossoms with roses, this question checks whether the new flowers are realistically shaped and attached to branches, avoiding mismatched geometry or unnatural clustering. The editing position is the tree canopy and surrounding air space where petals fall.
Question: Are the rose blossoms evenly distributed along the branches with natural petal shapes and color variation, and do they align with the direction of light without appearing pasted or duplicated?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues in the background, this question assesses whether these structures are geometrically accurate, properly scaled, and integrated into the depth of the scene without floating or perspective errors. The editing position is the mid-to-far background.
Question: Do the wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues have consistent line work, proper shadowing, and spatial alignment with the ground plane and surrounding trees?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence in the violin-playing action, this question evaluates the realism of the woman’s hands holding the violin and bow. The editing position is her left hand on the neck of the violin and right hand holding the bow.
Question: Does the left hand have five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and does the right hand grip the bow in a physically plausible manner without extra digits or distorted joints?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts in material textures, this question checks whether the brocade pattern, ironwork, and stone surfaces exhibit consistent detail and no visible repetition, blurring, or edge artifacts. The editing positions include the gown’s surface, gazebo railings, and statue surfaces.
Question: Are the brocade patterns on the gown, the metal mesh of the gazebo, and the stone texture of the statues free from repeating tiles, pixelation, or unnatural smoothness that suggests low-resolution generation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
