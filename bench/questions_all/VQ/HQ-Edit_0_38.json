      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding golden highlights to the grape clusters, evaluate whether the highlights are applied in a way that mimics natural light reflection on the grapes’ surface. The grapes are located on the right side of the image, adjacent to the man’s shoulder. The highlights should follow the curvature of the grapes and align with the ambient lighting direction from the upper left. If the highlights appear flat, overly bright, or disconnected from the grape surface, they may introduce artificiality.",
      "question": "Do the golden highlights on the grape clusters follow the natural curvature and lighting direction of the grapes without appearing as separate, overlaid patches?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of stylizing the cane into a twisted vine design, assess whether the new form maintains continuity with the original wooden material and avoids geometric distortions. The cane is held in the man’s right hand and extends downward along the center-left of the image. The twist should resemble organic vine growth, not mechanical bending. Any abrupt changes in thickness or unnatural angles would compromise structural credibility.",
      "question": "Does the twisted vine design of the cane maintain smooth, continuous curves and proportional thickness consistent with a natural vine, without sharp breaks or irregularities?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding faint ornate filigree to the suit’s pattern, examine whether the filigree blends into the fabric texture without creating visible edges or overlapping layers. The suit is worn by the man, covering his torso and arms. The filigree should be subtle and consistent with the herringbone weave of the vest and jacket. If the filigree appears as a distinct overlay, it could break the illusion of a single textile.",
      "question": "Are the ornate filigree details on the suit’s fabric seamlessly integrated into the existing weave pattern without visible outlines or layering artifacts?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding vineyard-themed symbols in the corner, evaluate whether the symbols are positioned and scaled appropriately within the frame. The corners are empty spaces in the original image, so the symbols should be placed in one or more corners (e.g., bottom left or top right) without obstructing key elements like the man or background landscape. They should match the vintage aesthetic and use earthy tones.",
      "question": "Are the vineyard-themed symbols positioned in the corner(s) of the image at a scale and orientation that integrates naturally with the composition without appearing misplaced or oversized?",

The hand is located on the lower left side of the image, gripping the cane. It should have five fingers with natural joint alignment, skin texture, and shadowing. Any extra fingers, missing digits, or distorted shapes would indicate editing errors.",

Any sudden shifts to bright or unnatural colors (e.g., neon accents) would violate the intended tone. The background vineyard and sky should remain consistent with this palette.",
      "question": "Are all added or modified elements (golden highlights, filigree, symbols, cane design) rendered in colors that fall within the earthy tone range and do not introduce jarring or non-matching hues?",
