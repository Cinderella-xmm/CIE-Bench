Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of modifying Patrick’s shirt to include basketball motifs, this involves altering the graphic design on his jersey. The original image shows Patrick wearing a pink tank top with a white number "3". The editing instruction specifies replacing this with printed basketball-themed graphics. This change affects the texture and pattern of the clothing material, which must maintain visual coherence with the character's overall appearance and avoid unnatural textures or distortions. The evaluation focuses on whether the new pattern integrates naturally into the fabric without introducing artifacts like pixelation, misalignment, or inconsistent shading.
Question: Does the basketball motif on Patrick’s shirt appear seamlessly integrated with the fabric texture, without visible seams, jagged edges, or unnatural color blending?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of changing SpongeBob’s footwear to sneakers with cereal loop patterns, this involves replacing his standard shoes with a custom-designed pair. In the original image, SpongeBob wears black shoes. The new design introduces a thematic pattern that may affect material realism and structural consistency. The evaluation checks whether the shoe shape remains anatomically plausible, the pattern is evenly distributed, and the material appears consistent with typical sneaker textures (e.g., no warped surfaces or unnatural gloss).
Question: Are SpongeBob’s sneakers proportionally accurate and do they feature a clear, consistent cereal loop pattern without distortion or unnatural sheen?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding cereal hoops flying around SpongeBob and Patrick, this introduces new dynamic elements into the scene. These hoops must be visually coherent with the existing environment—appearing as floating objects with proper lighting, shadows, and depth. The evaluation assesses whether these added hoops have realistic shapes, consistent material properties (like matte or glossy finish), and are positioned in a way that respects spatial logic and does not overlap improperly with characters or background elements.
Question: Do the cereal hoops surrounding the characters have consistent circular shapes, appropriate size relative to the figures, and realistic lighting and shadowing that match the scene?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the background with an urban sports scene featuring graffiti-style elements, this involves significant environmental modification. The original background includes a grassy field, sky, and star-shaped elements. Replacing it with an urban setting requires maintaining visual plausibility—graffiti should look hand-drawn, walls should have depth, and the overall composition must not clash with the characters’ cartoon style. The evaluation checks for continuity in artistic style, absence of abrupt transitions, and realistic rendering of textures such as concrete or spray paint.
Question: Is the urban sports background with graffiti elements stylistically consistent with the characters and free from obvious texture mismatches, such as sharp edges, incorrect lighting, or unnatural surface details?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a bold title “Basketball Breakfast Blitz!” across the top, this involves inserting text into the image. The placement must respect the composition and not obscure key elements. The font style, size, and color must integrate naturally with the scene—avoiding glare, misalignment, or clipping. The evaluation checks whether the text has clean edges, proper contrast, and legibility without distorting surrounding elements or appearing to float unnaturally.
Question: Is the title “Basketball Breakfast Blitz!” clearly readable, properly aligned at the top of the image, and free from blurring, shadow artifacts, or overlapping with other elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
