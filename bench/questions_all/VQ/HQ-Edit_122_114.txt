Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the nest twigs with cogs and gears, this transformation affects the material and structure of the nest located in front of the wooden house. The original image shows a natural twig nest, so replacing it with mechanical components requires evaluating whether the new materials (cogs and gears) are seamlessly integrated without unnatural textures or gaps. The question assesses the authenticity and structural coherence of the replacement.
Question: Are the cogs and gears forming the nest properly aligned and interlocked, showing no visible gaps or floating elements that break geometric continuity?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding copper pipes along the roof of the wooden house, this involves modifying the roofline structure. The original image features a rustic wooden roof with shingles and a chimney. Adding copper pipes requires checking whether they follow realistic placement patterns (e.g., running along edges or downspouts), maintain consistent material texture, and do not introduce distortions such as bending into impossible angles or appearing disconnected.
Question: Do the copper pipes run along the roof edges in a physically plausible manner, with consistent thickness and no abrupt bends or floating sections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the stork’s feathers into metallic plates, this alters the surface texture and material of the bird's body. The original image shows soft, layered feathers. Replacing them with metallic plates must preserve the bird’s anatomical shape while ensuring the plates fit naturally over the body without overlapping incorrectly or distorting proportions.
Question: Are the metallic plates covering the stork’s body arranged in a way that follows the underlying anatomy, without unnatural overlaps or gaps between plates?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of integrating mechanical joints into the stork’s limbs and body to emphasize an industrial aesthetic, this involves modifying the bird’s joints (especially at the neck, wings, and legs). The original image shows smooth, organic joint transitions. Mechanical joints must be structurally coherent—such as hinges or ball sockets—and should not appear misaligned or violate biomechanical logic.
Question: Are the mechanical joints at the stork’s neck, wing, and leg connections properly shaped and positioned to match the movement range of a real bird, without appearing distorted or misplaced?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the overall steampunk theme while preserving structural consistency of the wooden house, the original image includes a chimney, window, and weathered wood texture. The editing must ensure that added mechanical elements (pipes, gears) do not disrupt the integrity of the house’s architecture or create visual inconsistencies like mismatched scale or floating components.
Question: Does the integration of mechanical elements (cogs, pipes) with the wooden house maintain proportional harmony and avoid elements that appear disproportionately large or suspended without support?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
