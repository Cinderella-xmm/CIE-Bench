Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming four brown plastic warrior figures into tropical fish-shaped plush toys. This involves a complete style and material transformation, replacing rigid plastic with soft fabric textures, changing color schemes to vibrant blue, green, red, and yellow patterns, and reshaping the figures into fish-like forms while preserving dynamic poses. The original image shows four distinct minotaur-like warriors in aggressive stances, each holding weapons (axes, swords, shields), with detailed armor and anatomical features such as horns, hooves, and muscular limbs. The transformation must maintain the core pose of each figure but alter their shape and material entirely. Key areas for evaluation include the head/horns, body/limbs, weapons, and overall form. The change from hard plastic to soft fabric introduces risks of unnatural texture transitions, loss of fine details, or geometric distortions due to exaggeration of fins and tails. The background must also be changed from plain white to sandy fabric simulating an underwater scene. Therefore, the following sub requirements are derived:
-Sub requirement 1: Replace the brown plastic material with soft, vibrant fabrics featuring bold patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow—evaluate whether the new material appears natural and consistent across all figures without visible artifacts like pixelation, unnatural sheen, or inconsistent texture mapping.
-Sub requirement 2: Transform the warrior figures into fish-shaped plush toys by exaggerating fins and tails while maintaining dynamic poses—assess whether the structural coherence is preserved, including limb proportions, joint articulation, and anatomical plausibility of the fish-like forms.
-Sub requirement 3: Modify the weapons (axes, swords, shields) into fish-related elements or integrate them into the plush design—check if these elements retain visual credibility and do not appear disjointed or physically impossible in the context of plush toys.
-Sub requirement 4: Ensure the entire composition is arranged on a sandy fabric surface resembling an underwater scene—verify that the background is consistent with the theme and does not introduce unnatural seams or lighting discrepancies.
-Sub requirement 5: Maintain the original dynamic poses of the figures during transformation—evaluate whether the movement and balance of each figure remain structurally sound and visually credible after reshaping into fish forms.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the brown plastic material with soft, vibrant fabrics featuring bold patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow, this question evaluates whether the material transition at the body surface of each figure results in a natural appearance. The original figures have a uniform matte plastic texture; the edited version should show fabric-like softness and pattern continuity without unnatural edges or digital artifacts.
Question: Are the surfaces of all four figures covered in soft-looking fabric with consistent, non-repeating bold patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow, and do they lack visible seams, pixelation, or artificial textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the warrior figures into fish-shaped plush toys by exaggerating fins and tails while maintaining dynamic poses, this question checks the structural integrity of the body transformation. Specifically, it assesses whether the legs and arms have been converted into fins and tails in a way that preserves the original stance and avoids geometric distortion such as broken limbs or disproportionate extensions.
Question: Do the legs and arms of all four figures morph into exaggerated fins and tails in a way that maintains their original dynamic poses without broken geometry or unnatural bends?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of modifying weapons into fish-related elements or integrating them into the plush design, this question examines whether the weapons (axes, swords, shields) have been transformed into plausible parts of the plush toy (e.g., fin shapes, decorative elements) without appearing disconnected or physically impossible. For example, the large axe held by the top-left figure should now resemble a fish tail or dorsal fin rather than a solid metal object.
Question: Have the weapons of each figure been reimagined as integrated fish-like features (such as fins or tail extensions) without floating or misaligned components that break physical logic?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of displaying the plush fish on a sandy fabric surface resembling an underwater scene, this question evaluates the background consistency. The original image has a flat white background; the edited version must show a textured sandy surface with appropriate lighting and depth to simulate an underwater environment. The placement of the figures on this surface must look intentional and grounded.
Question: Is the background a textured sandy fabric surface with subtle shading and depth, and are all four figures positioned naturally on it without floating or clipping issues?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the original dynamic poses during transformation, this question focuses on the hand and limb articulation. The original figures have defined hands gripping weapons; in the plush version, the hands should still appear functional and proportionate even if stylized. The number of fingers should not exceed five, and the grip on any remaining weapon part should look ergonomically plausible.
Question: Do the hands of each figure retain a natural number of fingers (no more than five), maintain ergonomic grip positions, and show no signs of deformation or extra digits?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
