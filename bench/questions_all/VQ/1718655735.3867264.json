      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the fairy into a miniature figure inside a delicate glass dome, evaluate whether the addition of the glass dome introduces unnatural textures or distortions in transparency and reflection. The dome should maintain structural coherence with the fairy’s position and scale, avoiding warping or inconsistent lighting effects that would compromise visual credibility.",
      "question": "Does the glass dome surrounding the fairy have consistent transparency, smooth surface curvature, and realistic reflections without visible artifacts such as jagged edges or unnatural refractions?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the fairy on a polished wooden base, assess whether the base appears physically plausible with natural wood grain, appropriate texture detail, and proper shadowing under the figure. The material must match the perceived scale and context of a miniature display.",
      "question": "Is the wooden base beneath the fairy rendered with realistic wood grain patterns, consistent shading, and no artificial or distorted surface features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating shimmering metallic butterfly wings, evaluate whether the wings retain their original form and structure while gaining a metallic sheen. The texture should reflect light naturally, without pixelation, unnatural gloss, or geometric breaks in the wing veins.",
      "question": "Are the butterfly wings' metallic surfaces evenly lit with subtle highlights and reflections, maintaining intact venation patterns and no visible texture repetition or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding intricate fabric textures to the outfit, assess whether the added textures integrate seamlessly with the existing design of the dress, preserving fine details like embroidery and layering without introducing blurry areas or mismatched material properties.",
      "question": "Do the fabric textures on the fairy’s outfit appear detailed and continuous, with no abrupt transitions, blurring, or inconsistencies in thread patterns or material thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of surrounding the fairy with translucent floating petals and swirling leaves, evaluate whether these elements are rendered with soft translucency, natural motion blur (if applicable), and correct depth integration. They must not overlap incorrectly or appear flat, and should not introduce clipping or ghosting artifacts.",
      "question": "Are the floating petals and leaves positioned at varying depths with soft edges and translucent qualities, showing no overlapping errors, sharpness mismatches, or unnatural placement relative to the fairy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using a soft blue gradient backdrop to emphasize ethereal nature, assess whether the background gradient is smooth and uniform, without banding, noise, or abrupt color shifts that could disrupt the magical atmosphere.",
      "question": "Is the blue gradient background smoothly transitioned without visible color bands, pixelation, or irregularities in tone distribution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
