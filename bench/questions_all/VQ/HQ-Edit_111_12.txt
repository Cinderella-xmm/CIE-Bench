Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of enlarging the knitting needles, this action affects the proportion and physical rationality of the objects in the hands. The original image shows the lady holding standard-sized knitting needles that fit naturally within her hands. Enlarging them may lead to distortions such as unnatural hand positioning, disproportionate needle-to-hand scale, or broken geometric shapes (e.g., bent or stretched needles). Therefore, we evaluate whether the enlarged needles maintain structural consistency with the hand’s grip and avoid deformation.
Question: Are the enlarged knitting needles proportionally consistent with the size of the woman's hands and aligned naturally with her fingers without bending or stretching?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding steamy cup detail with swirling lines, the original image contains a white teacup on a saucer placed on a side table. The addition of steam must follow realistic flow patterns—swirling lines should originate from the cup and rise upward in a natural, physics-consistent manner. Any unnatural line direction, inconsistent thickness, or abrupt cutoffs would indicate artifacts or poor integration.
Question: Do the steam lines above the teacup rise smoothly from the rim in a continuous, curved pattern without sharp breaks or unnatural angles?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the quilt texture into yarn patterns, the original image shows a teal knitted fabric draped over the woman’s lap. This transformation involves altering surface texture while preserving the overall appearance of knitted material. If the texture becomes overly stylized or lacks coherence with real yarn behavior (e.g., mismatched stitch patterns, irregular loops), it may appear artificial. We assess whether the yarn pattern maintains visual credibility and textural authenticity.
Question: Does the transformed yarn pattern on the fabric retain consistent knit stitches and natural thread flow without visible pixelation or irregular textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of embedding a writing panel with a knitted border inside an open book, this introduces a new composite element not present in the original. The book is located on the right side of the frame near the lamp. The writing panel must be integrated seamlessly into the open pages, with the knitted border matching the style and material of the surrounding fabric. Mismatches in lighting, shadow, or texture could break realism. Additionally, the panel’s placement must not obscure or distort the book’s structure.
Question: Is the writing panel positioned within the open book pages such that its edges align naturally with the page boundaries and the knitted border matches the texture and color of the surrounding fabric?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of soft lamplight illustration, the original image features a lamp on the right side emitting warm light. Adding or enhancing lamplight effects must preserve the existing lighting gradient and shadows. The new illumination should cast soft glows consistent with the source position, without creating harsh highlights or unnatural shadows that conflict with the ambient lighting. We check if the added light interacts realistically with nearby surfaces like the book, cup, and armchair.
Question: Does the added lamplight effect produce a gradual glow around the book and cup without creating unnatural bright spots or conflicting shadows on the armchair or wall?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
