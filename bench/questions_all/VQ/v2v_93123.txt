Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of maintaining the soft, warm illumination on both subjects while replacing the background, we need to assess if the lighting on the man and the pineapple remains consistent with the new background.
Question: Does the lighting on the man and the pineapple appear consistent with the new aged blackboard background, without introducing unnatural shadows or highlights?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement emphasizes avoiding artifacts and loss of details during the replacement of the background. We need to check if the transition between the subjects and the new background is seamless.
Question: Are there any visible artifacts or unnatural edges where the man and the pineapple meet the new aged blackboard background?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement focuses on structural coherence and visual plausibility. We need to evaluate if the new background elements like equations and sketches integrate well with the existing subjects.
Question: Do the chalk-written equations and galactic sketches on the new blackboard background integrate naturally with the man and the pineapple, maintaining structural coherence?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement ensures that the core elements retain their visual credibility. We need to confirm that the man and the pineapple maintain their original proportions and details.
Question: Have the proportions and details of the man and the pineapple been preserved, avoiding any distortion or loss of fine details?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement stresses the avoidance of introducing unnatural textures. We need to verify if the texture of the new blackboard background complements the existing elements.
Question: Does the texture of the new aged blackboard background complement the man and the pineapple, without introducing any unnatural or conflicting textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
