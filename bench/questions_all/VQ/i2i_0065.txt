Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the natural appearance and avoiding unnatural artifacts when adding a glass display case around the dog, assess if the glass and its reflections integrate naturally with the image's existing structure.
Question: Does the glass display case appear transparent and free of unnatural textures or distortions that would make it look artificial?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of preserving the dog's structural consistency and visual credibility while ensuring the lighting focuses on the face, evaluate if the lighting modification feels authentic.
Question: Is the light focused on the dog’s face well-integrated with the environment, without introducing noticeable shadows or highlights that disrupt the scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of retaining the core element's structural consistency and authenticity when reframing the image as a museum exhibit, assess whether the placement of the dog within the new setting looks plausible.
Question: Does the dog remain proportionally consistent within the new museum exhibit setup, avoiding any distortion or deformation in its physical structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of ensuring the overall authenticity and absence of obvious artifacts when adding an informational label about the breed and story, check if the label blends seamlessly into the image.
Question: Does the informational label about the breed and story appear naturally placed, with no jagged edges or abrupt transitions that suggest poor integration?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of ensuring the retained core element ensures structural consistency and visual credibility, verify if the dog’s detailed features, like fur texture and facial expressions, remain unaffected and lifelike even after modifications.
Question: Are the fine details of the dog, such as fur texture and facial expression, maintained with clarity and authenticity, without becoming overly smoothed or pixelated?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
