Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the chalets into crystalline ice castles with frosted spires and snowflake-patterned walls, evaluate whether the structural transformation of the two wooden chalets (located in the foreground and midground) maintains geometric coherence and visual credibility. The original chalets have defined gabled roofs, chimneys, and window placements; their conversion to ice structures must preserve plausible proportions and avoid distorted or broken shapes. This includes checking if the new crystalline forms retain architectural logic and do not introduce unnatural geometry such as warped angles or floating elements.
Question: Do the transformed chalets maintain consistent roof slopes and chimney placements without geometric distortion or floating components?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the snowy landscape with a shimmering expanse of glowing ice, assess whether the ground surface beneath and around the chalets has been uniformly converted to a translucent, luminous ice texture while preserving smooth gradients and natural flow. The original snow appears soft and undulating, so any replacement must avoid abrupt transitions, pixelation, or artificial glow artifacts that break realism.
Question: Is the glowing ice surface continuous across the slope and around the chalets without jagged edges, unnatural reflections, or inconsistent brightness patches?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of enhancing pine trees into towering ice sculptures with delicate icicle branches, evaluate whether the trees in the background and foreground (especially the large conifer to the right of the front chalet) have been realistically transformed. The conversion should preserve tree-like structure while introducing fine icicle details without clumping, unnatural branching patterns, or loss of depth perception.
Question: Do the ice-enhanced pine trees retain recognizable tree silhouettes with evenly distributed icicles and no fused or missing branches?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding swirling auroras above the scene, assess whether the aurora effect is integrated seamlessly into the sky region above the mountains and peaks. The original sky contains a bright sun and clear gradient from dark blue to light near the horizon; the auroras must not obscure celestial elements unnaturally or create disjointed light streaks that violate atmospheric perspective.
Question: Are the auroras positioned above the mountain range without overlapping the sun or creating unnatural light halos or disconnected streaks?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting chalet walls into snowflake-patterned surfaces, evaluate whether the intricate snowflake designs on the fa√ßades are evenly distributed and proportionally scaled relative to the building size. The patterns should not appear stretched, repeated in a grid-like manner, or clash with window placements, which could suggest texture mapping errors.
Question: Are the snowflake patterns on the chalet walls uniform in scale and orientation, and do they align naturally with the building's architecture without repeating or distorting at edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
