Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the instruction to transform the foreground baby elephant into a cartoon character while retaining its pose, ensuring the cartoon style is consistent with the reference of being rounded and cute, it's important that the transformation does not introduce unnatural artifacts or break the visual coherence of the image. To check this visually, observe the cartoon transformation of the baby elephant and assess if it retains proper proportions and texture consistency.
Question: Does the cartoon transformation of the baby elephant maintain natural proportions without any noticeable distortion or unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: The editing requires adding text "First Splash!" and "Ele-Baby" in a transparent background without affecting the clarity of the elements behind it.

Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4:

Question: Does the cartoon baby elephant retain its original pose accurately, maintaining structural coherence and visual credibility?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
