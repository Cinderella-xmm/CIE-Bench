Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction specifies creating a yoga-themed art print with a cartoonized serene figure performing a yoga pose. This involves stylizing the human figure while maintaining anatomical plausibility and graceful posture lines. The original image shows a woman in a complex yoga pose (Natarajasana variation) on a beach at sunset. The key elements to be edited include the figure’s proportions, facial expression, clothing texture, and overall style to achieve a cartoonized yet natural appearance. The background elements—beach, ocean, rocks, and sun—should retain visual harmony but be stylized to match the artistic theme. The instruction emphasizes calming earth tones, elongated lines, and tactile elegance in the final album design. Therefore, the sub requirements must address whether the stylization preserves structural coherence, avoids unnatural distortions, maintains plausible anatomy, and ensures material/textural consistency without introducing artifacts.

-Sub requirement 1: Stylize the human figure into a cartoonized form while preserving anatomical structure and proportion, ensuring that limbs, joints, and body alignment remain physically plausible despite exaggerated posture lines.

-Sub requirement 2: Modify the color palette to emphasize calming earth tones across the entire image (figure, clothing, background), ensuring consistent tonal harmony without abrupt or unnatural transitions.

-Sub requirement 3: Adjust the figure’s posture to feature elongated and gracefully exaggerated lines, verifying that such exaggeration does not result in broken geometric shapes, distorted limbs, or unnatural joint angles.

-Sub requirement 4: Maintain natural textures on the figure’s skin, clothing, and environmental elements (sand, water, rocks), avoiding pixelation, smearing, or artificial patterns introduced during stylization.

-Sub requirement 5: Ensure that the background elements (ocean waves, rocks, horizon, sun) are stylized cohesively with the figure, preserving spatial depth and perspective while avoiding floating objects or misaligned horizons.

-Sub requirement 6: Verify that the hands and feet of the figure maintain correct finger count (five per hand/foot), ergonomic shape, and natural positioning, especially in the pose where one hand grasps the foot and the other extends upward.

-Sub requirement 7: Confirm that the lighting and shadows are consistent with the setting sun position, casting soft, directional light across the figure and environment without conflicting highlights or dark patches.

-Sub requirement 8: Check for any visible artifacts such as jagged edges, ghosting, or blending errors around the figure’s silhouette, especially where limbs cross or interact with the background.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of stylizing the human figure into a cartoonized form while preserving anatomical structure, this question evaluates whether the limbs and joints maintain physical plausibility despite exaggerated posture lines. The figure's raised leg and bent arm forming a loop above the head must retain realistic bone alignment and muscle flow.
Question: Does the figure's raised leg and upper arm maintain continuous, smooth curvature without sharp breaks or disconnected segments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of modifying the color palette to calming earth tones, this question checks if the colors across the figure and environment transition smoothly and harmoniously, particularly in areas like the green top, black leggings, and golden sky.
Question: Are the colors of the figure's clothing and the surrounding environment (sky, sand, water) unified in tone, with no abrupt shifts or clashing hues?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of elongating posture lines without distorting geometry, this question assesses whether the figure’s spine, neck, and limbs follow natural biomechanics, even when stretched. The head tilt and arm extension should not suggest impossible flexibility or collapsed joints.
Question: Is the angle between the neck and torso consistent with human flexibility, and do the extended arms show smooth, uninterrupted lines without kinks or bends?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining natural textures, this question examines whether the surface details of the figure’s skin, fabric of the leggings, and sand appear coherent and free from artificial patterns or noise, especially in high-detail areas like the back and legs.
Question: Do the textures on the figure’s skin and clothing show consistent shading and fine detail without visible pixelation or smeared regions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of correct hand anatomy, this question evaluates the hand grasping the foot—specifically checking finger count, spacing, and grip realism. Each hand must have five fingers, properly curved and aligned with the foot.
Question: Does the hand holding the foot have exactly five fingers, each with natural curvature and proper contact with the foot, without overlapping or missing digits?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of consistent lighting, this question checks whether the shadow cast by the figure aligns with the sun’s position and intensity, and whether highlights on the skin and clothing follow the expected direction of light.
Question: Is the shadow beneath the figure aligned with the sun’s position in the sky and does it taper naturally toward the horizon?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q7: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts, this question focuses on the boundary between the figure and the background, especially where limbs intersect the sun or sea, to detect potential edge artifacts or transparency issues.
Question: Are there any visible halos, jagged edges, or blending errors along the outline of the figure, particularly around the raised leg and arm?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
