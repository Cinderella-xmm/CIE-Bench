      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reducing the Statue of Liberty in scale and enclosing it within a glass lantern, this question evaluates whether the statue's proportions remain accurate and undistorted after scaling down. Specifically, it checks if the head, torso, limbs, and torch maintain anatomical correctness and proper spatial relationships, avoiding elongation or compression that would suggest digital distortion.",
      "question": "Does the scaled-down Statue of Liberty retain correct proportions between its head, torso, arms, and legs without any visible stretching or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying verdigris and copper-hued patinas to the statue, this question assesses whether the surface textures appear natural and consistent with real metal oxidation. It focuses on the distribution of green and brown tones, presence of subtle weathering patterns, and absence of uniform or painted-on effects.",
      "question": "Are the green and copper hues on the statue’s surface distributed naturally with variations in tone and texture resembling real patina formation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a vintage glass lantern around the statue, this question evaluates whether the glass enclosure appears transparent and physically plausible. It checks for proper reflection and refraction effects, smooth edges, and absence of pixelation or ghosting artifacts that could indicate low-quality rendering.",
      "question": "Is the glass lantern transparent with visible reflections and refractions, and do its edges appear smooth without jagged lines or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the background with a pastel skyline, this question examines whether the sky gradient and distant buildings are smoothly rendered without sharp transitions or unnatural color blocks. It ensures the backdrop supports the diorama aesthetic without introducing visual noise or inconsistencies.",
      "question": "Is the pastel skyline composed of smooth color gradients and softly defined building silhouettes without abrupt color changes or banding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding tiny ships and waves beneath the statue, this question evaluates whether the maritime elements are proportionally correct and detailed enough to appear plausible. It checks if the ships have recognizable forms and the waves follow natural fluid dynamics, avoiding overly simplistic or repetitive patterns.",
      "question": "Are the ships and waves beneath the statue appropriately sized relative to the statue and do they exhibit natural shapes and wave patterns without repetition or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a revolving mechanism at the base, this question assesses whether the mechanical components (e.g., gears, rotating platform) are structurally coherent and logically placed. It checks for alignment with the base, absence of floating parts, and realistic integration with the lantern’s foundation.",
      "question": "Is the revolving mechanism at the base integrated seamlessly with the lantern’s structure, with all components properly aligned and grounded without floating or misaligned parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining consistent lighting and shadows across all elements, this question evaluates whether the light source creates unified illumination and shadow casting. It checks if the statue, lantern, ships, and waves are lit from the same direction, with soft shadows that match the time of day and environmental conditions.",
      "question": "Do all elements in the scene—including the statue, glass lantern, ships, and waves—cast shadows consistent with a single light source and show uniform lighting without conflicting highlights or dark spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
