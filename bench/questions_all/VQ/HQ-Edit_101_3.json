      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the bird into an illustrated emblem while maintaining its vibrant yellow color, evaluate whether the transformation from a photorealistic bird to an illustrated style preserves structural coherence and visual plausibility. The editing position is the bird located centrally on the branch, which must retain its core shape and proportions despite stylization. The question focuses on whether the illustration maintains natural-looking contours and avoids geometric distortions or unnatural simplifications.",
      "question": "Does the illustrated bird retain the original bird's body proportions and head-to-body ratio without exaggerated or distorted features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of surrounding the bird with cherry blossom motifs from the photo, assess whether the added floral elements are seamlessly integrated and consistent in style and scale with the original blossoms. The editing position includes the pink flowers near the bird and along the branches. The question checks for visual credibility in placement and natural appearance of the duplicated or extended floral patterns.",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossom motifs surrounding the bird evenly spaced and proportionally consistent with the original flowers in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying an elegant, minimalist typographic logo at the top, evaluate whether the text element appears cleanly rendered and properly aligned without disrupting the composition. The editing position is the upper portion of the image where the logo would be placed. The question ensures that the typography does not introduce visual artifacts such as jagged edges, misalignment, or unnatural contrast against the background.",
      "question": "Is the typographic logo positioned at the top of the image with smooth edges and uniform spacing, free from pixelation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying a soft pastel gradient background to enhance sophistication, assess whether the background transition blends naturally with the existing elements. The editing position is the entire background area behind the bird and blossoms. The question checks for abrupt transitions, color clashes, or unnatural gradients that could detract from the overall realism.",
      "question": "Does the pastel gradient background transition smoothly from one hue to another without visible banding or sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the bird’s vibrant yellow color in the illustrated form, evaluate whether the color remains consistent and true to the original without introducing unnatural saturation or texture anomalies. The editing position is the bird’s plumage, particularly the chest and wings. The question checks if the yellow hue is evenly distributed and retains fine feather details even after stylization.",
      "question": "Is the yellow color of the illustrated bird uniformly applied across its body without patches of over-saturation or loss of fine texture detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
