Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the sandy beach with a flat white studio background to highlight the product, evaluate whether the new background maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image features a natural beach scene with sand texture and ocean horizon; replacing it with a studio background must avoid visible seams or inconsistent lighting that could break realism. The transition between the toy and the new background should be seamless without artifacts.
Question: Is the white studio background uniformly flat and free of shadows, texture mismatches, or visible edges where it meets the toy?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a small brand logo tag stitched on the hippo’s ear with soft blue thread, assess whether the addition is physically plausible and visually consistent with the knitted texture of the plush toy. The stitching should follow the fabric's pattern and not appear as a floating or misaligned graphic.
Question: Is the logo tag on the hippo’s ear properly aligned with the knit texture, showing realistic thread stitching and no unnatural color or shape distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a circular embroidered brand patch on the hippo’s side, evaluate whether the patch integrates naturally into the plush material. The patch must match the knitting style and thickness of the toy, avoiding any floating or unrealistic depth cues that suggest poor integration.
Question: Does the circular patch on the hippo’s side have consistent knit texture and thickness with the surrounding fabric, without raised or detached appearance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of incorporating a packaging box with pastel wave motifs and seashell illustrations behind the toy, assess whether the box is positioned plausibly in space relative to the toy. It should not overlap incorrectly or cast inconsistent shadows, and its design must maintain visual credibility as a real-world product package.
Question: Is the packaging box positioned behind the toy at a natural distance, with consistent lighting and shadow alignment that matches the direction of light on the toy?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding transparent plastic window on the box front to showcase the toy inside, evaluate whether the window appears physically accurate—transparent but slightly reflective, with no distortions or blurring of the toy seen through it. The transparency should not introduce ghosting or chromatic aberration.
Question: Is the plastic window on the box front transparent with subtle reflections and no distortion of the toy’s image visible through it?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding text elements in rounded, child-friendly fonts reading 'Summer Pals Collection', assess whether the text is legible, proportionally sized, and stylistically consistent with the playful theme. It must not overlap with other elements unnaturally or appear pixelated.
Question: Are the text elements clearly visible, correctly spaced, and rendered with smooth edges without jaggedness or overlapping with other objects?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
