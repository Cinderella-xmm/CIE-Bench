      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the log walls into bark-covered limbs, this question evaluates whether the bark texture is applied naturally across the horizontal logs without introducing artificial seams, color mismatches, or unnatural warping. The original logs have consistent circular ends and smooth grain; any deviation would break perceptual authenticity.",
      "question": "Are the bark textures on the logs continuous and aligned with the original log shapes, showing no abrupt edges or inconsistent scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing windows with glowing amber eyes, this question checks if the eye shapes fit within the original window frames and whether the glow appears contained and physically plausible. The original window is rectangular and located on the left side of the cabin; any distortion or overflow would compromise realism.",
      "question": "Do the glowing amber eyes fit precisely within the original window openings without distorting the surrounding log structure or spreading light beyond the intended area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the roof into a leafy canopy extending upward, this question assesses whether the foliage follows the roof’s slope and extends realistically without floating or collapsing. The original roof has a steep gable; the canopy should grow upward from it without breaking structural logic.",
      "question": "Does the leafy canopy extend upward from the roof ridge in a natural, gravity-consistent manner, with leaves overlapping logically and not appearing suspended or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding vines and moss, this question evaluates whether these elements grow along logical paths—such as from ground up logs or over eaves—and whether their textures blend with the wood and bark. Vines should curve naturally, not appear as flat stickers.",
      "question": "Are the vines and moss growing along the logs and roofline in a way that follows natural climbing patterns, with no flat, disconnected patches or unnatural straight lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of carving mystical runes along the logs, this question checks if the runes are embedded into the log surface with appropriate depth and continuity, matching the curvature of the logs and not appearing as overlaid graphics.",
      "question": "Are the runes carved into the logs with consistent depth and alignment, following the roundness of the logs and not appearing as flat or misaligned symbols?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing garage doors with animated forest spirit faces, this question evaluates whether the facial features are proportionally correct within the door openings and whether the emerald energy trails emerge naturally from the face without breaking physical continuity.",
      "question": "Are the forest spirit faces positioned within the original garage door frames, with facial features properly scaled and energy trails flowing outward in a smooth, non-jagged manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence, this question checks for any floating, misaligned, or broken parts in the transformed structure—especially at joints between logs, roof, and base—to ensure the building remains visually stable and credible.",
      "question": "Are all structural components (logs, roof, canopy, vines, faces) connected seamlessly without gaps, floating elements, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
