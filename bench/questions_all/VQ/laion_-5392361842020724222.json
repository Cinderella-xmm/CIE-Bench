      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the kneeling figure’s robe into gilded brocade, this involves changing the material of the pink garment to a metallic, patterned textile. The question evaluates whether the new texture appears natural with visible weave patterns, appropriate light reflection, and seamless integration with the existing fold lines and shadows. It checks for artificial glossiness, pixelation, or misalignment at seam edges.",
      "question": "Does the gilded brocade texture on the kneeling figure's robe show consistent metallic sheen and intricate pattern details without unnatural highlights or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the standing figure’s cloak with richly draped velvet, this involves altering the material properties and volumetric behavior of the brown outer garment. The evaluation focuses on whether the new velvet maintains realistic softness, depth in folds, and shadow gradation, avoiding flatness or exaggerated creases that break physical plausibility.",
      "question": "Is the velvet texture on the standing figure's cloak rendered with natural depth, soft shading, and smooth transitions between folds without abrupt edges or unnatural compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adorning the infant with ornate silver swaddling, this involves adding a metallic element around the baby’s body. The evaluation checks whether the silver wrapping conforms to the infant’s form, displays realistic reflections, and avoids overlapping incorrectly or creating floating fragments. It also ensures that skin details beneath remain visible where appropriate.",
      "question": "Are the silver swaddling bands wrapped around the infant’s body correctly aligned with anatomical contours and free from gaps, overlaps, or misplaced reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a detailed architectural setting with classical columns and divine motifs, this involves placing new environmental elements behind and around the figures. The evaluation examines whether these structures are proportionally scaled, properly positioned in depth, and lit consistently with the rest of the scene. It checks for incorrect perspective, mismatched vanishing points, or visual disconnection between figures and background.",
      "question": "Do the classical columns and divine motifs in the background align with the figures' scale and perspective, showing correct foreshortening and shadow direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving the original poses and proportions of all figures, this involves ensuring that limbs, hands, and facial features remain anatomically accurate after material and style changes. Specifically, the hands of both Mary and Joseph should have five fingers each, natural joint angles, and unbroken outlines. The infant’s limbs should not appear stretched or compressed.",
      "question": "Do the hands of the kneeling and standing figures display five fingers each with natural curvature, unbroken lines, and no extra digits or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining halo integrity, this involves verifying that the golden rings above both Mary and Joseph remain perfectly circular, uniformly thick, and positioned directly above their heads without intersecting hair or clothing. Any warping or partial clipping would indicate rendering issues.",
      "question": "Are the golden halos above both figures complete circles, evenly spaced from the head, and free from deformation or clipping into hair or garments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the overall composition into a Renaissance fresco style, this involves assessing the artistic technique applied across the entire image. The evaluation checks for simulated brushstrokes, aged pigment effects, and harmonious color grading typical of frescoes. It also looks for absence of sharp digital edges or modern rendering artifacts.",
      "question": "Does the entire scene exhibit a uniform fresco-like texture with subtle brushstroke patterns and muted tones, without visible digital seams or overly sharp contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
