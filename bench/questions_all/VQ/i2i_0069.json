      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding a sci-fi style holographic projection screen emerging from the phone while ensuring overall authenticity and natural appearance,\" we need to assess if the new element blends well with the existing image context. This involves examining if the addition introduces unnatural textures or breaks structural coherence.",
      "question": "Does the holographic projection screen emerge naturally from the phone without disrupting the visual flow of the image?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Considering the sub requirement to maintain structural consistency and visual credibility, especially around the interplay between the hologram and the original sandwich image, we must evaluate the absence of distortions and unnatural color gradients.",
      "question": "Are there any noticeable artifacts or unnatural colors where the holographic screen connects with the phone?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "To ensure that the added holographic screen maintains a realistic appearance, it’s important to evaluate its proportions relative to the sandwich and its environment, ensuring it doesn’t look misplaced or oversized.",
      "question": "Do the dimensions of the holographic projection screen match the scale of the surrounding objects in the image?",
      "choices": [

      "thinking_process": "Addressing the sub requirement to retain the core element’s structural consistency, we need to verify that the sandwich remains visually intact and unchanged apart from the necessary edits.",
      "question": "Has the overall texture and detail of the sandwich been preserved despite the addition of the holographic screen?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Given the importance of avoiding the introduction of unnatural textures and maintaining visual plausibility, an assessment of the visual integrity of the background elements after the edit is crucial.",
      "question": "Does the background remain consistent and undistorted by the addition of the holographic projection screen?",
