Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "bold graphic lines delineating the cat's shape", evaluate whether the outline of the cat has been transformed into sharp, clean, and consistent graphic lines without blurring or jagged edges, ensuring structural coherence and visual plausibility in the pop art style. The original image shows a soft-edged, realistic cat; thus, the transformation must preserve its form while introducing stylized outlines.
Question: Are the edges of the cat’s body defined by clear, continuous, and uniform bold lines that follow its natural silhouette without distortion or gaps?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "sunglasses rendered in vibrant, flat orange", assess whether the sunglasses have been replaced with a solid, uniform orange color without gradients or texture, maintaining flatness as per pop art conventions. In the original image, the sunglasses reflect the environment with realistic lens effects; this must be simplified to a flat color.
Question: Is the color of the sunglasses uniformly flat orange without any reflection, gradient, or texture, and does it maintain the original shape and position on the cat’s face?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "beach background simplified into abstract color blocks", evaluate whether the sky, ocean, and sand have been replaced with large, distinct, non-graduated color areas (e.g., blocky blues, yellows, pinks) instead of realistic textures and lighting. The original image features smooth gradients and wave details; these must be abstracted.
Question: Has the beach background been converted into solid, non-blended color blocks for the sky, ocean, and sand, with no visible texture or natural gradient transitions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "harness and shadows replaced with gradient fills", assess whether the harness around the cat’s neck has been replaced with a smooth gradient rather than its original fabric texture, and whether shadows beneath the cat are now filled with gradient colors instead of natural shading. The original harness is detailed and textured; shadows are soft and physically plausible.
Question: Is the harness depicted using a smooth gradient fill instead of realistic fabric texture, and are the shadows under the cat composed of gradient colors rather than natural light-based shading?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "employ all primary colors for high contrast and visual impact", evaluate whether the entire image uses only primary colors (red, blue, yellow) in bold, saturated forms across all elements—cat, sunglasses, hot dog, background—without secondary or tertiary hues. The original image contains many intermediate tones; the edit must enforce strict primary color usage.
Question: Are all major elements in the image—including the cat, sunglasses, hot dog, and background—rendered exclusively in red, blue, or yellow, with no other colors present?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
