Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the musician into a renowned jazz artist from the 1920s, including changing the beret to a classic fedora, this involves replacing the headwear. The original image shows a black beret with a small feather-like detail on top. The editing requires removing the beret and replacing it with a fedora, which must maintain consistent lighting, shadowing, and material texture relative to the rest of the face and clothing. This change affects facial proportions and overall realism if not aligned properly.
Question: Does the fedora hat sit naturally on the man's head without visible misalignment, unnatural shadows, or clipping artifacts at the edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of updating the musician’s attire to include a vintage suit and snazzy bowtie, the original image shows a brown textured jacket over a blue shirt. The editing requires adding a bowtie and potentially modifying the jacket style to reflect 1920s fashion. This includes ensuring the fabric texture, folds, and color harmony match the rest of the outfit and environment.
Question: Is the bowtie positioned correctly under the collar, with natural fabric folds and no floating or distorted edges, and does it match the era-appropriate design?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of changing the background to a lively speakeasy with art deco elements, the original image features a dimly lit bar with hanging lamps, brick walls, and blurred patrons. The editing requires replacing these elements with bold geometric patterns on the walls, art deco lighting fixtures, and patrons in flapper attire. This transformation must preserve depth, perspective, and lighting consistency.
Question: Are the wall decorations in the background composed of clear geometric patterns typical of art deco design, with proper alignment and no texture repetition or warping?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of updating the patrons’ attire to flapper-style clothing, the original image shows people in modern casual wear. The editing requires modifying their clothing to reflect 1920s fashion—such as fringed dresses, cloche hats, and tailored suits. These changes must respect body proportions and avoid distortions in limbs or clothing seams.
Question: Do the figures in the background wear clothing consistent with 1920s fashion, with correct proportions, no overlapping or missing limbs, and natural fabric draping?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility, particularly around the hands holding the saxophone, the original image shows two hands gripping the instrument with realistic finger placement. The editing should preserve anatomical accuracy—five fingers per hand, natural joint angles, and skin texture—while integrating the new context.
Question: Do both hands holding the saxophone have exactly five fingers each, with natural positioning, visible knuckles, and no deformation or extra digits?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
