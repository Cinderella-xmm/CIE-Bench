      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the top candle holders with tapered glass perfume caps, evaluate whether the material transition from metal to glass is visually plausible. The new caps should exhibit natural transparency, internal reflections, and proper refraction, and their shape should taper smoothly without geometric distortions.",
      "question": "Do the top portions of the candelabra now appear as transparent, tapered glass caps with realistic light behavior and smooth contours?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the metal stems with gold-finish tubing, assess whether the new tubing appears seamless and continuous, especially at junctions between arms and the central shaft. The gold finish should reflect light uniformly and not show discontinuities or digital artifacts.",
      "question": "Are the arms and central shaft replaced with smooth, uninterrupted gold-finish tubing that reflects light consistently and lacks visible seams or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of embossing a minimalist brand logo on the base, check whether the logo is integrated into the surface without disrupting the existing beaded edge or causing unnatural depressions or highlights. The logo should appear as part of the original structure.",
      "question": "Is the brand logo embossed on the base such that it blends naturally with the surrounding texture and does not introduce irregular depth or lighting anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of overlaying floral-engraved patterns across the surface, evaluate whether the patterns follow the object's curves and maintain consistent line quality and depth. They should not appear flat, duplicated, or misaligned.",
      "question": "Are the floral-engraved patterns evenly distributed, following the contours of the candelabra without flattening, repeating unnaturally, or appearing as surface overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing a script font label on the central tube, verify that the text wraps correctly around the cylindrical surface, remains legible, and does not stretch or distort. It should not overlap with engraved patterns or appear as a separate layer.",
      "question": "Does the script font label on the central tube follow the curvature of the tube naturally, without warping, stretching, or overlapping with other surface details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
