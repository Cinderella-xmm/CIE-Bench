The question assesses whether the new background features coherent geometry, proper perspective, and realistic material textures.",
      "question": "Does the background feature a cobblestone ground with consistent stone size and spacing, and does it include architectural elements like arches or columns that align properly with perspective and scale?",

The question checks whether the texture is uniformly applied without disrupting fine details or creating artificial brushstroke effects.",

The question ensures the number of fingers, joint angles, and skin texture are natural and unaltered by editing.",
      "question": "Do the hands of the central figure show five fingers per hand with natural knuckle definition, skin texture, and positioning consistent with human anatomy, without extra digits or unnatural bending?",
