Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the girl into a paper-cut style with intricate lace detailing on her blouse, this involves altering the texture and material appearance of the blouse. The original image shows a soft white blouse with delicate lace at the cuffs and collar. The editing instruction specifies adding or enhancing lace details in a paper-cut art style. This change affects the perceived realism and natural appearance of the fabric, especially in terms of texture consistency and material coherence. The question evaluates whether the lace detailing introduced maintains visual credibility and avoids unnatural textures such as overly sharp edges or inconsistent patterns that contradict real-world textile properties.
Question: Are the lace details on the blouse rendered with consistent texture and edge definition, avoiding jagged or artificial-looking patterns that break from realistic fabric behavior?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: The instruction requires enlarging the violin to emphasize musical expression. In the original image, the violin is proportionally sized relative to the girl’s body. Enlarging it introduces a risk of geometric distortion—such as stretched wood grain, misaligned f-holes, or warped scroll shape—which could compromise structural coherence. The question checks whether the enlarged violin retains accurate proportions and anatomical features typical of a real violin, ensuring physical plausibility and absence of deformation.
Question: Does the enlarged violin maintain correct proportions and undistorted structural elements such as the scroll, bridge, and f-holes, without visible warping or stretching?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: The editing instruction calls for refining the girl’s pose to emphasize musical expression. In the original image, she holds the violin in a natural playing position with proper hand alignment and arm posture. Any refinement must preserve anatomical accuracy—particularly in the positioning of fingers on the fingerboard and bow grip. Altering the pose risks introducing unnatural joint angles, incorrect number of fingers, or awkward hand shapes that violate ergonomic principles. This question assesses the structural integrity and visual credibility of the hands and arms during the posed action.
Question: Are the fingers on both hands correctly positioned and shaped, with no extra digits or distorted joints, maintaining natural human anatomy?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The instruction specifies printing the final image on textured cream stock with postcard backs featuring blank music sheet motifs. While this refers to the output medium and layout, it also implies a shift in overall visual style—from a photorealistic rendering to an artistic, stylized representation resembling a physical postcard. The transition should not introduce artifacts like unnatural lighting, false shadows, or inconsistent surface textures. The question evaluates whether the entire composition preserves a cohesive visual tone and avoids abrupt stylistic breaks or digital imperfections that would suggest poor integration of the paper-cut aesthetic.
Question: Is the overall surface texture consistent across the image, with no mismatched areas showing sudden changes in lighting, gloss, or material quality that suggest poor layer blending?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The instruction includes adding blank music sheet motifs on the back of the postcard. Although this element is not visible in the front-facing view, its presence affects the perceived authenticity of the final product. If the front image contains elements (e.g., background objects) that conflict with the implied physicality of a printed postcard—such as floating objects or inconsistent depth—it undermines visual credibility. The question ensures that the foreground elements (girl, violin, table) remain spatially coherent and grounded within a plausible two-dimensional plane consistent with a postcard format.
Question: Do all foreground elements (girl, violin, table, candlestick) maintain consistent depth and placement, avoiding floating or misplaced components that disrupt spatial logic?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
