      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the facial features and skin texture to achieve a semi-cartoon style while maintaining natural aging cues, this question evaluates whether the facial structure retains anatomical accuracy and realistic skin texture despite stylization. The focus is on whether wrinkles, eye shape, and mouth contours are preserved without unnatural flattening or exaggeration that would compromise visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and skin texture on the elder’s face naturally rendered without excessive smoothing or artificial cartoon-like distortion?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enhancing floral motifs on the hanbok and background with pastel colors, this question assesses whether the floral patterns appear seamlessly integrated into the fabric and environment without repeating, blurred, or mismatched textures. The evaluation focuses on the continuity and clarity of the floral designs across the garment and background.",
      "question": "Do the floral patterns on the hanbok and surrounding foliage display consistent detail and alignment without visible repetition or blurring?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adjusting the hanbok’s gradient color for vibrancy, this question checks whether the color transitions across the fabric follow a smooth, physically plausible gradient without abrupt shifts or unnatural banding. It also evaluates whether the transparency and layering of the fabric remain coherent with light interaction.",
      "question": "Is the gradient transition across the hanbok's fabric smooth and continuous, with no sharp color breaks or unnatural banding effects?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding green vine accents and floral decorations in the background, this question examines whether these elements are spatially coherent and properly layered with respect to depth and occlusion. It ensures that vines do not float unnaturally or intersect incorrectly with other objects.",
      "question": "Are the green vine accents positioned behind the subject and aligned with the depth of the background, without appearing to float above or through solid structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of introducing a floral-decorated envelope frame, this question evaluates whether the envelope is visually consistent with the artwork—meaning its edges are clean, shadows are soft and appropriate, and the floral decoration matches the style and scale of the rest of the image. It checks for misalignment or clipping artifacts.",
      "question": "Is the envelope frame fully aligned with the image boundaries, with no jagged edges, clipping errors, or mismatched shadowing?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts such as jagged edges or ghosting, this question focuses on high-detail areas like hair strands, fabric folds, and flower petals. It checks for digital artifacts that might suggest low-resolution rendering or poor anti-aliasing.",
      "question": "Are the edges of the hair, fabric folds, and floral elements sharp and clean without jagged lines, pixelation, or ghosting artifacts?",
