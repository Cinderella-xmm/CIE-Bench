      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the aircraft into a stylized 3D model encased in a vintage aviator's glass display case, evaluate whether the addition of the display case affects the overall realism and natural appearance. The editing involves introducing a new structure (glass case) around the original aircraft, which must maintain structural coherence with the aircraftâ€™s shape and proportions. The glass case should not distort or obscure key features of the aircraft, such as wings, propellers, or fuselage. Attention is required to ensure that the glass surface appears transparent and reflective without unnatural refraction or texture artifacts.",
      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the aircraft have smooth, clear surfaces without visible distortion, scratches, or unnatural reflections?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding worn leather accents and brass corners to the display case, assess whether these materials are rendered with realistic textures and appropriate physical properties. Leather should show subtle wear patterns, grain, and soft shading, while brass should exhibit metallic sheen and patina consistent with aged metal. These elements must be positioned correctly on the edges of the case and not appear floating or misaligned.",
      "question": "Are the leather accents and brass corners attached to the display case with accurate material textures, proper lighting response, and no visible seams or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of engraving an emblem on the front of the display case, evaluate whether the engraved detail is sharp, legible, and physically plausible. The emblem should integrate naturally into the surface of the case without appearing painted on or overly sharp compared to surrounding materials. It should conform to depth and shadowing consistent with actual engraving.",
      "question": "Is the engraved emblem on the front of the display case clearly defined with appropriate depth and shadowing, and does it blend naturally into the glass surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of including miniature clouds inside the display case for depth, assess whether the clouds appear suspended within the glass volume and do not interfere with the visibility of the aircraft. They should be rendered with soft edges and translucent qualities typical of clouds, and their placement should not violate spatial logic (e.g., overlapping the aircraft improperly or appearing outside the case).",
      "question": "Are the miniature clouds positioned inside the glass case, visually separated from the aircraft, and rendered with soft, volumetric textures without clipping or unnatural transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of positioning the plane diagonally upward for dynamism and integrating tiny spinning propellers to evoke flight, evaluate whether the aircraft maintains its structural integrity and correct orientation within the case. The diagonal angle should be consistent with the perspective of the scene, and the propellers must show motion blur or rotation cues without deforming the blades or creating visual inconsistencies such as overlapping or broken geometry.",
      "question": "Are the propellers depicted with rotational motion blur and properly aligned with the engine nacelles, without deformation or clipping against the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
