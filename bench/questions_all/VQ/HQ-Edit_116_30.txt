Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the cathedral into a detailed wooden model displayed inside an ornate shadow box, evaluate whether the material transformation from stone to warm stained wood maintains natural texture and visual coherence. The original image shows a gothic cathedral with intricate stonework, so the transition to wood must preserve fine details such as carvings and structural elements without introducing unnatural grain patterns or inconsistent lighting.
Question: Does the entire cathedral structure appear uniformly rendered in warm stained wood with consistent grain patterns and realistic wood textures across all surfaces, including spires, arches, and tracery?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of displaying the model within an ornate shadow box, assess whether the framing element is seamlessly integrated around the cathedral model. The original image features a large open plaza and sky background; replacing this with a shadow box requires evaluating if the edges of the box are properly aligned, proportionally scaled, and visually plausible without distortion or floating elements.
Question: Are the edges of the shadow box clearly defined, structurally coherent, and proportionally sized relative to the cathedral model, with no visible gaps, misalignments, or floating components?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding tiny pews and chandeliers inside the miniature model, evaluate whether these small-scale objects are accurately placed within the interior space of the cathedral. The original image shows a large, open fa√ßade with no visible interior details, so inserting internal elements must maintain correct scale, perspective, and spatial logic without appearing oversized or misplaced.
Question: Are the tiny pews and chandeliers positioned correctly within the interior of the cathedral model, maintaining proper scale and alignment with architectural features like columns and vaults, and do they cast consistent shadows?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a clock mechanism at the back that moves small figures along a path, assess whether the mechanical component appears physically plausible and integrated into the rear wall of the model. This involves checking for realistic gear shapes, consistent material appearance (e.g., metal vs. wood), and whether the moving figures follow a logical path without breaking geometric or physical rules.
Question: Is the clock mechanism located at the back of the model, featuring visible gears and a moving path for small figures, with no distorted shapes, inconsistent materials, or implausible motion trajectories?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of highlighting intricate gothic carvings in miniature form through 3D modeling, evaluate whether the fine details such as tracery, rose windows, and statues retain clarity and depth when scaled down. The original image contains highly detailed stonework; in the edited version, these must remain sharp and structurally accurate without blurring, smoothing, or loss of definition due to downsampling or rendering artifacts.
Question: Do the intricate gothic carvings, including the rose window, flying buttresses, and sculptural elements, retain sharp detail and accurate geometry in the miniature model without visible blurring, pixelation, or deformation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
