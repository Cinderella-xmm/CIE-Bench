      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a velvet-lined case around the key, this question evaluates whether the texture and appearance of the velvet material on the box are natural and consistent with real fabric, avoiding artificial patterns, incorrect lighting reflections, or mismatched shadows. The focus is on the surface properties and how they interact with light.",
      "question": "Does the velvet lining inside the box display a soft, matte texture with subtle pile variation and appropriate shadowing beneath the key, indicating realistic fabric behavior?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating gold scrollwork on the lid that mimics the key’s design, this question checks whether the scrollwork maintains geometric integrity and stylistic continuity with the original key’s ornamental pattern, ensuring no broken lines, misplaced curves, or inconsistent thicknesses.",
      "question": "Are the gold scrollwork patterns on the lid continuous, symmetrical, and proportionally similar to the decorative elements on the key’s bow, without any jagged edges or missing segments?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the key in a satin compartment, this question examines whether the satin material appears smooth and reflective in a way consistent with real silk, and whether the key rests naturally within the compartment without floating or unnatural spacing.",
      "question": "Is the satin compartment visibly smooth with soft highlights and gentle folds, and does the key sit flush within it without gaps or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding gold embossing of “Eternal Elegance,” this question assesses whether the embossed text has consistent depth, sharp letterforms, and metallic sheen matching the key and lid’s gold finish, avoiding blur or misalignment.",
      "question": "Is the embossed text “Eternal Elegance” clearly legible, evenly raised, and rendered with a metallic luster that matches the gold tone and reflectivity of the key and scrollwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the original key’s structure and details, this question verifies that the key itself has not been altered, distorted, or degraded in resolution during the integration into the new scene, ensuring all fine details like filigree, ball accents, and shaft grooves remain intact.",
      "question": "Are all ornamental details of the key — including the bow’s loops, bead-like protrusions, and shaft ridges — fully preserved and sharply defined without blurring, warping, or pixelation?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
