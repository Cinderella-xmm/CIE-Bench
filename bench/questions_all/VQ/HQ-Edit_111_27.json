      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the geisha into an Art Nouveau stained glass masterpiece, evaluate whether the overall style conversion maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. Specifically, assess if the transition from a realistic depiction to a stained glass aesthetic preserves natural proportions and avoids distortions in facial features or body structure.",
      "question": "Does the geisha's face retain anatomical accuracy with natural proportions and smooth contours despite the stained glass transformation?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of redesigning the kimono with flowing organic motifs and vivid jewel tones, evaluate whether the new patterned design adheres to the expected visual logic of stained glass art—such as defined lead lines, color separation, and absence of blended textures that contradict the medium.",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the kimono composed of distinct, sharp segments resembling leaded glass, with no blurred edges or unnatural blending between colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting cherry blossoms into intricate glass petals, evaluate whether the floral elements maintain botanical realism while being stylized as stained glass. Check for consistent texture, symmetry, and material coherence across all blossom clusters.",
      "question": "Do the cherry blossoms exhibit uniform glass-like textures with clear outlines and internal color gradations typical of stained glass, without appearing mushy or pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the fan into a peacock fan with iridescent feathers, assess whether the new fan retains functional shape and plausible feather arrangement, avoiding unnatural curvature or missing structural elements like ribs or joints.",
      "question": "Does the peacock fan have a logical number of feather segments arranged symmetrically around a central spine, with no overlapping or misaligned parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the background into a mosaic of curving lines and shades characteristic of Art Nouveau, evaluate whether the geometric layout follows coherent design principles—such as continuous flow, balanced curves, and absence of broken or jagged lines.",
      "question": "Are the background lines smoothly curved and interconnected without abrupt breaks, gaps, or inconsistent thicknesses that suggest rendering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining physical rationality in hand representation during the transformation, assess whether the hand holding the fan has five fingers with natural spacing, joint alignment, and skin texture consistent with the stained glass style but not distorted.",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the fan display five clearly defined fingers with proper ergonomics and no extra digits or fused joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
