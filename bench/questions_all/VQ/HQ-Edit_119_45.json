      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing traditional materials with brass and polished copper across the headdress and face, this question evaluates whether the new metallic textures appear consistent and natural, particularly in high-detail areas like the stripes of the nemes headdress and facial surface. The goal is to ensure there are no unnatural reflections, inconsistent shading, or texture artifacts introduced during material substitution.",
      "question": "Are the brass and copper textures on the headdress and face uniformly smooth and reflective, without visible noise, patchy areas, or abrupt transitions between adjacent segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the original geometric shape of the nemes headdress while adding mechanical elements, this question checks for structural integrity and dimensional accuracy. The striped pattern must remain aligned and undistorted even after integration of gears and copper components.",
      "question": "Do the vertical and horizontal stripes of the nemes headdress retain their original alignment and spacing, with no bending, stretching, or misalignment caused by the addition of mechanical parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding mechanical wings with emerald accents, this question assesses whether the wings are physically plausible, properly positioned, and stylistically consistent with the rest of the sculpture. Their placement should not interfere with the head or shoulders, and their design should follow logical mechanical construction.",
      "question": "Are the mechanical wings symmetrically placed on either side of the head or shoulders, with clean edges, defined joints, and emerald accents that do not appear floating or disconnected from the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of redesigning the collar with clockwork patterns and steam exhaust pipes, this question evaluates whether the added mechanical elements are logically arranged, visually cohesive, and free from clashing with existing features. The pipes must appear functional and integrated into the design.",
      "question": "Are the clockwork designs on the collar clearly defined and evenly spaced, with steam exhaust pipes attached at plausible locations and angles, and no overlapping or clipping with surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding subtle vapor near the steam exhaust pipes, this question examines whether the vapor effect is rendered realistically, with soft edges and proper transparency, rather than appearing as artificial or blocky overlays.",
      "question": "Is the vapor emerging from the steam exhaust pipes translucent and softly diffused, with no sharp edges, pixelation, or unnatural clustering that suggests digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving facial proportions despite material change, this question ensures that the facial features—eyes, nose, lips—remain anatomically accurate and undistorted, even when covered in mechanical details or replaced with non-traditional materials.",
      "question": "Are the eyes, nose, and mouth proportionally aligned and anatomically correct, with no warping, elongation, or asymmetry caused by the integration of gears or other mechanical elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
