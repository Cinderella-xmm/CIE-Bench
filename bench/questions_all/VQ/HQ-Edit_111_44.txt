Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the central figure into a regal African queen with intricate golden embroidery and elaborate beadwork, evaluate whether the added elements on her attire (such as embroidery and beadwork) maintain natural texture and material consistency with the surrounding clothing. Specifically, check if the gold embroidery appears metallic and detailed without unnatural sheen or pixelation, and if the beads are uniformly shaped and properly shaded to reflect light realistically.
Question: Are the golden embroidery patterns on the central figure's dress consistent in texture and detail, showing no signs of artificial edges or repetitive digital artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of enhancing the central figure’s headwear with elaborate beadwork, assess whether the beads on her headdress are physically plausible—specifically, whether they are evenly spaced, appropriately sized relative to the head, and cast realistic shadows. Check for any floating or misaligned beads that would suggest digital manipulation errors.
Question: Do the beads on the central figure’s headdress appear securely attached and proportionally scaled, with no floating or incorrectly positioned elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of depicting the central figure standing in a grand marketplace with vibrant textiles around, verify whether the surrounding market stalls and goods (e.g., baskets, produce) retain structural coherence and visual plausibility. Evaluate if the placement of items like fruits and grains follows natural stacking logic and if textures such as woven baskets appear consistent and undistorted.
Question: Are the baskets and produce in the foreground arranged naturally, with no visible geometric distortions or unnatural overlaps between objects?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding historical symbols to market goods to reflect cultural richness, determine whether these symbols (e.g., carvings, patterns on containers) are seamlessly integrated into the existing objects without disrupting their surface geometry. Check for any abrupt color shifts or texture breaks where symbols were applied.
Question: Are the historical symbols on the market goods (such as pottery or cloth) smoothly integrated into the surfaces, without visible seams or unnatural textural discontinuities?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of ensuring the central figure’s hands remain anatomically correct during transformation, examine whether the hands show five fingers with natural joint curvature and skin texture. Assess if the bracelets and rings are proportionally sized and do not cause deformation of the hand structure.
Question: Do the central figure’s hands have five fingers each, with natural finger alignment and skin texture, and are the multiple bracelets and rings positioned without distorting the hand shape?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
