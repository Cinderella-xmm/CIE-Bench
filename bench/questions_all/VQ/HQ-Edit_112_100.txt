Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a glass dome display around the eagle, evaluate whether the dome's transparency, curvature, and reflections are consistent with real glass material properties. The dome must not introduce unnatural distortions or artifacts in the eagle’s shape or background clouds due to refraction or reflection errors. The positioning of the dome must preserve the spatial relationship between the eagle and surrounding sky elements.
Question: Does the glass dome surrounding the eagle exhibit natural transparency, smooth curvature, and realistic light refraction without distorting the eagle or background clouds?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of including swirling miniature clouds under the eagle’s wings, assess whether these clouds maintain plausible cloud-like texture, volume, and lighting consistency with the ambient environment. They should not appear flat, pixelated, or unnaturally attached to the wings, and must align with the direction and scale of motion implied by the eagle’s flight.
Question: Are the miniature clouds beneath the eagle’s wings three-dimensional, properly lit, and textured to match natural cloud formations without appearing artificial or misaligned?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of accenting the miniature clouds with gold leaf, evaluate whether the gold leaf application appears as thin, reflective metallic flakes that integrate naturally into the cloud structure without clumping, unnatural shine, or breaking the illusion of soft cloud material. It should enhance elegance without compromising realism.
Question: Is the gold leaf detail on the miniature clouds applied in a way that shows fine, reflective metallic texture without disrupting the cloud’s natural appearance or creating harsh highlights?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of crafting a polished dark wood base engraved with "Noble Sky Guardian", assess whether the base has realistic wood grain, consistent polish, and legible engraving. The base must be proportionally scaled relative to the eagle and dome, and its placement must support the entire structure without visual imbalance or floating appearance.
Question: Does the dark wood base have natural wood texture, proper polish finish, and clearly engraved text, and is it positioned stably beneath the dome without appearing disconnected or disproportionately sized?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding small brass compass roses around the dome, evaluate whether each compass rose has accurate geometric shape, metallic sheen, and appropriate size relative to the dome and base. They must not appear distorted, duplicated, or placed in physically implausible locations (e.g., floating mid-air).
Question: Are the brass compass roses evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and rendered with realistic metallic texture and scale relative to the dome and base?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
