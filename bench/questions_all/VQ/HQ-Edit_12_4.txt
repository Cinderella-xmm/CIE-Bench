Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the pocket watch and fabric into a miniature tableau inside a glass dome, evaluate whether the addition of the glass dome affects the overall realism and natural appearance. The glass dome must appear transparent, refractive, and physically plausible, with no unnatural distortions or artifacts around its edges. The dome should not alter the proportions or geometry of the watch or fabric beneath it.
Question: Does the glass dome enclosing the pocket watch and fabric exhibit clear, smooth transparency with realistic light refraction and reflection, without visible distortion or jagged edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of embedding the watch within a 3D antique library scene, assess whether the added elements such as tiny leather-bound books and a quill are proportionally consistent with the scale of the pocket watch and fabric. These objects must be positioned in a way that maintains spatial coherence and physical plausibility, avoiding floating or misaligned elements.
Question: Are the miniature leather-bound books and quill placed around the watch at a consistent scale relative to the pocket watch and fabric, and do they rest naturally on the surface without appearing suspended or distorted?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using earthy, vibrant tones for books and cloth, and adding intricate golden embroidery on the fabric, evaluate whether the color palette of the newly introduced books matches the described earthy and vibrant tones. Also, check if the golden embroidery is detailed, continuous, and integrated seamlessly into the fabric texture without pixelation or unnatural highlights.
Question: Do the leather-bound books display earthy and vibrant colors (such as deep browns, ochres, or burgundies) that harmonize with the original fabric tone, and is the golden embroidery on the fabric continuous, finely detailed, and free of artificial shine or broken lines?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence and visual credibility when embedding elements into a 3D scene, evaluate whether the pocket watch retains its original shape, metallic sheen, and fine engravings. Any alteration to the watch’s structure—such as flattened surfaces, missing details, or inconsistent lighting—would compromise authenticity.
Question: Is the pocket watch preserved with intact geometric form, visible engraved patterns, and consistent metallic reflections, showing no deformation or loss of fine detail due to integration into the new scene?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of ensuring no obvious artifacts such as unnatural textures or degraded fine details, evaluate whether the fabric beneath the watch shows any signs of texture degradation, blurring, or repetition. The embroidered floral patterns should remain sharp and coherent across the entire surface, especially near the edges where the glass dome may cause subtle distortion.
Question: Is the texture of the maroon fabric with red and gold embroidery consistently sharp and unbroken throughout, including under and around the glass dome, with no blurred areas, repeating patterns, or unnatural smoothing?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
