Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of "replacing the forest background with a city balcony railing while maintaining the bird and its branch", assess if the transition between the bird, branch, and new cityscape background is seamless and free of visible artifacts.
Question: Are there any unnatural textures or visible edges where the forest background was replaced with the city balcony and skyline?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: No

Q2: 
Thinking process: Extracting from the sub requirement of "maintaining the structural coherence and visual plausibility of the image while adding urban elements", evaluate if the bird and branch appear naturally integrated into the new environment.
Question: Does the bird and the branch it stands on blend well with the city balcony setting, maintaining their structural consistency and visual credibility?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the sub requirement of "avoiding distortion in geometric shapes and preserving fine details", analyze if the replacement of the background retains the branch's form and texture.
Question: Has the texture and structure of the branch remained intact and undistorted after replacing the forest background with a city balcony?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement of "ensuring the proportion and physical rationality of each element", examine if the size and perspective of the cityscape relative to the bird on the branch are logically consistent.
Question: Do the proportions and relative sizes of the bird, branch, and city skyline appear physically plausible and natural in the edited image?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "maintaining the overall sense of reality and natural appearance during editing", consider if the light and shadow effects in the city balcony setting correspond appropriately with the bird and branch.
Question: Does the lighting and shadow play on the bird, branch, and cityscape match naturally, contributing to the overall realism of the image?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
