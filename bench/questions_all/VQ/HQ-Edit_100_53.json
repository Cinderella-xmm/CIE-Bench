      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the image into a traditional Japanese woodblock print style, evaluate whether the figure’s kimono has been stylized with bold outlines and flat colors while maintaining structural coherence. The original image shows a detailed, realistic kimono with flowing floral patterns; the editing should preserve its shape and proportions but simplify textures and apply uniform color fields typical of ukiyo-e art. This involves checking if the outline is clearly defined without blurring or jagged edges, and whether the color transitions are abrupt and flat as expected in woodblock prints.",
      "question": "Does the kimono feature bold, clean outlines and uniformly flat color regions without gradient blending or photographic texture?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to stylize cherry blossoms with simplified forms and muted pinks, assess whether the tree branches and flowers have been abstracted appropriately. In the original image, the blossoms are dense and realistically rendered. After editing, they should appear as simplified, geometrically consistent shapes with reduced detail and softer pink tones, consistent with ukiyo-e aesthetics. The evaluation focuses on whether the simplified forms retain a natural spatial arrangement and avoid unnatural clustering or distortion.",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms represented with simplified, stylized shapes and muted pink hues, avoiding photorealistic detail or irregular clumping?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to rework the path and poles with textured patterns reflecting an Edo-period aesthetic, evaluate whether the stone pathway and wooden posts now display hand-carved or woodblock-style textures. The original image shows smooth, modern-looking stones and cylindrical poles. After editing, these elements should exhibit visible grain, linear patterns, or stippling effects typical of woodblock printing. The question checks for visual consistency between the new texture and the overall stylistic transformation.",
      "question": "Do the path stones and vertical poles display textured patterns such as hatching, stippling, or woodgrain that align with traditional woodblock printing techniques?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to maintain structural consistency and visual credibility during style conversion, evaluate whether the figure’s posture and silhouette remain anatomically plausible after stylization. The original image shows a woman standing upright with a long trailing kimono. The edited version must preserve correct limb proportions and alignment, especially at joints and the curvature of the spine. Any warping or elongation would indicate distortion incompatible with both realism and artistic convention.",
      "question": "Is the figure's body proportionate and structurally sound, with no exaggerated limbs, distorted joints, or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to reflect classic ukiyo-e landscapes with distant rolling hills, assess whether the background features simplified, layered hills in soft tones and perspective depth. The original image has a softly blurred background with warm gradients suggesting depth. After editing, this should be transformed into stylized, flat-colored mountain silhouettes with clear layering, resembling traditional Japanese landscape compositions. The evaluation checks for coherent horizon lines and absence of mismatched depth cues.",
      "question": "Are the distant hills depicted as simplified, layered forms with flat colors and clear outlines, consistent with traditional ukiyo-e landscape conventions?",
