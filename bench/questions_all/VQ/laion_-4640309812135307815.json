      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence with the original silhouette during the transformation of the dress into a glass flacon, this question evaluates whether the elongated shape and vertical proportions of the dress are preserved in the bottle form. The key editing position is the entire length of the dress, now converted into a bottle. The question focuses on whether the geometry remains intact and physically plausible.",
      "question": "Does the transformed bottle maintain the same elongated vertical silhouette as the original dress, with no compression or stretching of the form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of translating fabric petals into embossed glass patterns, this question assesses whether the petal shapes remain recognizable and spatially consistent when rendered on glass. The editing position is the area where the large red floral appliqué was originally located on the bodice and cascading down the skirt. The focus is on texture and dimensional fidelity.",
      "question": "Are the petal motifs clearly visible as raised embossments on the glass surface, with consistent depth and spacing matching the original dress's design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of designing a cap resembling a stylized red flower that matches the dress’s aesthetic, this question checks if the cap is proportionally and stylistically coherent with the rest of the bottle. The editing position is the top of the bottle, where the cap is attached. The evaluation includes shape, scale, and integration.",
      "question": "Is the cap shaped like a stylized red flower with natural petal curvature and symmetry, and does it sit properly on the bottle neck without floating or overlapping unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating a metallic label with cursive text without visual artifacts, this question examines the placement and appearance of the label on the glass surface. The editing position is the midsection of the bottle, where the label would be affixed. The focus is on material consistency and alignment.",
      "question": "Is the metallic label seamlessly attached to the glass surface with smooth edges, realistic reflection, and legible cursive text, without blurring, misalignment, or shadow mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving physical plausibility in the bottle’s proportions, this question evaluates whether the neck, body, and base of the flacon follow realistic dimensions for a fragrance bottle. The editing position is the full structure of the bottle. The assessment focuses on geometric integrity and balance.",
      "question": "Are the neck, body, and base of the bottle proportionally balanced and structurally sound, with no unnatural tapering or abrupt shape changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts during material transformation, this question checks for visual anomalies at the interface between the original dress and the new glass form. The editing position is the transition zone along the sides and hem of the dress where the fabric meets the glass. The focus is on texture continuity and edge quality.",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, pixelation, or color bleeding at the boundary where the fabric dress transitions into the glass bottle, indicating poor blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
