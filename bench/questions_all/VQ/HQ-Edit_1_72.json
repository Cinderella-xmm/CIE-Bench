      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the man’s attire into a regal Dashiki with gold embellishments, this involves modifying the texture, color, and pattern of the clothing. The original image shows a colorful Dashiki-style garment with geometric patterns. The editing instruction emphasizes gold embellishments, which must be integrated without disrupting the natural flow of fabric or introducing unnatural highlights or textures. This evaluation focuses on whether the added gold elements appear physically plausible and consistent with textile materials.",
      "question": "Are the gold embellishments on the Dashiki naturally integrated into the fabric, showing realistic reflective properties and no floating or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies adding beads and symbols at the shoulders. These are new elements not present in the original image. Their placement must respect anatomical structure and spatial logic—beads should follow shoulder contours without overlapping unnaturally or distorting the garment’s shape. Material appearance (e.g., metallic sheen, string texture) must also be consistent with real-world objects.",
      "question": "Do the beads and symbols on the shoulders align correctly with the shoulder anatomy and exhibit natural material textures without distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The background is to be transformed into a vast savanna with stylized Acacia trees and vivid wild grasses. The original image already features a savanna landscape with Acacia trees, so the editing involves enhancing and stylizing these elements. The key perceptual quality concern is whether the stylization introduces unnatural shapes, such as overly symmetrical or geometrically broken tree forms, or if the grass appears artificially patterned rather than organically distributed.",
      "question": "Are the Acacia trees in the background proportionally accurate and structurally coherent, with natural branching patterns and no visible geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for enhancing the background with a pattern of vivid wild grasses. While grass is present in the original image, the enhancement may involve increasing density, color saturation, or introducing repetitive patterns. The challenge is maintaining visual credibility—grass should not appear as uniform tiles or artificial overlays but retain natural variation in height, color, and direction.",
      "question": "Does the wild grass in the foreground and midground display natural variation in height, color, and orientation, avoiding repetitive or tiled patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The hands are positioned clasped in front of the body in the original image. Any editing involving the hands—such as altering their position, adding accessories, or modifying skin texture—must preserve anatomical accuracy. The number of fingers should remain five per hand, and the joint lines, shadows, and lighting should match the rest of the figure. The editing instruction does not specify changes to hands, so they should remain unchanged and visually consistent.",
      "question": "Do the hands show five fingers each, with natural joint alignment, skin texture, and shading that matches the rest of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
