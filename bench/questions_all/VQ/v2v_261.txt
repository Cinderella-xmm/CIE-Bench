Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the overall realism and natural appearance when transforming the scene into a snow globe setting, we need to evaluate if the transition from the beach scene to a miniature setting inside a snow globe retains structural coherence and visual plausibility.
Question: Does the miniature beach and surfer figure inside the snow globe appear structurally consistent and visually credible compared to the original beach scene?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of avoiding unnatural textures and loss of details, especially focusing on the surfer's hands and the surfboard, we need to ensure these elements retain their natural appearance and fine details after being transformed into a chibi-style 3D figure.
Question: Are the hands of the chibi-style 3D surfer figure free of unnatural textures and maintain the correct number of fingers?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of ensuring the maintained style reflects the overall sense of reality and natural appearance, we need to assess if the soft golden light filtering through the glass dome and the sparkles scattered around contribute to a natural and plausible atmosphere.
Question: Does the soft golden light and sparkles scattered around the snow globe create a natural and plausible warm atmosphere without introducing obvious artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement of avoiding distortions such as damaged geometric shapes, we need to verify if the transformation of the surfer and surfboard into a miniature scale within the snow globe preserves their geometric integrity.
Question: Do the geometric shapes of the miniature surfer figure and surfboard remain intact and undistorted within the snow globe?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: In line with the sub requirement of ensuring the proportion and physical rationality of each element, we need to confirm that the placement of the snow globe on the wooden shelf near the fireplace maintains a visually credible and realistic composition.
Question: Is the placement of the snow globe on the wooden shelf near the fireplace visually credible and proportionally realistic?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
