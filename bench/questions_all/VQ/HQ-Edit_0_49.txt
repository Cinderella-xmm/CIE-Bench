Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "miniaturizing the ornate teapot into a decorative 3D display within a glass dome", evaluate whether the scale and proportions of the teapot have been reduced appropriately without distorting its original structure or introducing unnatural scaling artifacts. The original teapot is large and detailed, so miniaturization must preserve geometric integrity and material consistency.
Question: Is the teapot proportionally scaled down while maintaining its original shape, surface details, and structural coherence?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "positioning the teapot atop a mirrored base with small porcelain cups encircling it", assess whether the addition of the mirrored base and surrounding cups is physically plausible and visually consistent with the original teapot's material and lighting environment. The mirror should reflect the teapot and surroundings realistically, and the cups should be proportionally sized and positioned to avoid overcrowding or spatial inconsistency.
Question: Are the porcelain cups arranged around the base in a balanced, non-overlapping manner, and do they appear to be made of realistic ceramic material with appropriate reflections and shadows?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "adding tiny, detailed engravings on an elevation, amplifying its intricate patterns", evaluate whether the added engravings are consistent with the original ornamental style of the teapot and are not introduced as overly sharp, repetitive, or artificial textures that break the natural flow of the design.
Question: Do the new engravings on the elevated surface match the existing decorative patterns in style and depth, without appearing pixelated, duplicated, or unnaturally enhanced?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "surrounding the scene with faux steam spirals winding upwards", assess whether the steam elements are rendered with plausible motion blur, transparency, and interaction with light, and whether they emerge naturally from the teapot without violating physical logic (e.g., rising from a non-existent heat source).
Question: Do the steam spirals rise smoothly from the teapot’s spout and lid area, exhibiting soft edges, proper translucency, and consistent lighting interaction?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "placing the entire setup under a glass dome", evaluate whether the glass dome introduces realistic refraction, reflection, and subtle distortion effects consistent with transparent curved surfaces, and whether it does not obscure or distort the teapot’s form or introduce unnatural highlights or caustics.
Question: Does the glass dome show accurate light refraction and surface reflections, allowing clear visibility of the teapot and surrounding elements without visual distortion or artificial glare?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
