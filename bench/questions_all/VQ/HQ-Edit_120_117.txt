Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the lighthouse scene into a nautical globe display, which involves replacing the entire environment with a globe structure. This transformation affects the core spatial layout and physical logic of the original image. The lighthouse must now be rendered as a miniature 3D model inside a transparent spherical globe, altering its scale, perspective, and surrounding context. Attention must be paid to whether the transition from real-world scenery to a stylized enclosed globe maintains structural coherence, avoids distortions in geometry, and preserves realistic textures and materials.
-Sub requirement 1: Replace the full scene (lighthouse, ocean, sky, rocks) with a globe enclosure; evaluate whether the new globe structure maintains geometric integrity and visual plausibility without unnatural warping or misalignment.
-Sub requirement 2: Insert a miniature 3D lighthouse model inside the globe; assess whether the scaled-down version retains proportional accuracy and structural consistency relative to the original lighthouse, avoiding deformation or loss of architectural detail.
-Sub requirement 3: Replace natural waves with translucent blue resin waves; determine if the material appearance is consistent with resin (smooth, semi-transparent, reflective), and whether it integrates naturally within the globe without artificial edges or texture mismatches.
-Sub requirement 4: Add a wooden base with an engraved compass rose; verify that the wood grain, engraving depth, and lighting are realistic and match the style of the globe’s overall aesthetic.
-Sub requirement 5: Integrate painted clouds and distant mountain panorama into the background of the globe; check whether these elements appear layered correctly and maintain depth cues without flattening or overlapping inconsistencies.
-Sub requirement 6: Ensure color palette shift to earthy tones for rocks and vibrant blues for water; confirm that colors remain harmonious and do not introduce unnatural contrasts or saturation anomalies.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the full scene with a globe enclosure, this question evaluates whether the spherical boundary of the globe is clearly defined and geometrically consistent, ensuring no stretching, tearing, or misaligned curvature that would compromise the perception of a solid glass-like sphere.
Question: Is the outer surface of the globe smooth and uniformly curved without visible distortion or jagged edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of inserting a miniature 3D lighthouse model inside the globe, this question checks whether the scaled-down version of the lighthouse maintains correct proportions and architectural details such as windows, door, and lantern room, ensuring it does not appear stretched, compressed, or structurally broken.
Question: Does the miniature lighthouse inside the globe have accurate window placements and structural symmetry matching the original lighthouse?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing natural waves with translucent blue resin, this question evaluates whether the wave forms appear fluid and transparent with internal light refraction effects typical of resin, and whether they lack sharp seams or pixelated textures indicating digital artifacts.
Question: Are the waves made of translucent blue resin visually continuous with smooth surfaces and subtle internal reflections, showing no blocky or fragmented textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a wooden base with an engraved compass rose, this question assesses whether the wood grain appears natural, the engraving lines are clean and evenly spaced, and the base supports the globe without floating or misalignment issues.
Question: Is the wooden base flat and grounded beneath the globe, with visible wood grain and engraved lines that follow a consistent radial pattern?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of integrating painted clouds and distant mountains into the globe’s background, this question checks whether these elements are positioned behind the globe at a proper depth, with soft edges and atmospheric perspective, avoiding placement errors like appearing in front of or intersecting with the globe.
Question: Are the painted clouds and distant mountains located behind the globe, creating a sense of depth without overlapping or intersecting with the globe's surface?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of applying earthy tones to rocks and vibrant blues to water, this question evaluates whether the color transitions between rock and water are natural, with no abrupt shifts or unnatural hues that suggest over-saturation or incorrect tinting.
Question: Do the rocks display earthy brown and green tones while the water shows vibrant blue with gradient shading, maintaining color harmony across the scene?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
