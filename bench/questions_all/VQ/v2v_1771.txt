Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "whether the addition of a snowy tundra landscape affects the overall realism and natural appearance," assess if the new background maintains a natural look and blends well with the tower.
Question: Does the snowy tundra landscape appear naturally integrated with the Leaning Tower of Pisa without any visible seams or unnatural edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of "maintaining the style, materials, and features to reflect overall reality and natural appearance," evaluate if the texture and material of the snowy landscape match the existing elements of the image.
Question: Are the textures and materials of the snowy tundra landscape consistent with the natural appearance of the original image, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of "ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility of the retained core element," verify if the tower retains its structural integrity and proportions after the background change.
Question: Does the Leaning Tower of Pisa maintain its structural coherence and proportions against the new snowy tundra background, without any distortion or broken geometric shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the sub requirement of "avoiding the introduction of artifacts such as unnatural textures and loss of details," examine if the fine details of the tower and the new background remain intact.
Question: Have the fine architectural details of the Leaning Tower of Pisa been preserved, and does the snowy tundra background lack any unnatural textures or loss of detail?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "whether the proportion and physical rationality of each element avoid distortion," assess if the scale and placement of the snowy landscape elements make logical sense in relation to the tower.
Question: Do the elements of the snowy tundra landscape, such as snow-covered ground and trees, appear physically plausible and proportionate relative to the size of the Leaning Tower of Pisa?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
