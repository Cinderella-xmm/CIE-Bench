Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the overall realism and natural appearance while converting the thermometer into a 3D cartoon style, we need to assess if the transformation retains the structural coherence and visual plausibility of the original thermometer.
Question: Does the 3D cartoon style of the thermometer maintain its structural consistency without introducing unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of ensuring the thermometer's sleek metallic finish appears natural and visually credible after applying soft lighting, we need to evaluate if the lighting enhances the material's appearance without creating unrealistic artifacts.
Question: Are the soft lighting effects on the thermometer's metallic surface natural, enhancing its finish without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement of incorporating stats like [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] while preserving the overall authenticity, we need to verify if these additions integrate seamlessly into the design without disrupting the visual flow.
Question: Do the added stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] appear naturally integrated into the design without causing visual clutter or distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of featuring a title banner labeled "Precision Thermal Gauge" and a nameplate at the bottom, we need to confirm if these text elements are placed coherently and do not introduce any visual inconsistencies.
Question: Are the title banner and nameplate text elements positioned logically and clearly visible, contributing to the overall visual credibility without disrupting the layout?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of surrounding the card with crisp borders and using a background that conveys scientific precision, we need to evaluate if these elements enhance the collectible appearance without compromising the natural look.
Question: Do the crisp borders and cool-toned background complement the thermometer's function and appearance, maintaining a professional and authentic look without introducing visual artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
