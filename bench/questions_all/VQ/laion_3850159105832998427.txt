Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction involves transforming the guitar into an enchanted dragon, which requires significant morphological changes to multiple parts of the original object. The headstock (with tuning pegs) must be replaced with golden horn-like spikes, indicating a complete redesign of the top portion of the instrument. This transformation affects the structural coherence and visual plausibility of the upper body, especially in terms of proportion and material consistency. The replacement of tuning pegs with horns introduces new geometric forms that must align with the existing neck curvature and maintain a natural transition from wood to metallic texture.
-Sub requirement 1: Replace the tuning pegs on the headstock with golden, horn-like spikes—evaluate whether the new elements are seamlessly integrated, maintain consistent material appearance (metallic gold), and do not distort the neck’s geometry or introduce unnatural textures.

-<Thinking Process 2>: The fretboard is to be embellished with luminescent runes. This involves adding glowing symbols along the dark wood surface. The challenge lies in ensuring these runes appear as if embedded or etched into the wood, without disrupting the natural grain pattern or causing visible artifacts like pixelation, haloing, or inconsistent brightness levels. The luminescence should be subtle and localized to avoid overwhelming the surrounding area.
-Sub requirement 2: Add luminescent runes on the fretboard—assess whether the runes are clearly defined, evenly distributed, and exhibit a soft glow without bleeding into adjacent areas or distorting the wood texture beneath.

-<Thinking Process 3>: The strings are to be converted into fiery tendrils. This transformation affects the central vertical axis of the guitar, where six thin metal strings become dynamic, flame-like structures. The physical logic of string tension and attachment points at both bridge and nut must still be preserved, even though their form has changed. The flames must originate from the bridge and extend upward, maintaining continuity and avoiding abrupt breaks or floating segments.
-Sub requirement 3: Convert the guitar strings into fiery tendrils—evaluate whether the tendrils emerge naturally from the bridge and nut, follow the original string path, and maintain consistent flame shape and directionality without appearing disconnected or misaligned.

-<Thinking Process 4>: The cutaway horns (the curved edges near the body) are to become majestic wings with scale-like patterns. These features are located on the sides of the guitar body and are critical for maintaining the overall silhouette. Transforming them into wings requires extending outward while preserving symmetry and structural integrity. The scales must be uniformly sized and arranged in a plausible biological pattern, avoiding irregular spacing or unnatural curvature.
-Sub requirement 4: Morph the cutaway horns into wings with scale-like patterns—check whether the wing shapes extend logically from the body, maintain bilateral symmetry, and feature coherent, repeating scale textures without gaps or distortions.

-<Thinking Process 5>: The entire guitar body becomes the torso of a dragon. This implies a holistic transformation where the original wooden body is reinterpreted as organic tissue, possibly with skin or armored plates. The transition from wood to dragon anatomy must preserve the general outline and proportions of the original guitar while introducing new surface details such as muscle definition, ridges, or breath effects. The color shift from brown wood to reptilian tones must be smooth and contextually appropriate.
-Sub requirement 5: Reinterpret the guitar body as a dragon's torso—assess whether the body retains its original silhouette, transitions smoothly to dragon-like textures, and avoids abrupt material shifts or loss of fine details such as grain or contours.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the tuning pegs with golden horn-like spikes on the headstock, evaluate whether the new elements are physically plausible and integrate naturally with the neck’s curvature. The horns must emerge from the same plane as the original pegs and maintain proportional alignment with the fretboard.
Question: Do the golden horn-like spikes on the headstock align symmetrically with the neck and show no signs of clipping, distortion, or mismatched angles?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding luminescent runes on the fretboard, assess whether the runes are embedded realistically into the wood surface without disrupting the natural grain or creating artificial glows. The glow should be localized and consistent across all runes.
Question: Are the luminescent runes clearly visible along the fretboard without bleeding into the wood or appearing as separate floating overlays?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the strings into fiery tendrils, check whether the tendrils follow the original string path from bridge to nut and remain connected at both ends. Each tendril should have a consistent width and flame-like structure without breaking mid-path.
Question: Do the fiery tendrils originate from the bridge and terminate at the nut, following a continuous and uninterrupted path without gaps or floating segments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the cutaway horns into wings with scale-like patterns, evaluate whether the wings extend outward symmetrically from the body and display uniform, repeating scale textures. The wings should not overlap or fold unnaturally.
Question: Are the wing structures symmetrical on both sides of the body and covered in evenly spaced, realistic scale patterns without gaps or distortions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of reinterpreting the guitar body as a dragon's torso, assess whether the transformation preserves the original body shape while introducing organic textures. The surface should transition smoothly from wood to dragon skin without abrupt changes or missing details.
Question: Does the body maintain the original guitar's silhouette while showing consistent dragon-like textures such as scales or ridges, with no visible seams or loss of contour detail?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
