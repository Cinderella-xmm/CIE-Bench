      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the field into a floating island, evaluate whether the grassy terrain appears to be suspended in mid-air without any visible support or grounding, and whether the edges of the island show unnatural geometric breaks or distortions. This affects structural coherence and visual plausibility.",
      "question": "Does the green field appear to float above the starry background with clean, continuous edges and no visible distortions or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of accentuating vibrant flower colors, assess whether the yellow and red flowers exhibit exaggerated but natural-looking saturation levels, avoiding pixelation, color bleeding, or unnatural textures that would suggest digital overprocessing.",
      "question": "Are the yellow and red flowers vividly colored but free from unnatural texture artifacts or color fringing around their petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the moon with an oversized apple, determine whether the apple is proportionally large compared to the surrounding landscape, maintains realistic surface texture (such as skin detail and lighting), and is positioned logically within the sky without disrupting the spatial depth.",
      "question": "Is the apple-shaped object in the sky significantly larger than the tree and properly lit with consistent shading and texture, resembling a real fruit rather than a flat graphic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting insects into playful, stylized motifs, examine whether the bee and butterfly retain recognizable forms while being artistically alteredâ€”ensuring they do not become unrecognizable or morphologically distorted, and that their placement remains plausible in the scene.",
      "question": "Are the insect figures (bee and butterfly) stylized but still identifiable, with smooth contours and no anatomical deformities or fragmented parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reinterpreting the tree as a hollow geometric structure, evaluate whether the tree has been transformed into a shape composed of clear, sharp geometric planes (e.g., cubes, pyramids) while maintaining a coherent silhouette and consistent shadowing relative to the light source.",
      "question": "Is the tree replaced by a hollow, angular geometric form with clean lines and internal voids, matching the surreal style without appearing fragmented or physically impossible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
