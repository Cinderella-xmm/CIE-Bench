Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the shirt design into a vibrant pop art-style mural using bold color blocks and sharp geometric lines, evaluate whether the color transformation across the entire shirt maintains visual coherence and avoids unnatural transitions or color bleeding. The original image features intricate golden line art on a dark background; the editing must preserve structural integrity while introducing bold colors without distorting the underlying patterns.
Question: Are the color blocks applied across the shirtâ€™s surface uniform and sharply defined, with no visible smudging or blending between adjacent areas?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of reimagining intricate patterns in neon tones with dynamic, repetitive motifs, assess whether the new patterns maintain geometric consistency and repeat logically across the shirt's surface. The original design includes symmetrical floral and tribal motifs; these should be preserved in structure but updated in style to match pop art aesthetics.
Question: Do the neon-colored patterns repeat consistently across the shirt, maintaining symmetry and alignment with the original layout?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of accentuating the muscular figure with sharp geometric lines, evaluate whether the contours and musculature of the central figure remain anatomically plausible after stylization. The original image shows a detailed depiction of a human form with defined limbs and posture; any geometric enhancement must not distort proportions or introduce unnatural angles.
Question: Are the limbs and torso of the central figure proportionally accurate, with no exaggerated or broken joint lines that violate physical realism?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of avoiding unnatural textures and loss of fine details during style conversion, examine whether the transition from line art to pop art preserves fine elements such as hair strands, facial features, and decorative patterns. The original image contains delicate linework around the face and clothing; these must remain legible and intact.
Question: Are the fine details such as facial features, hair texture, and ornamental lines clearly visible and unbroken in the edited version?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility in the composition, evaluate whether the spatial relationships between the central figure and surrounding patterns remain coherent. The original image positions the figure centrally within a circular frame; this framing must be preserved even with added pop art elements.
Question: Is the central figure properly aligned within the circular frame, with no misalignment or distortion of the bordering geometric shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
