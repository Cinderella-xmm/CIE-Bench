Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction requires constructing a majestic creature inspired by the ornate building in Image A, meaning the creature must visually echo the architectural features such as spires, layered roofs, columns, and intricate textures. This involves transforming the static building into a living entity while preserving its structural complexity and aesthetic details. The transformation must maintain visual coherence between the original architecture and the new creature form, ensuring that the added elements (such as limbs, body structure) do not distort or break the original geometric logic of the building. Attention must be paid to material consistency—e.g., whether stone-like surfaces remain plausible when forming organic parts—and whether the creature's proportions align with physical plausibility. Additionally, the custom orb at its feet must integrate seamlessly with the architectural style, featuring pillars and arches without appearing glued-on or texturally mismatched. The invented name and elemental type should be placed nearby without disrupting the composition or introducing visual clutter. All edits must avoid unnatural textures, broken geometry, or loss of fine detail.

-Sub requirement 1: Transform the building into a creature form that retains the original architectural spires, layered roofs, and columnar structures, ensuring that the transition from static structure to animate form does not introduce distorted or broken geometric shapes.
-Sub requirement 2: Add a custom orb at the creature’s feet that incorporates architectural motifs like pillars and arches, maintaining consistent texture and material appearance with the rest of the creature and environment.
-Sub requirement 3: Display an invented name near the creature, ensuring it is legible and positioned without obstructing key visual elements or disrupting the scene’s balance.
-Sub requirement 4: Assign a reflective elemental type (e.g., Mystic, Stone, Regal) via visible labeling or symbolic representation, ensuring it integrates naturally into the scene without visual inconsistency.
-Sub requirement 5: Ensure all added elements (creature, orb, text, label) preserve fine details, smooth shading, and natural textures, avoiding artifacts such as pixelation, jagged edges, or color bleeding.
-Sub requirement 6: Maintain structural coherence between the creature’s body and the original building’s design, ensuring proportional relationships and spatial logic are preserved (e.g., no disproportionately large limbs or floating components).
-Sub requirement 7: Ensure the reflection in the water remains consistent with the edited elements, accurately mirroring the creature, orb, and text without distortion or mismatched reflections.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the building into a creature while retaining its spires and layered roof structures, this question evaluates whether the creature’s form maintains the original geometric integrity of the building. Specifically, it checks if the spires remain upright and structurally sound, and if the transitions from roof to limb or body are smooth and physically plausible, avoiding warped or collapsed forms.
Question: Are the spires and roof layers of the creature aligned with the original building's structure, showing no signs of bending, breaking, or misalignment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a custom orb at the creature’s feet with architectural motifs, this question assesses whether the orb’s design (pillars, arches) matches the material and style of the creature and surrounding environment. It checks for texture continuity, proportionality, and integration with the ground surface.
Question: Does the orb at the creature’s feet feature pillars and arches that match the architectural style of the creature and have consistent texture and lighting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of displaying an invented name near the creature, this question evaluates whether the text is clearly visible, properly scaled, and positioned without overlapping critical elements or causing visual imbalance. It also checks for readability and stylistic harmony with the fantasy theme.
Question: Is the invented name displayed near the creature legible, properly sized, and positioned without overlapping the creature or water reflection?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of assigning a reflective elemental type (e.g., Mystic, Stone), this question checks whether the elemental label is present, readable, and stylistically consistent with the scene. It ensures the label does not appear as a random overlay but integrates naturally, possibly through subtle iconography or font choice.
Question: Is the elemental type label (e.g., Mystic, Stone) visible near the creature and styled to match the overall fantasy aesthetic without appearing digitally pasted?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving fine details and smooth shading, this question evaluates whether the creature’s surface shows natural gradients, consistent lighting, and absence of artifacts such as jagged edges, smudges, or texture repetition. It focuses on the quality of rendering across the entire creature, especially at junctions between architectural and organic forms.
Question: Does the creature’s surface display smooth shading and consistent texture across all architectural elements, with no visible pixelation, blurring, or unnatural color patches?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence and visual credibility, this question examines whether the creature’s limbs or body parts are proportionally balanced relative to the original building’s scale. It checks for physical plausibility, such as whether legs support the weight of the upper structure and whether joints are anatomically coherent.
Question: Are the creature’s limbs proportionally sized and structurally connected to the main body in a way that suggests physical stability and logical weight distribution?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q7: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of accurate reflection in the water, this question evaluates whether the reflection of the creature, orb, and text is mirrored correctly in terms of shape, position, and lighting. It checks for symmetry and clarity, ensuring the reflection enhances realism rather than introducing distortions.
Question: Does the water reflection accurately mirror the creature, orb, and any nearby text, showing correct orientation and lighting without warping or ghosting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
