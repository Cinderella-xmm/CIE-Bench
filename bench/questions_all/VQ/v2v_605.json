      "thinking_process": "Considering the sub requirement of maintaining the overall realism and natural appearance while designing the gorilla as a Funko Pop-style box, we need to assess if the transition from a realistic gorilla to a stylized Funko Pop figure retains visual plausibility and avoids introducing unnatural textures or distortions.",
      "question": "Does the Funko Pop-style box maintain a consistent texture and color scheme that aligns naturally with the theme of the gorilla, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",

      "thinking_process": "The sub requirement emphasizes retaining the core element's structural consistency and visual credibility. When converting the realistic gorilla into a chibi-style figure within the box, it's crucial to ensure that the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi figure remain plausible and coherent.",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the chibi-style gorilla figure inside the box structurally consistent and visually credible, without any distorted or deformed features?",

      "thinking_process": "To evaluate the perceptual quality of the edited image, we need to consider if the realistic illustration of the gorilla beside the box showcases detailed textures and lighting that contribute to a lifelike product display. This involves checking for the absence of unnatural textures or loss of fine details.",
      "question": "Does the realistic illustration of the gorilla beside the box exhibit detailed textures and lighting that enhance the lifelike appearance, without any loss of fine details or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [

      "thinking_process": "The sub requirement focuses on ensuring that the style conversion from a realistic gorilla to a Funko Pop-style box maintains a certain sense of realism without obvious unnatural artifacts. This includes assessing the visual credibility of the packaging design and the title \"JUNGLE KING.\"",
      "question": "Is the design of the Funko Pop-style box, including the title \"JUNGLE KING,\" visually credible and free from any obvious unnatural artifacts that could detract from the overall realism?",

      "thinking_process": "The sub requirement highlights the importance of avoiding distortions such as damaged geometric shapes and ensuring the physical rationality of each element. This applies particularly to the accessories like the leafy crown, wooden staff, and jungle-themed details accompanying the chibi-style figure.",
      "question": "Do the accessories (leafy crown, wooden staff, and jungle-themed details) accompanying the chibi-style gorilla figure appear physically rational and undistorted, contributing to the overall visual credibility?",
