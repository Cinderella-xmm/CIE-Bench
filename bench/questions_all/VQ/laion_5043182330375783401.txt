Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the figure into an Art Deco-inspired poster, the suit must be stylized into bold geometric shapes with metallic silver and blue hues. This involves altering the original dark, textured suit into a highly structured, patterned form. The evaluation focuses on whether the new geometric shapes maintain structural coherence and visual plausibility without distorting the human form or introducing unnatural breaks in the silhouette.
Question: Are the geometric shapes applied to the suit clearly defined, aligned with the contours of the body, and free from jagged or broken edges that disrupt the figure’s natural posture?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: The editing instruction specifies rendering the chair with streamlined patterns consistent with Art Deco style. The original image shows a simple wooden chair partially visible beneath the figure's arm. The transformation requires replacing or modifying this element to include sharp, symmetrical lines and possibly reflective surfaces. Evaluation focuses on whether the modified chair retains physical rationality—such as proper support structure and proportion relative to the figure—and avoids floating or misaligned parts.
Question: Does the chair retain a stable, grounded structure with symmetrical, flowing patterns that align with the figure’s seated position and do not appear to float or tilt unnaturally?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: The background is to be rendered in a vibrant sunset gradient, replacing the original neutral beige tone. This change affects the entire backdrop and may interact with the figure’s lighting and shadows. The evaluation checks if the gradient transitions smoothly across the canvas, maintains consistency in direction and intensity, and does not create artificial halos or color bleeding around the figure’s edges.
Question: Is the sunset gradient in the background smooth and continuous, with no abrupt color shifts or haloing along the edges of the figure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The suit is to be rendered in metallic silver and blue hues, which introduces reflective material properties. The original suit appears matte and dark. Evaluating this change involves checking whether the metallic finish is applied consistently across the surface, respects light direction (e.g., highlights follow logical angles), and avoids unnatural sheen or texture repetition that suggests digital artifacting.
Question: Do the metallic silver and blue areas of the suit show coherent highlights and reflections that follow a single light source and avoid repeating textures or unnatural glossiness?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The hand resting on the chair is a critical anatomical detail. The editing instruction may involve stylizing the hand within the Art Deco framework, potentially altering its proportions or adding decorative elements. The evaluation ensures the hand remains anatomically plausible—five fingers, correct joint alignment, natural curvature—and that no distortion occurs, such as fused fingers or exaggerated elongation.
Question: Does the hand on the chair have five distinct fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and are the joints and knuckles proportionally accurate and not distorted by stylization?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
