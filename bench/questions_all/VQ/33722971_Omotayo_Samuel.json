      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding whimsical facial features to each suitcase, evaluate whether the facial elements (e.g., eyes, mouth) are integrated into the original geometric shapes (rectangular, round, duffel) without distorting their form. The dark blue duffel bag, white round case, and two brown suitcases must retain their original silhouettes while incorporating facial features that do not cause bulging, stretching, or misalignment.",
      "question": "Do the facial features on each suitcase align naturally with the object’s shape without distorting its geometry or creating unnatural protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the human figure into a whimsical traveler figurehead, assess whether the figure's limbs, head, and torso maintain anatomical accuracy. Specifically, check the number of fingers, joint alignment, and posture to ensure no deformation occurs during stylization. The figure stands upright with hands in pockets; the hand positions must not show extra digits or bent joints that violate ergonomics.",
      "question": "Does the figure have five fingers per hand, with natural hand shape and joint alignment, and no anatomical deformities or missing limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying a velvet texture across the scene, evaluate whether the texture is uniformly applied to the figure’s coat, hat, and all suitcases. Check for consistent light interaction (soft highlights, subtle pile direction) and absence of repeating patterns, pixelation, or mismatched edges between texture and base shape.",
      "question": "Is the velvet texture applied smoothly across all surfaces without visible seams, repetition, or unnatural lighting reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the green background with a world map backdrop, assess whether the map is correctly scaled and aligned with the scene’s perspective. The map should not appear warped, clipped, or out of proportion relative to the figure and suitcases. Shadows and lighting should still originate from the same source and cast appropriately.",
      "question": "Is the world map backdrop properly aligned with the scene’s perspective and does it integrate seamlessly without warping or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enclosing the scene in a large display case, evaluate whether the case structure (glass panels, frame) is geometrically sound and proportionally correct. The case must fully contain the figure and suitcases without cutting through them, and glass should show appropriate reflections or transparency without distorting the contents.",
      "question": "Is the display case fully enclosing the scene with correct proportions, no clipping of elements, and realistic glass transparency or reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts and maintaining fine detail, evaluate whether the editing introduced any visible digital flaws such as blurring, ghosting, or loss of detail in areas like stitching on the suitcases, hair strands, or texture transitions. The original image has clear textures; these should be preserved or enhanced, not degraded.",
      "question": "Are all fine details (e.g., stitching, hair, texture edges) preserved and free from blurring, ghosting, or pixelation after editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
