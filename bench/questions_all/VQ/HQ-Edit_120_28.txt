Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "creating a weathered pirate map background with the treasure chest as the central landmark, highlighted with detailed ink sketches", evaluate whether the transition from the original wooden deck and ship elements to a map-like surface maintains structural coherence. The editing involves replacing or overlaying the existing floor and surrounding areas with a parchment-style texture while preserving the chestâ€™s position and proportions. This change must not distort the chest's geometry or introduce unnatural textures in the background.
Question: Is the treasure chest still geometrically intact and proportionally consistent with its original form when placed on the newly added weathered map background?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "using ropes and nautical elements as decorative borders, integrating the ship's mast and sails at corners for thematic cohesion", assess whether the ropes and rigging elements have been repositioned or stylized into border designs without breaking their natural shape or material properties. The ropes should retain their fibrous texture and coiled structure even when used decoratively.
Question: Do the ropes used as decorative borders maintain their natural fiber texture and realistic coil shapes without appearing stretched, flattened, or unnaturally contorted?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "including a legend with symbols representing coins, gems, and pottery, marked in bold, ancient-style typography", evaluate whether the added legend elements (symbols and text) are seamlessly integrated into the image without disrupting the spatial logic or introducing artifacts like pixelation, misalignment, or inconsistent lighting. The typography must match the theme but not override the realism of the scene.
Question: Are the symbols and ancient-style text in the legend aligned properly with the overall lighting and depth of the image, and do they appear cleanly rendered without jagged edges or color bleeding?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "overlaying a compass rose in the bottom-right corner using rich, metallic hues reflective of the coins", determine whether the compass rose has been added in a way that matches the material appearance of the gold coins and other treasures, without creating a mismatch in reflectivity, shadow, or scale. It must be physically plausible in relation to the objects nearby.
Question: Does the compass rose in the bottom-right corner have consistent metallic sheen and shadowing that aligns with the lighting direction and material properties of the surrounding gold coins and gems?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "enriching with subtle, intricate motifs like sea monsters, enhancing the mysterious, adventurous feel", evaluate whether these added motifs (e.g., sea creatures) are drawn with fine detail and integrated into the map background without distorting the underlying textures or appearing as floating, unconnected overlays. Their placement should respect the spatial logic of the map.
Question: Are the sea monster motifs seamlessly blended into the map background, maintaining consistent line thickness and shading with the rest of the ink drawings, and do they not appear as disjointed or misplaced elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
