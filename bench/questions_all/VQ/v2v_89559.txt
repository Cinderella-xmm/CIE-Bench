Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of transforming the 'Search for a Star' and 'Rising Star' logos into gleaming golden award statuettes, we need to assess if the transformation maintains structural coherence and avoids introducing unnatural textures or distortions. The original logos are distinct in shape and color, so the transformation should retain these characteristics while adapting them into statuettes.

Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: The 'Sumo Digital' logo is to be rendered as an embossed seal on a polished wooden plaque. This involves assessing the material properties of the wood and the embossing effect to ensure they look natural and maintain the logo's legibility.
Question: Does the 'Sumo Digital' logo appear as a naturally embossed seal on a polished wooden plaque without any loss of detail or unnatural textures?
