It checks for signs of stretching, compression, or unnatural curvature that would break visual credibility.",
      "question": "Do the man's limbs and torso maintain proportional relationships and natural joint articulation despite stylization?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining plausible material representation in the exaggerated clothing, this question assesses whether the man’s tuxedo and woman’s fur jacket retain realistic fabric behavior—such as folds, sheen, and texture—even when stylized. It specifically checks for flatness, lack of depth, or unnatural edge sharpness that could indicate loss of detail.",
      "question": "Are the textures of the tuxedo and fur jacket rendered with sufficient detail and depth to appear physically plausible despite stylization?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of retaining legible elements in the simplified background, this question examines whether the linear motifs of the FIA Prize Giving 2013 logo and sponsor names (Philips, Volkswagen, Michelin) are still recognizable and correctly aligned. It checks for excessive abstraction or distortion that might make logos unidentifiable.",
      "question": "Are the FIA logo and sponsor names clearly visible and correctly formed within the simplified linear background design?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of creating a continuous and symmetrical gold ribbon-like border, this question evaluates whether the border forms a complete, seamless frame around the central image without gaps, overlapping issues, or uneven thickness. It ensures the decorative element is visually coherent and well-integrated.",
      "question": "Is the gold ribbon-like border fully closed, evenly shaped, and consistently thick around the entire perimeter of the stamp?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of realistic embossing on the blue envelope, this question checks whether the minimalist pattern of the event logo appears raised with consistent shading and depth, avoiding flat or overly sharp edges that suggest digital artifacting. It also verifies that the envelope surface has uniform texture and no clipping artifacts.",
      "question": "Does the embossed logo on the blue envelope show consistent depth, soft shadows, and surface texture without appearing flat or artificially rendered?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of natural integration of the stamp onto the envelope, this question evaluates whether the stamp casts a subtle shadow and appears adhered to the surface, rather than floating or clipped. It checks for proper perspective alignment and lighting continuity between the stamp and envelope.",
      "question": "Is the stamp positioned with appropriate shadowing and perspective to appear physically attached to the envelope surface?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of anatomical correctness in stylized figures, this question specifically targets the hands of both individuals—checking for correct finger count (five per hand), natural hand shape, and absence of distorted or missing digits. It ensures stylization does not compromise basic biological plausibility.",
