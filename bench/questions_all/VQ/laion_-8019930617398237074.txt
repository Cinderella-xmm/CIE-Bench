Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The instruction requires converting the woman in a white gown into a romantic postcard by applying asymmetrical floral patterns and pastel lace overlay. This involves adding decorative elements to the dress and background, which may affect the original texture and structure of the gown. Attention must be paid to whether these additions are seamlessly integrated without distorting the fabric or introducing unnatural textures.
-Sub requirement 1: Add asymmetrical floral patterns and pastel lace overlay to the gown and surrounding area; evaluate whether these added elements maintain natural texture, avoid artificial edges, and preserve the structural coherence of the original dress.

-<Thinking Process 2>: The pose of the woman needs to be adjusted to appear as if she is gently holding a bouquet. This involves modifying her hand position and possibly adding a bouquet. The change in hand posture must remain anatomically accurate, with correct finger count and natural joint alignment. The addition of the bouquet must not cause unnatural distortion in the arm or hand.
-Sub requirement 2: Modify the hand position and add a bouquet; assess whether the hand shape is anatomically correct (no extra fingers, natural curvature), and whether the bouquet is proportionally consistent with the hand and body.

-<Thinking Process 3>: Watercolor techniques in light pink and cream should be applied to stylize the image. This implies blending soft color washes over the original image, potentially affecting skin tone, fabric appearance, and background. The watercolor effect must not obscure fine details or create unnatural gradients that break the visual continuity.
-Sub requirement 3: Apply watercolor effects in light pink and cream; evaluate whether the color application preserves fine details, avoids abrupt transitions, and maintains a natural blend across skin, dress, and background.

-<Thinking Process 4>: The final output should resemble a postcard with embossed edges and placed in a delicate paper sleeve. This involves framing the image with a border and adding a paper-like sleeve around it. These elements must not distort the central figure or introduce visible seams or misalignments.
-Sub requirement 4: Add embossed edges and paper sleeve; check whether the frame is uniformly applied, edges are smooth and consistent, and the sleeve does not interfere with the composition or introduce visual artifacts.

-<Thinking Process 5>: The overall transformation must preserve the realism of the original image while introducing artistic stylization. This includes maintaining the integrity of the veil, floral crown, and dress silhouette while integrating new elements. Any changes must not alter the physical plausibility of the scene.
-Sub requirement 5: Maintain structural consistency of the original elements (veil, floral crown, dress); verify that all added or modified components align spatially and visually with the original anatomy and proportions.

Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding asymmetrical floral patterns and pastel lace overlay to the gown and surrounding area, this question evaluates whether the added floral and lace elements integrate naturally with the original dress material. Specifically, it checks for seamless blending, absence of sharp edges, and preservation of fabric texture.
Question: Are the floral patterns and lace overlay smoothly blended into the gown without visible seams or unnatural texture disruptions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adjusting the hand pose to hold a bouquet, this question focuses on the anatomical accuracy of the hand and the proportional relationship between the hand and the bouquet. It checks for correct number of fingers, natural curvature, and realistic grip.
Question: Does the hand show five fingers with natural positioning and no deformation, and is the bouquet held in a physically plausible manner?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of applying watercolor techniques in light pink and cream, this question examines whether the color application maintains detail fidelity and avoids unnatural gradients or smudging. It specifically looks at how the colors interact with skin, fabric, and background.
Question: Are the watercolor effects evenly distributed without obscuring facial features, dress details, or creating harsh color boundaries?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding embossed edges and a paper sleeve, this question evaluates the visual integrity of the frame and sleeve. It checks for uniformity, smoothness, and proper alignment with the central image.
Question: Are the embossed edges consistently applied around the image, and is the paper sleeve positioned without overlapping or distorting the main subject?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving structural consistency of original elements like the veil, floral crown, and dress, this question checks whether the modifications respect the original proportions and spatial relationships. It ensures that no element appears stretched, misplaced, or geometrically inconsistent.
Question: Is the veil still attached correctly to the head, the floral crown intact and properly positioned, and the dress silhouette preserved without warping or distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
