-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction involves transforming the muscular character into three distinct historical figures of strength while keeping the head consistent. This requires replacing or modifying the body’s attire and posture across three eras: Antiquity (Ancient Greek wrestler with mythological armor), Feudal Era (knight in heavy plate armor with a sword), and Modern Era (Olympic weightlifter with barbell). The original image shows a highly stylized, muscular male figure in a dynamic pose with arms outstretched, wearing minimal clothing (briefs with belt), and no visible facial details due to darkness. The transformation must preserve the core structure—especially the head—and ensure that added elements (armor, weapons, clothing) are proportionally accurate, texturally plausible, and geometrically coherent. The key perceptual quality concerns include maintaining structural consistency between the original anatomy and new attire, avoiding distortions in limbs or joints when adding bulky gear, ensuring materials like metal armor or fabric appear natural, and preserving fine details such as muscle definition beneath clothing or armor. Additionally, postures must remain physically rational for each role (e.g., knight holding a sword without unnatural arm extension).

-Sub requirement 1: When replacing the torso and limbs with Ancient Greek mythological armor, evaluate whether the armor conforms to anatomical proportions and does not introduce distorted shapes or unnatural overlaps with the underlying musculature.
-Sub requirement 2: In the Feudal Era version, assess whether the heavy plate armor is structurally coherent, with correct joint articulation and material texture, and whether the large sword is held in a physically plausible position without bending or floating limbs.
-Sub requirement 3: For the Modern Era depiction, check if the barbell is positioned correctly across the shoulders, maintaining balance and realistic weight distribution, and whether the lifting posture aligns with biomechanics.
-Sub requirement 4: Verify that the head remains consistent across all three versions in terms of shape, size, and facial features, without deformation or mismatched proportions relative to the transformed bodies.
-Sub requirement 5: Ensure that all added elements (armor, weapons, clothing) have natural textures and do not exhibit artifacts such as jagged edges, inconsistent shading, or missing fine details.
-Sub requirement 6: Confirm that hand structures in all versions retain five fingers, proper ergonomic form, and natural joint alignment, especially where hands grip objects like swords or barbells.
-Sub requirement 7: Evaluate overall composition and layout of each scene to ensure visual credibility—such as correct perspective, shadowing, and spatial relationship between character and props.

Q1:  
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the torso and limbs with Ancient Greek mythological armor, this question evaluates whether the armor integrates naturally with the original muscular structure without distorting anatomical proportions. The armor should not overlap incorrectly or cause unnatural bulges or gaps in the body's silhouette, especially around the chest, shoulders, and arms.  
Question: Does the Ancient Greek-style armor fit the character’s torso and limbs without distorting muscle contours or creating unnatural gaps or overlaps?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2:  
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding heavy plate armor and a sword in the Feudal Era version, this question checks whether the armor maintains structural coherence at joints (elbows, knees, shoulders) and whether the sword is held in a physically plausible manner without causing limb deformation or floating effects.  
Question: Are the joints of the armored limbs articulated properly, and is the sword held in a position that does not bend or stretch the arm beyond natural limits?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3:  
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of depicting the character as an Olympic weightlifter with a barbell across the shoulders, this question evaluates whether the barbell is positioned correctly and symmetrically, and whether the posture reflects realistic weight-bearing mechanics without exaggerated or collapsed spine alignment.  
Question: Is the barbell placed evenly across the shoulders with both hands gripping it in a balanced stance, and is the back posture upright and stable?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4:  
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining head consistency across all versions, this question assesses whether the head retains its original shape, size, and facial structure relative to the transformed body, particularly in terms of scale and alignment with the neck and shoulders.  
Question: Is the head proportionally aligned with the neck and upper torso in all three versions without appearing oversized, undersized, or misaligned?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5:  
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of ensuring natural textures and absence of artifacts in added elements, this question focuses on the hands, which are critical interaction points with props. It checks whether the number of fingers is correct, the hand shape is ergonomic, and there are no unnatural deformations or missing details when gripping objects.  
Question: Do the hands in all three versions have exactly five fingers, proper joint curvature, and natural grip on the sword or barbell without distortion or extra digits?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6:  
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of evaluating overall composition and visual credibility, this question examines whether the lighting, shadows, and spatial relationships between the character and props (armor, sword, barbell) appear coherent and grounded in physical plausibility.  
Question: Are the shadows and highlights on the armor, clothing, and props consistent with a single light source and do they enhance the three-dimensional appearance without creating floating or disconnected elements?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
