      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the antique map into a scroll form floating above a stylized ocean, evaluate whether the structural transformation maintains geometric coherence and natural curvature. The original map is flat with grid lines and landmasses; converting it into a scroll requires bending without tearing or unnatural warping. This affects realism and visual credibility.",
      "question": "Does the unfurled scroll form of the map maintain smooth, continuous curvature without jagged edges or distorted grid lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of developing the compass into a fictional golden ship's wheel with elaborate engravings, assess whether the transformation preserves material consistency and structural plausibility. The original compass has a circular face with a star-shaped needle and decorative border. Converting it to a ship’s wheel must retain metallic texture and avoid mismatched proportions or broken spokes.",
      "question": "Are the spokes of the ship's wheel evenly spaced, structurally intact, and consistent in thickness and metallic texture with the original compass material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding miniature explorers as silhouettes on the map, evaluate whether these figures are proportionally correct, positioned logically, and integrated without disrupting the map’s surface. Their placement should follow motion cues and not overlap illegible text or distort terrain features.",
      "question": "Are the silhouettes of the explorers clearly distinguishable, proportionally small relative to the map scale, and placed along plausible travel paths without overlapping key geographical labels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating elegant vintage serif typography for the title and captions, assess whether the text appears legible, stylistically consistent with the antique theme, and properly layered over the image without obscuring critical details like coastlines or compass markings.",
      "question": "Is the typography aligned with the vintage aesthetic, free from pixelation or blurring, and positioned so that it does not obscure major elements such as the compass or continental outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of marking historical routes with vibrant red dotted lines, evaluate whether these lines follow logical maritime paths across the map, remain consistent in thickness and spacing, and do not intersect or overwrite important features like islands or cities.",
      "question": "Do the red dotted lines form continuous, non-overlapping paths across the map that align with known historical exploration routes and avoid cutting through landmasses or key symbols?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
