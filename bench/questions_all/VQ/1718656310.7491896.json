      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the woman’s wings into delicate stained glass with woodland flora motifs, evaluate whether the new wing design maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows large, translucent butterfly-like wings with a natural texture. The editing instruction requires replacing this with stained glass-style wings featuring floral patterns. This transformation involves material and texture changes that could introduce artifacts or distortions if not carefully rendered. The question checks for unnatural textures, broken geometric shapes, or inconsistencies in light transmission through the wings.",
      "question": "Do the stained glass wings feature consistent, smooth patterns without jagged edges or pixelated textures, and do they appear to transmit light naturally as if made of glass?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reimagining the dress as woven from leaves and vines with iridescent beads, assess whether the material transformation preserves natural appearance and fine detail. The original image shows a patterned sleeveless dress with fabric texture. The edited version must replace this with organic materials like leaves and vines while maintaining realistic proportions and surface details. This change risks introducing artificial textures or unnatural layering. The question focuses on material authenticity and structural consistency.",
      "question": "Is the dress composed of leaf-like and vine-like elements that maintain natural curvature, shading, and thickness, with no visible seams or synthetic textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of altering the background to an enchanted forest with mist-draped ancient trees, fireflies, and glowing mushrooms, evaluate whether the background integration is seamless and visually credible. The original background is a soft-focus forest scene. The edit introduces new elements such as magical lighting and bioluminescent features. These additions must blend naturally without creating abrupt transitions or inconsistent lighting. The question checks for visual coherence between foreground and background.",
      "question": "Are the glowing mushrooms and twinkling fireflies integrated into the background with consistent lighting and depth, avoiding floating or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring the overall realism and natural appearance of the figure, particularly regarding hand anatomy and posture, evaluate whether the hands remain anatomically correct after editing. The original image shows the woman’s hands resting on rocks. The editing may affect hand shape due to scaling or blending. The question ensures the number of fingers does not exceed five, joints are properly aligned, and skin texture remains natural.",
      "question": "Do both hands show five fingers each with natural joint alignment, smooth skin texture, and no distortion or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility in the character’s pose and proportions, evaluate whether the limbs and body maintain physical rationality. The original image shows a seated position with one leg crossed over the other. After editing, especially with added wings and altered clothing, there is risk of limb stretching, misalignment, or unnatural angles. The question checks for proportionality and ergonomic plausibility.",
      "question": "Are the legs positioned in a physically plausible seated posture with natural knee and ankle angles, and no elongation or compression of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
