    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the porcelain cup and saucer into a mythical phoenix egg, evaluate whether the overall shape transition from a cup and saucer to an egg-like form maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original cup has a cylindrical body with a handle and a flat saucer; the transformation must preserve smooth curvature and proportional balance without geometric distortion or unnatural bulging.",
      "question": "Does the transformed object maintain a continuous, symmetrical egg-like shape with no visible breaks, jagged edges, or misaligned contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of evolving floral patterns into vibrant feather-like designs, assess whether the texture and pattern transitions appear natural and coherent. The original floral motifs are detailed and colorful; the new feather designs must retain similar detail density and color vibrancy without introducing pixelation, blurring, or artificial textures.",
      "question": "Are the feather-like patterns seamlessly integrated into the surface, with consistent line thickness, shading, and color gradients matching the original level of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the handle into an ornate wing, evaluate whether the wing structure is anatomically plausible and proportionally aligned with the rest of the object. The original handle is curved and attached at the side; the wing must emerge naturally from that position without appearing detached, warped, or unnaturally scaled.",
      "question": "Is the wing-shaped handle smoothly connected to the body of the egg, with realistic feather layers and no visible gaps or distortions in its curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of altering the saucer's rim into a decorative nest with jewel-like accents, assess whether the nest structure appears physically rational and structurally sound. The original saucer has a flat circular edge; the nest must curve upward naturally, with materials resembling twigs or fibers, and embedded jewels should reflect light realistically without floating or misalignment.",
      "question": "Does the nest-like rim have a layered, organic structure with consistent material texture and properly placed jewel accents that do not appear displaced or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of embedding glowing embers within the patterns that radiate a mystical aura, evaluate whether the glow effects are integrated naturally into the design. The embers must emit soft, diffused light without creating harsh halos, overexposure, or unnatural brightness that disrupts surrounding details.",
      "question": "Do the glowing embers produce a subtle luminous effect that enhances the patterns without causing blurring, color bleeding, or unnatural highlights on adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
