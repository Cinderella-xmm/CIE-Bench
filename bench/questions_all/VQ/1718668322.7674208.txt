Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the futuristic outfit into a sleek metal armor suit with chrome and titanium finishes, evaluate whether the material properties of the suit in the edited image reflect realistic metallic textures. Focus on the shoulder and chest areas where the original fabric-like texture has been replaced with armor. Check if the surface shows consistent reflections, highlights, and depth typical of polished metal, without unnatural glossiness or flatness.
Question: Do the shoulder and chest armor sections display realistic metallic sheen with proper light reflection and depth, avoiding flat or overly shiny surfaces?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the suit’s contours with articulated joints for flexibility, assess whether the joint areas (such as at the shoulders and elbows) retain natural human proportions and mechanical plausibility. Evaluate whether the armor follows anatomical structure and allows for believable movement, avoiding rigid or misaligned segments that suggest structural inconsistency.
Question: Are the joint areas of the armor aligned with the underlying anatomy and free from geometric distortions or unnatural gaps?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing vibrant hair with flowing strands of polished wires in metallic blue and yellow hues, evaluate the hair replacement in terms of material consistency and physical behavior. Check whether the wire-like strands maintain a coherent flow, exhibit metallic luster, and follow natural hair dynamics such as gravity and layering, without appearing stiff or disconnected.
Question: Do the metallic hair strands appear as continuous, flowing wires with consistent color gradients and reflective properties, without breaking or clumping unnaturally?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of positioning the figure in a minimalist gray environment for stark contrast, evaluate whether the background is uniformly gray and devoid of distracting elements, ensuring visual focus remains on the subject. Assess if the lighting and shadows are consistent with the new environment and do not introduce conflicting cues from the original setting.
Question: Is the background a uniform, neutral gray tone with no visible remnants of the original setting or inconsistent lighting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving structural coherence and visual credibility during transformation, assess whether the overall composition maintains balance between the character and the environment. Check if the proportions of the armor, hair, and body remain consistent with human scale and if there are no visible artifacts such as jagged edges, texture mismatches, or transparency errors at the boundaries of modified regions.
Question: Are all edited regions—armor, hair, and background—seamlessly integrated with smooth transitions and no visible artifacts like pixelation or mismatched edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
