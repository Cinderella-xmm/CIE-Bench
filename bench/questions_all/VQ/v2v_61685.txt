Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the dynamic skate park moment into a Swiss Design poster while maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility, we need to assess if the simplified human figures and background tent retain their structural integrity and natural appearance.
Question: Do the simplified human figures and the background tent maintain their structural coherence without introducing unnatural geometric shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of restricting colors to existing blues, whites, and the man's green shirt as an accent, we need to verify if these color restrictions have been applied correctly without affecting the overall authenticity and natural appearance.
Question: Are the colors restricted only to blues, whites, and the man's green shirt, and do they appear natural without introducing any unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement of integrating 'SKATE FOR ALL' in a bold, clean sans serif typeface across the upper cloudy sky region, we need to ensure that the text integration does not disrupt the visual plausibility and natural appearance of the sky.
Question: Does the text 'SKATE FOR ALL' integrate seamlessly into the upper cloudy sky region without disrupting the natural appearance of the clouds?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of ensuring the proportion and physical rationality of each element, we need to confirm that the human figures and objects like skateboards remain proportionate and physically plausible after the transformation.
Question: Are the proportions of the human figures and skateboards maintained realistically, avoiding any distortion or unnatural scaling?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the sub requirement of avoiding the introduction of artifacts such as unnatural textures and loss of details, we need to evaluate if the fine details of the skateboards and clothing are preserved during the transformation.
Question: Have the fine details of the skateboards and clothing been preserved without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of detail?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
