      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the tiger mask into a paper-cut style, this question evaluates whether the texture and shape of the tiger’s face have been transformed into flat, clean-edged layers without introducing jagged lines, irregular contours, or unnatural layer separation. The focus is on maintaining structural coherence between the eyes, nose, and mouth regions under the new artistic style.",
      "question": "Are the edges of the tiger’s face cleanly defined with uniform thickness and no pixelated or broken lines indicating poor rendering?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of exaggerating the stripes and whiskers, this question checks whether the increased size and boldness of these features maintain anatomical plausibility and symmetry. Over-enlargement could cause distortion in the facial structure, such as misaligned stripes or whiskers extending beyond the jawline in an unnatural way.",
      "question": "Do the exaggerated stripes and enlarged whiskers remain symmetrically aligned and proportionally consistent with the rest of the tiger’s facial structure?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the kimono into layered paper panels, this question assesses whether the fabric appears segmented into distinct, non-overlapping layers with clear boundaries and consistent thickness, avoiding floating or misaligned sections that break the illusion of layered paper.",
      "question": "Are the kimono panels clearly separated into distinct layers with clean edges and no overlapping or floating segments that suggest improper layering?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding gold foil cherry blossoms, this question evaluates whether the metallic elements have a reflective quality that matches the lighting direction and surface properties of the surrounding fabric, without appearing as bright, isolated spots or unnatural glares.",
      "question": "Do the gold foil elements exhibit consistent reflectivity and blend naturally with the surrounding floral pattern without harsh highlights or floating fragments?",
