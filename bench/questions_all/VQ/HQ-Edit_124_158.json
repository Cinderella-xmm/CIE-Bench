      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the lounging cat into a whimsical miniature scene inside a shadow box, evaluate whether the cat’s form and proportions remain consistent with its original structure when encased in a 3D-rendered environment. The editing involves scaling or repositioning the cat within a new context, so it is essential to check if the cat's body shape, limbs, and facial features retain anatomical accuracy and avoid distortion.",
      "question": "Does the cat maintain natural proportions and anatomical structure without visible stretching, compression, or deformation in the shadow box scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of turning the settee into a regal throne, assess whether the transformation preserves the original furniture’s structural integrity and material realism. The red velvet upholstery and wooden frame must be consistent with vintage design, and any added elements (like gilded embellishments) should not introduce unnatural textures or breaks in geometry.",
      "question": "Are the materials of the settee (velvet and wood) rendered with realistic textures and consistent lighting, showing no signs of pixelation, mismatched shading, or artificial seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of fabricating velvet curtains framing the backdrop, evaluate whether the newly added curtains are visually coherent with the scene’s lighting and depth. The curtains should have natural folds, appropriate shadows, and match the color palette and texture style of the existing environment to ensure visual credibility.",
      "question": "Do the velvet curtains appear physically plausible with correct fold patterns, soft shadows, and seamless integration into the background without floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of surrounding the scene with tiny gilded columns, evaluate whether these columns are proportionally scaled relative to the cat and settee, and whether their material (gold finish) appears consistent with the lighting and reflections in the scene. Structural coherence is critical—columns should not intersect incorrectly or appear flat.",
      "question": "Are the gilded columns properly scaled, positioned with correct perspective, and rendered with reflective metallic surfaces that match the ambient light without artifacts like blurring or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding small hanging portraits of mice as part of the gilded kingdom theme, evaluate whether these portraits are placed logically within the scene, with proper depth and scale. They must not appear pasted-on or distorted, and their content (mice faces) should be clearly defined and free from noise or blurring.",
      "question": "Are the hanging mouse portraits clearly visible, correctly sized relative to the scene, and mounted with realistic shadows and string attachments without visual glitches or texture errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
