      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the pots to include embossed tribal patterns, this involves altering the surface texture and design of the ceramic pots located on the wooden shelves along the left wall. The editing must preserve the natural appearance of the pottery material (clay or terracotta) while adding detailed patterns. Attention should be paid to whether the added patterns appear physically plausible, conform to the curvature of the pots, and do not introduce unnatural textures, jagged edges, or inconsistent shading that would break the visual coherence of the scene.",
      "question": "Do the embossed tribal patterns on the ceramic pots maintain consistent texture and depth with the original material, without visible artifacts such as floating lines or distorted geometry?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of cartoonizing the vibrant dress with expanded motifs, this involves stylizing the woman’s dress (located on the right side of the image) by exaggerating its patterns and colors in a cartoon-like manner. This transformation must preserve the overall shape and silhouette of the dress while enhancing the design elements. The key concern is whether the cartoonization introduces unnatural distortions in fabric folds, color gradients, or pattern continuity, or whether it disrupts the realism of the figure's proportions.",
      "question": "Are the expanded motifs on the dress proportionally consistent with the garment’s structure, and do they avoid unnatural stretching or breaking of fabric lines?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the bread and cucumber into adorable character forms, this involves reimagining the food items on the wooden plate placed on the stove (bottom-left area). The bread loaves and cucumber slice are to be modified into anthropomorphic characters. This requires evaluating whether the transformation maintains physical plausibility—such as realistic body proportions, facial features that align with the original shapes, and textures that still resemble baked goods and vegetables. The question checks for distortions like misshapen limbs, inconsistent lighting, or texture mismatches.",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using textured cardstock with blank writing sections, this implies a change in the presentation format of the final output from a digital image to a physical postcard layout. While this does not directly affect the image content, it influences how the edited elements are framed. The evaluation focuses on whether the composition of each vignette (pots, dress, food) remains visually coherent when isolated into separate postcards, and whether the boundaries of each section respect the original spatial relationships and avoid clipping or distortion at edges.",

Specifically, the interaction between the woman’s arms (visible on the right), the stove, and surrounding objects must remain physically rational. For example, if her hand is involved in any action (e.g., holding a utensil), the number of fingers, joint angles, and shadows must be anatomically accurate and consistent with the lighting.",
