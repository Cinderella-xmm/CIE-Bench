Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the tank into a giant LEGO structure using olive and dark green bricks, evaluate whether the material transformation maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original tank has a metallic, painted surface with defined edges and textures. Replacing it with LEGO bricks requires consistent brick patterns, proper alignment, and realistic scale to avoid unnatural textures or broken geometry.
Question: Are the olive and dark green LEGO bricks covering the tank's body uniformly aligned and textured, without visible gaps, misaligned blocks, or distorted shapes that break the geometric structure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the tiger decal with colorful LEGO plates forming a whimsical tiger pattern, assess whether the new design integrates naturally with the LEGO construction. The original decal is a flat, painted graphic on the front hull; replacing it with LEGO plates must preserve the tigerâ€™s recognizable features while maintaining color consistency and shape accuracy.
Question: Does the colorful LEGO tiger pattern on the front hull maintain the correct proportions and facial features of the original tiger decal, without distortion or missing elements such as eyes, teeth, or stripes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using textured LEGO bricks for the tread details, evaluate whether the treads retain their mechanical realism while being reimagined in LEGO form. The original treads have deep, interlocking rubber-like textures; the LEGO version must mimic this depth and spacing without appearing flat or incorrectly scaled.
Question: Do the LEGO treads exhibit consistent, detailed texture resembling real tank tracks, with no flattened sections or incorrect spacing between the individual tread segments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of positioning the structure on a smooth wooden platform, assess whether the base supports the LEGO tank realistically. The original tank rests on gravel within a wooden frame; changing this to a smooth wooden surface must not introduce floating elements or unnatural shadows.
Question: Is the LEGO tank fully supported by a smooth, continuous wooden platform that matches the surrounding ground level, with no floating or misaligned edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a back panel of green LEGO bricks mimicking foliage, evaluate whether the background enhancement appears natural and structurally plausible. The original background consists of trees and grass; replacing part of it with LEGO bricks must not create an abrupt transition or unrealistic texture.
Question: Does the green LEGO brick back panel blend seamlessly with the surrounding environment, showing no sharp edges, unnatural color shifts, or textural inconsistencies compared to the real foliage?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
