      "thinking_process": "The sub requirement of avoiding unnatural textures and loss of details necessitates examining if the fine details of the butterfly, such as the patterns on its wings and the texture of its body, are preserved in the 3D model.",
      "question": "Have the fine details, such as the patterns on the wings and the texture of the body, been preserved without any loss or distortion in the 3D model?",
