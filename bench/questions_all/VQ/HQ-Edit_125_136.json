      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of simplifying shapes while retaining the astronaut, Moon, and ISS elements, evaluate whether the vector-style transformation maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The astronaut’s suit must retain its geometric integrity, especially around the helmet, joints, and life support system. Any flattening or simplification should not distort proportions or introduce unnatural edges.",
      "question": "Are the shapes of the astronaut's helmet, suit segments, and life support pack simplified but still geometrically consistent with their original forms without jagged or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to texturize the spacesuit detail while using a clean vector graphic style, assess whether the texture application preserves natural material appearance. The texture should enhance realism without introducing artificial patterns, such as repeating grid lines or pixelation that contradict the fabric-like nature of a spacesuit.",
      "question": "Does the texture applied to the spacesuit appear uniformly distributed and physically plausible, without unnatural repetition or artificial pattern artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the instruction to use flat colors with high contrast and accent hues like gold, evaluate whether the color scheme maintains visual credibility. Gold accents should be applied only to intended elements (e.g., patches, trim) and not disrupt the existing dark blue and white palette. Color transitions should be sharp and clean without bleeding or haloing.",
      "question": "Are the accent gold colors confined to specific design elements (such as patch borders or connectors) and do they blend naturally without color bleed into adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the requirement to illustrate step-by-step movements with arrows indicating direction, assess whether the added directional arrows are proportionally accurate and spatially coherent with the astronaut’s position relative to the ISS. Arrows should not intersect improperly with the astronaut or station components and must follow logical motion paths.",
      "question": "Do the directional arrows show clear movement from the astronaut toward the ISS without overlapping or distorting the astronaut’s limbs or the station structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the instruction to include labeled steps (\"Step 1: Prepare\", \"Step 2: Navigate\", \"Step 3: Operate\") along the bottom, evaluate whether the text placement avoids obscuring key visual elements (like the lunar surface or ISS). Text should be legible, aligned horizontally, and integrated without casting shadows or warping surrounding areas.",
      "question": "Is the text positioned at the bottom edge of the image without covering critical parts of the Moon or ISS, and is it clearly readable without distortion or shadow effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
