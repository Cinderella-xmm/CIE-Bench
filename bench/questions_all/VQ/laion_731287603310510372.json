      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that shadowy textures and angular lines should not distort the man’s head or shoulders, this question evaluates whether the added noir-style background elements have caused any visible warping, edge artifacts, or unnatural shadows around the contours of the man’s face, cap, or neck. It checks for structural consistency and visual credibility in the integration of new textures.",
      "question": "Are the edges of the man’s head, cap, and shoulders sharp and unaltered by the added shadowy textures or angular lines, with no visible distortion or ghosting?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the title \"The Gray Mystery\" must be placed without obscuring key features, this question assesses whether the text is positioned appropriately—likely above or beside the subject—without overlapping the face, cap, or shirt, and whether its font style and size are proportionally coherent with the image scale.",
      "question": "Is the title \"The Gray Mystery\" positioned outside the man’s face and cap area, and does it not partially cover or obscure any facial features or clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that abstract silhouettes of a cityscape and magnifying glass must not create geometric inconsistencies, this question checks whether these added elements blend naturally into the background without causing visual conflicts such as misaligned lines, floating shapes, or unnatural layering near the man’s head and shoulders.",
      "question": "Do the silhouettes of the cityscape and magnifying glass appear integrated into the background without intersecting or distorting the man’s head or shoulders, and do they maintain consistent depth relative to the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the sepia tone must preserve natural skin and fabric textures, this question evaluates whether the color grading has caused unnatural discoloration, loss of detail in facial features, or altered the realistic appearance of the gray cap and shirt.",
      "question": "Are the skin tones, facial hair, and fabric textures of the cap and shirt still visible and consistent with their original appearance, without unnatural yellowing or fading due to the sepia effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the gray cap and shirt must retain their material authenticity, this question checks whether the texture of the fabric remains intact, with no artificial smoothing, pixelation, or reflective anomalies introduced by the editing process.",
      "question": "Does the gray cap and shirt display consistent fabric texture and weave pattern, with no visible artifacts such as blurring, noise, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
