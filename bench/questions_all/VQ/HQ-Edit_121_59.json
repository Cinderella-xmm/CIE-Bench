      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the fishing rod with a golden wand, this question evaluates whether the material transformation from realistic fishing rod to golden wand maintains visual coherence. The golden surface must reflect light appropriately and connect seamlessly to the reel and hand. Any unnatural highlights, misaligned edges, or inconsistent color gradients would indicate artifacts.",
      "question": "Does the golden wand have smooth, reflective surfaces with consistent lighting and shadows that match the surrounding environment, and is it properly connected to the reel and the fisherman’s hand without gaps or distortions?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enhancing the texture of the hat and plaid shirt, this question checks whether the increased texture detail remains within natural limits. Over-enhancement can lead to unnatural patterns, jagged edges, or color bleeding. The fabric folds and stitching should still appear plausible.",
      "question": "Are the textures on the hat and plaid shirt visibly enhanced but still consistent with real fabric appearance, with no pixelation, stretching, or broken patterns in the weave or seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding magical ripples from the wand, this question evaluates whether the water disturbance follows physical logic. Ripples should radiate outward in concentric circles, affect the reflection, and not float independently or break the water surface integrity.",
      "question": "Do the magical ripples originate from the tip of the wand and spread outward in continuous, concentric patterns that interact naturally with the water surface and reflections, without floating or disconnected wave segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a distressed wooden frame with embossed pine trees, this question assesses whether the frame integrates naturally into the image. It must cast appropriate shadows, match the lighting direction, and have realistic wood grain and embossing depth.",
      "question": "Is the wooden frame positioned around the image with correct perspective, consistent texture, and shadows that align with the scene’s lighting, and do the embossed pine tree details appear three-dimensional without distortion or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining anatomical accuracy in the semi-cartoon style, this question focuses on the fisherman’s hands and face. The number of fingers should be five per hand, joints should follow ergonomic form, and facial features should not be exaggerated beyond recognition. The reflection must also mirror these features accurately.",
      "question": "Do the fisherman’s hands show five fingers each with natural joint positioning and skin texture, and is his facial structure preserved without distortion in both the original and reflected image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
