      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the crocodile into a pop art masterpiece with bold black outlines, evaluate whether the added outline around the crocodile’s body maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The outline should follow the natural contours of the crocodile without distorting its shape or creating unnatural breaks in geometry, especially around the head, snout, and limbs. This ensures that the stylized effect does not compromise the anatomical integrity of the animal.",
      "question": "Does the bold black outline fully trace the crocodile's form without breaking or misaligning at joints, scales, or facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of saturating the hat and sunglasses with neon colors, assess whether the color saturation of the knitted hat and orange sunglasses remains visually coherent with their original textures and materials. The neon treatment should enhance vibrancy without causing unnatural pixelation, color bleeding, or loss of textile details such as knit patterns or lens reflections.",
      "question": "Are the colors of the hat and sunglasses vividly saturated but still preserving visible texture details like knit stitches and lens reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the crocodile’s scales into repetitive geometric patterns, evaluate whether the transformation from natural scaly skin to stylized geometric shapes retains visual credibility. The pattern should cover the entire visible skin surface uniformly and avoid abrupt transitions, irregular spacing, or distortions that break the continuity of the reptilian texture.",
      "question": "Do the geometric patterns on the crocodile's skin repeat consistently across the neck, back, and limbs without gaps, overlaps, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of emphasizing vibrant contrast in Andy Warhol’s style, assess whether the overall composition maintains balance between the stylized elements (hat, glasses, patterns) and the underlying structure of the crocodile. The high-contrast design should not cause floating elements, misalignment with the body, or unnatural shadowing that suggests depth inconsistency.",
      "question": "Are the hat, sunglasses, and geometric patterns aligned correctly with the crocodile’s head and body, showing no floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining visual plausibility despite stylization, evaluate whether the proportions of the crocodile’s head, eyes, and mouth remain consistent with biological anatomy even after applying artistic effects. The transformation should not exaggerate or shrink features such as the snout, teeth, or jawline in a way that violates physical logic or creates unnatural deformation.",
      "question": "Are the crocodile’s facial features, including the snout, teeth, and eye placement, proportionally accurate and undistorted despite the artistic modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
