Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the knitted striped animal into a mosaic sculpture using glossy ceramic tiles, evaluate whether the material transformation at the body of the animal maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows a knitted texture with visible stitches and soft fabric-like appearance; replacing it with small, glossy ceramic tiles requires assessing if the new material retains the shape and proportions without introducing unnatural textures or broken geometry.
Question: Does the body of the animal consist of small, uniformly sized glossy ceramic tiles arranged in a consistent pattern that follows the contours of the original form without gaps or misalignment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of retaining expressive facial features with precisely cut tiles for eyes and snout, evaluate whether the facial elements (eyes, snout, nose) have been accurately translated into tile form while preserving their original positions, shapes, and expressiveness. The original image has large white eyes with black pupils and a defined snout; these must be rendered in tile form without distortion.
Question: Are the eyes composed of precisely shaped tiles forming distinct white sclera and black pupils, maintaining their original size and position relative to the snout and head?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using vibrant orange and deep black tiles for stripes, assess whether the color transition between stripes is sharp and consistent with the original stripe pattern. The original image has alternating orange and black stripes across the body; this must be preserved in the mosaic version without blurring or inconsistent spacing.
Question: Do the stripes across the body maintain uniform width and spacing, with clear transitions between vibrant orange and deep black tiles that match the original pattern?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of positioning the mosaic piece on a sandy textured platform, evaluate whether the base surface beneath the animal displays a natural sand texture that contrasts appropriately with the smooth tiles. The original image shows the animal standing on wet sand near the shoreline; the edited version must preserve this context with realistic sand grain detail and shadow interaction.
Question: Is the surface beneath the animal a textured sandy platform with visible granular detail and subtle moisture variation, providing a tactile contrast to the smooth mosaic tiles?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts such as unnatural textures and loss of fine details during material transformation, evaluate whether the transition from knitted fabric to ceramic tiles introduces any visual distortions, such as warped edges, incorrect shading, or missing tile details. The limbs and joints must retain their original proportions and smooth curvature without geometric breakage.
Question: Are the limbs and joints of the animal smoothly contoured with no jagged edges, distorted shapes, or missing tiles that would suggest structural inconsistency or rendering errors?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
