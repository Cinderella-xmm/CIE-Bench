      "question": "Are the background figures appropriately simplified with light lines and washes, avoiding unnatural geometric breaks or inconsistencies in their form?",

      "thinking_process": "Evaluating the hand of the woman holding the wine glass under the new watercolor style demands ensuring that the hand retains its structural integrity and ergonomic correctness, avoiding unnatural finger shapes or counts.",
      "question": "Is the woman's hand holding the wine glass composed of five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, avoiding unnatural artifacts or shapes?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "To meet the requirement of maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility, the wine glass held by the woman should retain its transparency and reflective qualities, even within the watercolor style, without appearing flat or losing fine details.",
      "question": "Does the wine glass appear transparent with subtle reflections, consistent with its real-life properties, without losing fine details or becoming overly stylized in the watercolor transformation?",

      "thinking_process": "The placement and interaction between the woman, her table, and surrounding objects need to remain visually credible, avoiding distortions like misplaced shadows, inconsistent lighting, or floating elements after style conversion.",
      "question": "Do the shadows and interactions between the woman, her glass, and the table appear consistent with lighting and spatial positioning, avoiding any visual distortion or floating effects after the watercolor transformation?",
