Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the motorcycle into a sci-fi themed collectible figure, the original motorcycle's body structure (including fuel tank, seat, frame, and wheels) must be modified to include futuristic elements like glowing neon accents. This involves altering surface materials and adding new visual components. The question evaluates whether the addition of neon accents on the motorcycle’s body maintains natural luminosity without introducing unnatural glow artifacts or inconsistent light diffusion that breaks realism.
Question: Are the neon accents added to the motorcycle’s body emitting a consistent, smooth glow without harsh edges or pixelation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the standard wheels with hover wheels, this transformation affects the lower portion of the motorcycle where the tires and rims are located. Hover wheels imply a levitation effect and require removal of physical contact with the ground. The question checks if the wheel design retains geometric integrity and plausible physics, avoiding distorted shapes or missing structural elements such as suspension or hub assemblies.
Question: Do the hover wheels maintain symmetrical, closed geometric forms without visible deformation or broken spokes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of integrating a sleek digital interface into the motorcycle, this involves modifying the handlebar area and dashboard region (currently featuring a single headlight and turn signals). The digital interface must appear integrated into the bike’s structure without overlapping or clipping into adjacent parts. The question assesses whether the digital display has coherent placement and material consistency with surrounding components.
Question: Is the digital interface seamlessly embedded in the front panel without intersecting or obscuring existing elements like the headlight or mirrors?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the motorcycle inside an isometric box labeled “FUTURE RIDER,” this introduces a new container element around the motorcycle. The box must have clean lines, proper perspective alignment, and transparent window sections. The question evaluates whether the box maintains consistent proportions and angular accuracy across all sides, ensuring structural coherence in the isometric view.
Question: Does the isometric box exhibit uniform edge lengths and correct angles, with no skewed faces or misaligned corners?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of including a transparent window showcasing the figure, this involves rendering a clear, distortion-free glass-like surface over part of the box. The transparency should allow full visibility of the motorcycle while preserving depth and reflections. The question checks for any unnatural refraction effects, color shifts, or blurring within the window area.
Question: Is the transparent window free of warping, chromatic aberration, or ghosting that would distort the view of the motorcycle behind it?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
