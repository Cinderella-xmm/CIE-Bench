      "question": "Does the tutu maintain a balanced, layered structure with no visible warping or collapsed sections that suggest digital distortion?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding glitter accents to the costume, assess whether the glitter appears embedded within the fabric texture rather than floating or appearing as isolated, sharp pixels that disrupt material continuity.",
      "question": "Are the glitter elements seamlessly blended into the tutu and bodice, showing natural variation in size and brightness without pixelation or unnatural clumping?",
