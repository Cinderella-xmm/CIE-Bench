      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the entire scene into a miniature diorama inside a glass terrarium, evaluate whether the structural elements such as the hotel building and pool maintain correct proportions and geometric alignment after scaling. The glass enclosure must be visible and logically placed around the scene without distorting the architecture or causing misalignment of edges.",
      "question": "Are the corners and edges of the hotel building preserved with consistent angles and proportions, and is there a clear transparent boundary (glass) enclosing the scene without warping or breaking the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding layered water effects to the pool, assess whether the water appears to have multiple transparent depth layers with coherent refraction and reflection patterns. The presence of swimmers and floating objects should remain visible through the layers without unnatural distortion or color banding.",
      "question": "Do the water layers in the pool show consistent transparency and refraction, allowing visibility of submerged objects and swimmers without jagged edges or color artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of miniaturizing sunbathers and trees, check whether the reduced-scale human figures retain anatomical accuracy (e.g., number of fingers, limb proportions) and whether the trees have intact leaf textures and branch structures. Scaling should not cause blurring or loss of fine detail.",
      "question": "Do the sunbathers on the lounge chairs have correctly proportioned limbs and recognizable clothing details, and do the nearby trees display natural leaf density and branching without pixelation or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of fabricating cascading greenery from the rooftop, verify whether the plants grow downward from the roofline in a gravity-consistent manner, with appropriate shadows and integration into the building's surface. There should be no floating segments or sudden breaks in the foliage.",
      "question": "Does the greenery flowing from the rooftop follow a continuous, downward trajectory with realistic shadowing and attachment points, and does it blend naturally with the buildingâ€™s exterior without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing whimsical beach accessories near the pool edge, determine whether these objects are properly scaled relative to the loungers and people, and whether they are positioned on surfaces (e.g., sand, deck) without overlapping or appearing suspended in mid-air.",
      "question": "Are the beach accessories near the pool edge correctly sized and placed on solid ground, avoiding overlap with people or furniture, and do they have natural material textures (e.g., fabric, plastic)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of positioning floating 3D clouds above the scene, assess whether the clouds have soft edges, volumetric shading, and consistent lighting that matches the direction of sunlight. They should not intersect with the building or appear flat against the sky.",
      "question": "Do the floating 3D clouds exhibit soft gradients and subtle shadows, hover above the building without intersecting its structure, and maintain consistent lighting with the rest of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
