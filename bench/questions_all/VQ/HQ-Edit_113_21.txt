Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of modifying the woman’s position and environment to feature her leaning against a straw hut, evaluate whether the interaction between the woman and the hut maintains structural coherence. The editing involves placing her in a new pose near the hut, so we must check if her posture aligns naturally with the physical structure of the hut (e.g., leaning angle, shadow consistency, spatial relationship). This affects visual credibility and natural appearance.
Question: Does the woman’s body posture while leaning against the hut appear physically plausible, with correct alignment of limbs and no unnatural bending or floating?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of emphasizing beaded jewelry in abstract form, assess whether the transformation of the jewelry into an abstract design preserves material authenticity and avoids artificial textures. The original image shows detailed beadwork; abstracting it should not introduce pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent patterns that break realism.
Question: Are the abstracted beaded jewelry elements rendered with smooth transitions and consistent geometric patterns, without visible artifacts such as blurring or distorted shapes?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of showcasing the woman’s silhouette against a digital grassy landscape, evaluate whether the transition from the original rural setting to a digital background maintains visual coherence. The silhouette must be clearly defined without clipping errors, and the digital landscape should not show mismatched lighting or texture anomalies.
Question: Is the silhouette of the woman cleanly separated from the background with no jagged edges, ghosting, or misaligned contours?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using vivid colors and geometric borders for a cohesive set, evaluate whether the added borders around the postcards are uniform in style, thickness, and color, and do not interfere with the underlying image content. These borders must not overlap or distort elements like facial features or clothing.
Question: Are the geometric borders applied consistently around each postcard without overlapping or distorting the main subject or background elements?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining natural appearance in the woman's attire and accessories, evaluate whether the fabric textures, patterns, and colors remain consistent across all three postcards. Any changes in material rendering (e.g., shiny spots, unnatural sheen) would compromise authenticity.
Question: Do the patterns and textures on the woman’s traditional clothing appear continuous and undistorted across all three versions, with no unexpected highlights or material shifts?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
