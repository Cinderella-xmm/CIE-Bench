      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding facial features (eyes, smile) to the glass surface of the bulb, evaluate whether the facial elements are seamlessly integrated into the transparent glass without altering its refractive qualities or introducing opaque patches. The eyes and mouth should not obscure the internal filament structure unnaturally.",
      "question": "Are the eyes and smile drawn on the glass surface without causing visible distortion or blocking of the internal filament structure?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of attaching arms to the sides of the bulb, assess whether the arms emerge from the metal cage or glass body in a way that respects the bulb’s cylindrical form and does not create floating or disconnected joints. The arms should maintain anatomical proportion and avoid unnatural bends.",
      "question": "Do the arms extend from the bulb body in a way that follows the curvature of the glass and metal cage without appearing detached or geometrically broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of retaining the metal cage structure, check if the wireframe remains continuous and unbroken around the bulb. Any gaps, misaligned loops, or warped wires would compromise the structural integrity and realism of the cage.",
      "question": "Is the metal cage fully intact with all loops connected and symmetrically arranged around the bulb, showing no missing or distorted sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating the bulb character into a vintage laboratory scene, verify that background elements such as gears, dials, and lab tables are positioned at appropriate depths and lit consistently with the foreground bulb. Shadows and reflections should align across the scene.",
      "question": "Do the background elements cast shadows and reflect light in a manner consistent with the direction and intensity of the bulb’s glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying a comic book color palette, examine whether the use of bold primaries and metallic shades enhances the image without causing unnatural color shifts, pixelation, or loss of detail on reflective surfaces like glass or metal.",
      "question": "Are the colors applied evenly across all surfaces (glass, metal, background) without visible banding, oversaturation, or texture degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding text boxes and speech bubbles, confirm that the typography is legible, properly sized, and anchored correctly to the character. The text should not overlap with key elements like the filament or cage wires.",
      "question": "Are the text box and speech bubble positioned so that they do not overlap with the bulb’s internal structure or metal cage, and are they clearly readable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring physical plausibility in poses (arms akimbo, swinging), evaluate whether the character’s limbs are extended in a way that matches human-like biomechanics and does not violate spatial logic, such as limbs passing through solid objects or bending impossibly.",
      "question": "Are the arms positioned in a way that follows natural joint angles and does not intersect with the bulb’s glass or metal cage in an impossible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
