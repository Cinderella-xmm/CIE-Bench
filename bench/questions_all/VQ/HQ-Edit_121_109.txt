Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the hummingbird’s wings into iridescent glass-like structures that shimmer with rainbow colors, this editing involves replacing organic feathers with a non-organic, translucent material. The position is the wing area of the hummingbird, which spans from the shoulder to the tip of the wing in flight. This change affects material authenticity and visual coherence. The question evaluates whether the new wing texture appears physically plausible, with smooth gradients and realistic light refraction typical of glass or crystal, without pixelation, unnatural edges, or inconsistent color distribution.
Question: Do the hummingbird's wings display a seamless, continuous iridescent glass-like texture with natural light reflection and rainbow color gradients, free from jagged edges or artificial-looking patterns?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the hummingbird’s feathers with luminescent petals, this modification targets the body surface of the bird, particularly the chest, back, and head areas. The original image shows dense, layered feathers with defined structure. Replacing them with petal-like elements requires maintaining anatomical plausibility—petals must follow the curvature of the body and not appear misaligned or floating. The evaluation focuses on structural consistency and natural integration of biological and floral forms.
Question: Are the luminescent petals covering the hummingbird’s body arranged in a way that follows the bird’s body contours without gaps, overlaps, or unnatural spacing, and do they exhibit consistent lighting and translucency?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the beak with a crystalline spout exuding floral nectar, this editing targets the front of the hummingbird’s head. The original beak is slender and pointed; replacing it with a crystalline structure introduces a new material (crystal) and function (nectar emission). The question assesses whether the spout maintains proportional size relative to the head, has realistic internal refraction, and emits a visible but natural-looking liquid stream without distortion or floating droplets.
Question: Is the crystalline spout seamlessly integrated into the hummingbird’s head, with realistic internal refraction and a coherent, gravity-consistent flow of nectar emerging from its tip?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the tail with trailing vines and tiny blossoms, this editing targets the posterior end of the bird. In the original image, the tail feathers are symmetrical and fanned. The replacement introduces organic plant elements that must extend naturally from the body and interact with the surrounding environment. The evaluation checks for structural coherence—whether the vines curve plausibly, have proper thickness variation, and are adorned with small flowers that match the garden setting.
Question: Do the trailing vines and blossoms extending from the hummingbird’s tail maintain natural growth patterns, with gradual tapering and evenly spaced flowers, and do they avoid appearing stiff or unnaturally rigid?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the overall transformation of the hummingbird into an ethereal garden spirit, the entire figure must retain visual harmony with the surrounding garden environment. The original scene includes vibrant flora, soft lighting, and a peaceful atmosphere. The edited bird must blend into this context without creating visual dissonance—such as clashing textures, unnatural shadows, or mismatched lighting. This question evaluates holistic integration across shape, material, and lighting.
Question: Does the transformed hummingbird cast a shadow consistent with the ambient lighting direction and intensity, and does its overall appearance harmonize with the surrounding garden elements in terms of color temperature and luminosity?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
