      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the pottery setup into a diorama inside a glass cloche, evaluate whether the addition of the glass cloche affects the overall realism and natural appearance. The cloche must be transparent with smooth edges and consistent reflections, without introducing unnatural textures or distortions in the underlying objects. The cloche should not interfere with the spatial coherence of the original wooden structure.",
      "question": "Is the glass cloche added over the pottery setup transparent, smoothly shaped, and free of visible artifacts such as jagged edges or distorted reflections?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding vibrant patina to the clay pieces, assess whether the coloration applied to the gray clay vases and blocks appears natural and consistent with real-world aging effects. The patina should enhance texture without creating unnatural color patches or violating material plausibility.",
      "question": "Do the clay pieces exhibit a uniform, realistic patina that blends naturally with their original gray tone without abrupt color shifts or artificial-looking highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of including miniature fairies kneading clay among tools, evaluate whether the fairies are proportionally correct relative to the surrounding objects (e.g., clay pots, wooden table), anatomically plausible, and positioned in a physically credible manner (e.g., hands near clay, no floating limbs). Their presence should not disrupt the structural integrity of the scene.",
      "question": "Are the miniature fairies proportionally scaled to the pottery and tools, positioned realistically on or near the table, and anatomically accurate with intact limbs and natural poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating lush moss and tiny flowers around the tabletop edges, determine whether these elements are seamlessly integrated into the scene. The moss and flowers should have natural textures, appropriate spacing, and avoid overlapping or obscuring key structural parts of the wooden table or base.",
      "question": "Are the moss and tiny flowers placed along the edges of the wooden table with natural growth patterns and realistic textures, without covering critical structural components or appearing artificially pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a wooden plaque with engraved artisan details at the base, evaluate whether the plaque is physically plausibleâ€”correctly sized, properly aligned with the base, and featuring legible engravings without distortion. It should not appear disconnected or floating.",
      "question": "Is the wooden plaque attached securely to the base, correctly sized relative to the structure, and does it display clear, readable engravings without warping or unnatural surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
