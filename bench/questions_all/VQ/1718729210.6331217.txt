Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the straw material of the scarecrow with glossy, weather-resistant materials, evaluate whether the texture and appearance of the scarecrow's body (especially arms, torso, and legs) have been altered to reflect a smooth, non-fibrous surface without introducing unnatural sheen or texture inconsistencies. The original image shows a rough, straw-like texture; thus, any replacement must maintain structural coherence while avoiding visual artifacts such as uneven gloss or synthetic-looking patches.
Question: Does the scarecrow’s body exhibit a consistent glossy finish across all areas where straw was replaced, without visible seams, unnatural reflections, or texture mismatches?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of making the hat a detachable candle holder, assess whether the hat maintains its original shape and proportion while incorporating functional elements like a cavity or base suitable for holding a candle. The original hat is conical and made of fabric-like material; modifications should not distort its geometry or introduce physically implausible features such as floating supports or mismatched openings.
Question: Is the hat structurally intact and proportionally consistent with the original, featuring a clearly defined opening at the top that allows for candle placement without distorting its shape?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding LED string lights for accenting, determine whether the lights are integrated into the scene in a way that avoids unnatural glows, misplaced wires, or inconsistent light emission. The original image has ambient lighting from the moon and stars; added lights should blend seamlessly with this illumination without creating harsh highlights or glowing artifacts that contradict the environment.
Question: Are the LED string lights positioned along the scarecrow or packaging in a way that emits soft, localized light without causing unnatural bright spots, flickering effects, or visible wiring?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of including a decorative crow figurine positioned atop the box, evaluate whether the crow is placed realistically on the packaging structure—without floating, clipping through surfaces, or appearing disproportionately large or small. The original image includes birds in flight, so the added figurine should match their scale and form while maintaining physical plausibility in its pose and orientation.
Question: Is the crow figurine resting stably on the top edge of the box, aligned with gravitational logic, and matching the size and proportions of the birds seen in flight in the background?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the scarecrow into a premium Halloween decor box set, assess whether the overall composition presents a coherent product package with clear boundaries, realistic shadows, and proper depth cues. The original scarecrow stands alone in a field; the edited version must show a defined box structure around it with consistent material properties and no visual breaks between the scarecrow and the packaging.
Question: Does the packaging surrounding the scarecrow have clean edges, consistent material shading, and proper shadow alignment with the light source, indicating a solid, three-dimensional box structure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
