      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Considering the sub requirement that the bananas should retain their structural consistency and visual credibility while being redrawn in a cartoon farm sticker style, we need to ensure that the bananas maintain a natural appearance despite the style change. This involves analyzing the texture, shape, and overall authenticity post-editing.",
      "question": "Do the bananas retain a natural curvature and texture, avoiding any obvious distortion or unnatural shapes after being redrawn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "To evaluate if the wooden base and metal stand maintain their material characteristics and structural consistency post-editing, we need to assess if these elements still appear plausible and do not introduce artifacts or unrealistic textures during the transition into a cartoon style.",
      "question": "Does the wooden base and metal stand preserve their material properties and structural coherence, without introducing unnatural textures or breaking geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the requirement that the new graphic style should provide a warm, chibi-like appearance with bold outlines and a green hill background suitable for children's illustrations, we need to ensure that the visual elements align well with this style, maintaining both charm and clarity.",
      "question": "Are the bold outlines around the bananas and stand clear and consistent, contributing to the chibi-style aesthetic without being overly thick or uneven?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The introduction of a green hill background should complement the main objects (bananas and stand) in terms of proportion and placement, maintaining the visual balance and harmony of the scene.",
      "question": "Does the green hill background integrate seamlessly with the foreground elements, maintaining proportional logic and visual coherence without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Ensuring that the fine details of the bananas, like the tips and edges, remain intact and natural post-editing is crucial for achieving a high-quality final image. Any loss or distortion of detail could lead to a decrease in authenticity and visual appeal.",
      "question": "Have the fine details on the bananas, such as the tips and edges, been preserved in the cartoon redraw, avoiding any loss or distortion that affects the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
