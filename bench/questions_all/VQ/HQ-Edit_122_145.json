Focus on the arms, legs, and torso to check for unnatural bending, elongation, or misalignment.",
      "question": "Are the limbs of the chibi character straight and properly connected at joints, with no visible kinks or disproportionate lengths?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving facial features in chibi style, assess whether the eyes, mouth, and hair retain simplified but anatomically plausible forms. Check for symmetry, correct number of fingers if hands are visible, and absence of texture artifacts.",
      "question": "Does the face of the chibi character have symmetrical eyes and a clearly defined mouth, with no distorted lines or unnatural shading?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enhancing floral patterns and bows with vibrant colors, examine the kimono’s fabric for color uniformity, texture clarity, and absence of pixelation or color bleeding. Ensure that the increased vibrancy does not obscure fine details like individual petals or stitching.",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the kimono clearly visible with sharp edges and no color smudging or pixelation, even after color enhancement?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring physical plausibility in poses, evaluate the hand holding the cherry blossom branch. Check if the fingers are correctly shaped (no more than five), properly curled around the branch, and positioned naturally.",
      "question": "Is the hand holding the cherry blossom branch composed of five fingers with natural curvature and no extra digits or deformed shapes?",

      "question": "Do the falling petals in the dancing pose follow a downward arc consistent with gravity, and are they evenly distributed without clustering or floating above the character?",

      "question": "Are all four chibi figures fully visible and evenly spaced on the magnetic sheet, with no overlapping or cut-off edges?",
