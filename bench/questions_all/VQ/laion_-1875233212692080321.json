      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of evaluating structural consistency and visual credibility when replacing rose petals with a glass perfume bottle, this question checks whether the new bottle integrates naturally into the scene by maintaining proper proportions and alignment with the original floral elements. The shape of the bottle must conform to physical laws (e.g., cylindrical symmetry) and avoid unnatural stretching or compression.",
      "question": "Is the glass bottle positioned such that its base aligns with the original location of the rose petals and does not appear disproportionately large or small compared to surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement assessing the etched petal patterns on the bottle surface, this question evaluates whether the engraved details are rendered with smooth contours and uniform thickness, avoiding jagged edges or broken lines that would suggest digital artifacts or poor resolution.",
      "question": "Are the petal etchings on the bottle surface continuous and evenly spaced, without visible gaps, pixelation, or irregular line breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement regarding the glossy gold rose-shaped cap, this question examines whether the material properties of the cap—such as reflectivity, highlights, and curvature—are consistent with realistic metal finishes under ambient lighting, ensuring no flat or matte areas that break immersion.",
      "question": "Does the gold rose-shaped cap exhibit realistic reflections and specular highlights that match the light source direction and do not appear overly shiny or uniformly colored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement concerning the interior crimson gradient of the bottle, this question assesses whether the color transition within the liquid is smooth and free from banding or abrupt changes, which are common indicators of low-quality image processing or insufficient color depth.",
      "question": "Is the deep crimson gradient inside the bottle smoothly blended across the vertical axis, without visible color bands or uneven transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement about the placement and appearance of the gold logo, this question ensures that the text is sharp, correctly oriented, and integrated into the bottle’s surface without distortion, blur, or misalignment that could compromise readability or realism.",
      "question": "Is the vertical gold logo clearly legible, evenly spaced, and aligned along the side of the bottle without warping, fading, or overlapping with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
