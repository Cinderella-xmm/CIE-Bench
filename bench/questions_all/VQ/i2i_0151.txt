Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility when designing the kite as the main image for cultural paper postcards, judge whether the kite's shape and structure remain intact and plausible after editing.
Question: Does the kite maintain its geometric shape without any distortion or damage?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of avoiding unnatural textures and maintaining material authenticity while converting the image into a paper craft model style, evaluate if the texture of the kite appears natural and consistent with paper material.
Question: Are there any unnatural textures on the kite that do not align with the expected paper material appearance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: No

Q3: 
Thinking process: Focused on the sub requirement of preserving the overall realism and natural appearance during the editing process, analyze whether the kite's color remains consistent and realistic against the sky background.
Question: Is the yellow color of the kite consistent and natural against the sky backdrop, without any unnatural color variance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of retaining the core element's structural consistency and visual credibility, assess if the tail of the kite is properly integrated and visually coherent within the image.
Question: Does the kite's tail appear structurally coherent and smoothly connected to the kite body, without any visible breaks or inconsistencies?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of avoiding the introduction of artifacts and maintaining fine detail integrity, check if the kite string and its appearance are natural and artifact-free.
Question: Is the kite string depicted naturally, free from any artifacts or unrealistic thickness variations?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
