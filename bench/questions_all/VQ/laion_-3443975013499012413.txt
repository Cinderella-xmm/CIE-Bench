Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the wooden material with transparent blue and teal crystals, evaluate whether the new material accurately reflects the original fish carvingâ€™s shape and depth while maintaining structural coherence. The editing involves transforming the entire carved fish into a crystalline form, so it is critical to assess whether the crystal facets follow the contours and scales of the original design without introducing unnatural breaks or misalignments in geometry.
Question: Do the crystal facets on the fish's body follow the natural curves and scale patterns of the original wooden carving without geometric distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using glossy textures to mimic water-like fluidity, assess whether the surface of the crystal sculpture exhibits consistent reflective properties that suggest liquid transparency and smoothness. The reflection should be coherent across the entire fish structure, especially along the fins and tail where curvature is pronounced.
Question: Are the glossy surfaces of the crystal fish uniformly reflective and free from abrupt texture changes or matte patches that break the illusion of fluidity?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving the structural consistency of the original fish design during material transformation, verify that the proportions and spatial relationships between the head, body, fins, and tail remain accurate and undistorted. The spiral form of the fish must maintain its integrity even after conversion to crystal.
Question: Is the spiral shape of the fish preserved in the crystal version, with no stretching, compression, or misalignment of segments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the sculpture on a sleek mirrored pedestal within a minimalist white gallery space, evaluate whether the environment supports the crystal sculpture without visual conflicts. The pedestal should reflect the sculpture clearly, and the background should be clean and neutral, avoiding any elements that distract from the subject.
Question: Does the mirrored pedestal beneath the crystal fish reflect the sculpture accurately, with no visible distortions or missing reflections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts such as unnatural textures or loss of fine details during material replacement, check whether the transition from wood to crystal retains all intricate details like fin ridges, scale lines, and facial features. These details must be faithfully translated into the crystalline form without blurring or simplification.
Question: Are the fine details such as the gill lines, eye sockets, and fin textures clearly preserved in the crystal version without fading or smoothing?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
