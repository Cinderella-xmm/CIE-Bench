      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of embedding sheet music patterns within the orange hues of the butterfly's wings, this edit targets the wing surface texture. The addition must preserve the natural vein structure and color gradients of the monarch’s wings. Any disruption to the wing’s geometry or introduction of unnatural line work would compromise authenticity.",
      "question": "Are the sheet music patterns integrated into the wing’s orange sections without breaking the natural vein lines or causing visible texture artifacts?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of repositioning the butterfly’s antennae to mimic baton motion, this edit modifies the shape and angle of the antennae. The antennae must remain thin, curved, and proportional to the head, maintaining biological accuracy even in animated pose.",
      "question": "Do the antennae extend from the head in a smooth, continuous curve without unnatural kinks, breaks, or disproportionate length?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding new flowers with petal shapes resembling musical notes, this edit introduces new floral elements near the existing coneflower. These petals must retain organic form despite stylization and not appear flat or geometrically inconsistent.",
      "question": "Are the petal shapes of the newly added flowers formed like musical notes but still maintain natural curvature and thickness consistent with real petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of arranging all elements in a circular composition, this edit affects spatial layout. The positioning of the butterfly and surrounding flowers must follow a logical radial flow without overlapping incorrectly or appearing misaligned.",
      "question": "Are the butterfly and surrounding flowers arranged in a balanced circular pattern where each element appears at a plausible distance and angle relative to the others?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question": "Is the title text rendered with smooth, continuous strokes and no visible aliasing or jagged edges along the letterforms?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
