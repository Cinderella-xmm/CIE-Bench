      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the car body with blue and black LEGO bricks while preserving its original shape and proportions, this question evaluates whether the transformation maintains structural coherence and avoids distortion. The original car has a defined front bumper, hood, doors, and roofline. In the edited image, these features must be reconstructed using LEGO bricks without altering the vehicle's silhouette or causing misalignment between parts.",
      "question": "Are the edges and contours of the LEGO car body aligned with the original vehicle’s shape, with no visible gaps, overlapping blocks, or warped sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the emergency lights with red and blue translucent LEGO pieces, this question assesses whether the light elements retain their correct position and appear physically plausible. The original image shows the lights mounted on the roof in a linear array. In the LEGO version, the translucent pieces must match this layout and show appropriate transparency and color without appearing opaque or incorrectly placed.",
      "question": "Are the red and blue translucent LEGO pieces positioned exactly where the original emergency lights were, and do they appear transparent rather than solid or discolored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using beige LEGO bricks for the windows, this question checks whether the replacement of transparent glass with solid-colored bricks introduces unnatural visual effects. The original image shows clear windows allowing visibility into the car’s interior. Using beige bricks would obscure internal details and break visual logic unless justified by LEGO design constraints. This evaluation focuses on whether the window areas appear uniformly colored and lack transparency, potentially distorting perception.",
      "question": "Do the window areas of the LEGO car consist of solid beige bricks without any transparent or see-through elements, making them visually inconsistent with real-world windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of assembling intricate grille and wheel details using smaller LEGO blocks, this question evaluates whether fine structural details are accurately represented. The original car has a detailed front grille with a grid pattern and wheels with hubcaps and treads. In the LEGO version, these elements must be constructed with small blocks that replicate the original complexity without appearing pixelated, fragmented, or misshapen.",
      "question": "Are the grille and wheel components built from small LEGO blocks that maintain the original patterns and shapes, with no missing, misaligned, or distorted pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the LEGO car on a plain matte gray surface, this question assesses whether the background change is clean and free from artifacts. The original image includes a street scene with buildings and shadows. Replacing this with a neutral gray surface should not introduce seams, lighting inconsistencies, or floating elements. The surface must support the LEGO car without conflicting with its shadows or perspective.",
      "question": "Is the LEGO car resting on a flat, uniform matte gray surface with no visible seams, texture mismatches, or lighting inconsistencies compared to the car’s shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
