      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the cheetah figures into sleek, gold-finished perfume bottles while maintaining their poses, this involves a material transformation from ceramic-like spotted fur to polished gold metal. The editing targets are the two cheetah sculptures (left and right), specifically their body surfaces, texture, and reflective properties. This change must preserve the original seated posture and proportions without distorting anatomy or introducing unnatural reflections or surface inconsistencies. The evaluation focuses on whether the new gold finish appears physically plausible, with consistent metallic sheen and no visible artifacts such as pixelation or color bleeding.",
      "question": "Are the gold-finished surfaces of both cheetah figures smooth, reflective, and free of unnatural textures or patches that suggest digital artifacting?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the botanical center with a translucent, green-tinted glass façade cascading downwards, the central vertical elements (the three books) are targeted for replacement. These elements originally feature printed palm leaf patterns on a white background. The new element must be visually coherent in shape and size with the original book spines but now appear as a single flowing, transparent structure with a green tint and downward cascade effect. This requires evaluating whether the new glass form maintains geometric continuity and transparency without jagged edges or inconsistent lighting effects.",
      "question": "Does the translucent green-tinted glass façade maintain clean, continuous edges and realistic light transmission without visible distortion or abrupt transitions at its boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding minimalist branding along the bases using a chic serif font titled \"Savanna Essence,\" the black rectangular bases beneath each cheetah figure are targeted. The text must be legible, properly aligned, and integrated into the base surface without disrupting the overall design or appearing superimposed unnaturally. The evaluation checks whether the typography is crisp, proportionally correct, and matches the luxurious aesthetic intended by the edit.",
      "question": "Is the text \"Savanna Essence\" clearly visible, correctly positioned on the base, and rendered with sharp edges and consistent font style without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the cheetahs into perfume bottles while preserving their pose, the structural integrity of the figures must remain intact. This includes accurate limb positioning, tail curvature, head orientation, and overall silhouette. The conversion to bottle form should not alter these anatomical features beyond recognition or cause disproportionate scaling. The evaluation checks whether the golden forms retain the original animal’s natural proportions and posture, ensuring visual credibility.",
      "question": "Do the transformed cheetah figures maintain their original sitting posture and anatomical proportions, with no visible elongation, compression, or deformation of limbs or torso?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of creating a high-end retail display, the composition between the two golden figures and the central glass façade must appear balanced and cohesive. The spatial relationship between the objects—especially the alignment of the bases, symmetry of the figures, and integration of the glass element—must support a sense of elegance and realism. Any mismatch in height, angle, or shadow could break visual coherence.",
      "question": "Are the two golden cheetah-bottle figures symmetrically aligned with the central glass façade, and do they cast consistent shadows that match the lighting direction and surface reflection?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
