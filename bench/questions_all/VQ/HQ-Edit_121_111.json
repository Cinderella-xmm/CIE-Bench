      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying a watercolor aesthetic across the entire image, this question evaluates whether the overall rendering style maintains visual coherence and avoids artifacts such as uneven brushstrokes, color bleeding, or loss of fine details in critical areas like the squirrel’s fur and facial features. The transformation must preserve structural integrity while shifting from photorealism to a stylized look.",
      "question": "Are the brushstroke effects and color transitions throughout the image smooth and consistent, without visible jagged edges or unnatural smudging in the fur, grass, or sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding light pink and pale yellow to the squirrel’s fur, this question checks whether the new colors are integrated into the fur texture without creating sharp boundaries, unnatural shine, or clumping that breaks the natural flow of the fur. The colors should enhance the magical theme without distorting the animal’s appearance.",
      "question": "Do the light pink and pale yellow accents on the squirrel’s fur blend seamlessly with the surrounding gray and orange fur, maintaining natural texture and avoiding isolated patches or overly bright spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding tiny wings to the squirrel, this question evaluates whether the wings are proportionally correct, anatomically plausible, and rendered with consistent material and lighting. The wings must not intersect with the squirrel’s body awkwardly or appear as a floating, disconnected element.",
      "question": "Are the wings attached to the squirrel’s back in a position that follows natural shoulder anatomy, with appropriate size and curvature, and do they show consistent shading and transparency matching the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing acorns with sparkling jewels, this question examines whether the new objects retain realistic proportions, surface properties (such as facets and reflections), and proper shadowing relative to their surroundings. The jewels must not appear flat or unnaturally glowing.",
      "question": "Do the jewels replacing the acorns have defined facets and reflective surfaces that respond realistically to light, casting appropriate shadows on the grass, and are they sized consistently with the squirrel’s hand and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of blurring the grassy backdrop into a fairytale forest, this question assesses whether the blur effect creates a smooth depth transition without introducing artifacts like ghosting, double edges, or unnatural color shifts. The blurred background must still suggest a forest environment without losing coherence.",
      "question": "Is the blurred background a gradual transition from the foreground grass to a soft-focus forest, with no abrupt edges or repeated patterns that suggest artificial blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of embedding text in the sky, this question checks whether the text is positioned and styled to integrate naturally with the sky, avoiding sharp contrasts, pixelation, or interference with cloud formations. The text should appear as part of the scene rather than a separate layer.",
      "question": "Is the text \"The Jewel Gatherer of Whispering Woods\" placed in the sky such that it appears softly integrated with the clouds, with no harsh outlines or unnatural glow, and is it legible without disrupting the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
