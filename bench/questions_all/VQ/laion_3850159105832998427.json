      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the tuning pegs with golden horn-like spikes on the headstock, evaluate whether the new elements are physically plausible and integrate naturally with the neckâ€™s curvature. The horns must emerge from the same plane as the original pegs and maintain proportional alignment with the fretboard.",
      "question": "Do the golden horn-like spikes on the headstock align symmetrically with the neck and show no signs of clipping, distortion, or mismatched angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding luminescent runes on the fretboard, assess whether the runes are embedded realistically into the wood surface without disrupting the natural grain or creating artificial glows. The glow should be localized and consistent across all runes.",
      "question": "Are the luminescent runes clearly visible along the fretboard without bleeding into the wood or appearing as separate floating overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the strings into fiery tendrils, check whether the tendrils follow the original string path from bridge to nut and remain connected at both ends. Each tendril should have a consistent width and flame-like structure without breaking mid-path.",
      "question": "Do the fiery tendrils originate from the bridge and terminate at the nut, following a continuous and uninterrupted path without gaps or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the cutaway horns into wings with scale-like patterns, evaluate whether the wings extend outward symmetrically from the body and display uniform, repeating scale textures. The wings should not overlap or fold unnaturally.",
      "question": "Are the wing structures symmetrical on both sides of the body and covered in evenly spaced, realistic scale patterns without gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reinterpreting the guitar body as a dragon's torso, assess whether the transformation preserves the original body shape while introducing organic textures. The surface should transition smoothly from wood to dragon skin without abrupt changes or missing details.",
      "question": "Does the body maintain the original guitar's silhouette while showing consistent dragon-like textures such as scales or ridges, with no visible seams or loss of contour detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
