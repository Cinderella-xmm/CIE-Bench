      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the sparrow into an ethereal blossom spirit with petal-like feathers and a soft pink gradient, evaluate whether the feather texture and color transition at the bird's body (especially head, chest, and wing areas) appear natural and consistent with the surrounding floral elements. The original image shows detailed feather patterns and realistic textures; thus, any artificial or unnatural gradient application could disrupt authenticity.",
      "question": "Do the petal-like feathers on the sparrow’s body exhibit smooth transitions in pink gradient without visible pixelation, banding, or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding blossom patterns along the wings, assess whether the floral motifs integrated into the wing structure maintain geometric coherence and material consistency with the rest of the bird’s form. The original wing feathers have clear striations and layered structure—any superimposed pattern must not distort this anatomy.",
      "question": "Are the blossom patterns on the wings aligned with the natural feather structure and do they avoid overlapping or warping of existing feather edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the tail with cascading cherry blossoms, determine if the new tail maintains structural plausibility and visual continuity with the bird’s body. The original tail has defined feather layers and tapering shape—replacing it with flowers must preserve anatomical logic and avoid floating or disconnected elements.",
      "question": "Does the cascading cherry blossom tail emerge naturally from the base of the original tail and follow a downward flow that matches the bird’s posture without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of embedding delicate vines around the legs, evaluate whether the vine placement adheres to physical realism—specifically, whether they wrap around the leg joints and feet in a way that respects limb proportions and does not intersect unnaturally with claws or skin.",
      "question": "Do the vines around the sparrow’s legs follow natural curvature and thickness proportional to the leg size, without penetrating or distorting the foot structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding sparkling dewdrop ornaments to the chest, assess whether these elements are rendered with appropriate transparency, reflection, and scale relative to the bird’s body. Dewdrops should appear as small, spherical highlights without excessive glare or unnatural positioning.",
      "question": "Are the dewdrop ornaments on the chest positioned realistically on the surface of the feathers and do they reflect light consistently with surrounding lighting conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
