Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the Eiffel Tower’s metal lattice into enchanted vines with glowing floral motifs, this involves replacing the structural material and texture of the tower. The original image shows a clearly defined iron lattice structure with consistent geometric patterns. The editing must preserve the overall shape and proportions while changing the material appearance. The question evaluates whether the new vine-like texture appears natural in form and integration with the existing structure, avoiding unnatural textures or broken geometry.
Question: Are the enchanted vines covering the Eiffel Tower's lattice continuous and aligned with its original structural lines, without jagged edges or inconsistent thickness?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding glowing floral motifs to the tower, these elements must be integrated into the structure without disrupting the visual coherence. The original image has no such decorative elements, so their addition must not introduce floating or misaligned features. The glow should be consistent with light direction and source (e.g., sunset), maintaining plausibility in lighting interaction.
Question: Do the glowing floral motifs emit light uniformly and cast soft glows that match the ambient lighting from the sunset, without abrupt brightness spikes or disconnected highlights?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the base of the Eiffel Tower with an ancient stone platform bearing arcane symbols, this involves altering the foundation and ground-level structure. The original image shows a smooth, symmetrical base with a clear transition to the surrounding ground. The new platform must maintain structural symmetry and scale consistency with the tower. The symbols must appear carved and integrated, not pasted or distorted.
Question: Is the ancient stone platform at the base of the tower proportionally scaled to the tower's legs and positioned symmetrically, without visible warping or misalignment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding arcane symbols to the stone platform, these markings must be coherent in style and depth, resembling engraved carvings. They should not appear as flat overlays or pixelated textures. Their placement must follow logical design patterns and avoid clashing with the architectural lines of the platform.
Question: Are the arcane symbols on the stone platform evenly spaced, properly oriented, and rendered with depth and shadowing that suggest they are carved into the stone?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of imbuing the sunset backdrop with swirling nebulae reflecting the tower’s radiant aura, this involves modifying the sky’s content beyond a natural sunset. The original image features a solid gradient sunset with a large sun behind the tower. The added nebulae must blend seamlessly with the existing sky gradient and not create abrupt color transitions or unnatural cloud formations. Their swirls should align with the direction of the light and not obscure the sun unnaturally.
Question: Do the swirling nebulae in the sky flow smoothly from the tower’s base upward, blending with the orange gradient without sharp edges or disconnected patches?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of culminating the tower in a crystal pinnacle, this involves replacing the original spire tip with a transparent or refractive crystal structure. The original spire is pointed and metallic. The new crystal must maintain vertical alignment and optical consistency—its facets should reflect the surrounding light realistically and not appear flat or misshapen.
Question: Does the crystal pinnacle at the top of the tower have distinct, reflective facets that catch the sunlight and show subtle refractions, without appearing blurry or geometrically distorted?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
