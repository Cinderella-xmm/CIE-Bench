      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the front clock face with a monocled eye, this involves modifying the circular face area where the Roman numerals and hands were located. The new element must integrate with the existing frame and glass panel without distorting the surrounding structure. The eye should have a realistic lens shape and monocle rim, consistent with the metallic theme. The question evaluates whether the replacement preserves the natural appearance of the surface and avoids mismatched textures or edges.",
      "question": "Is the monocled eye on the front face of the clock seamlessly integrated into the original frame, with no visible seam or texture discontinuity around its perimeter?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of extending ornate gears as limb-like appendages from the sides of the clock, these additions must emerge logically from the vertical columns or side panels. They should maintain consistent material appearance (brass/copper) and scale relative to the clock’s height. The question checks whether the gear limbs are structurally coherent, not floating or detached, and whether their joint points show natural integration with the original structure.",
      "question": "Do the gear-like limbs extend from the side panels of the clock with continuous material flow and geometric alignment, showing no signs of floating or disconnected joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the pendulum into a swinging tail, the original spherical bob and chain must be transformed into a flexible, articulated tail. The tail should originate from the lower center of the clock and hang below the base, maintaining mechanical continuity. The question evaluates whether the tail’s shape and attachment point are physically plausible and whether it appears to swing naturally without breaking the clock's silhouette.",
      "question": "Is the pendulum converted into a tail that extends downward from the bottom center of the clock, maintaining a smooth curvature and consistent material texture with the rest of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying brass and copper hues to the clock’s metallic skin, the entire surface must shift to warm metallic tones while preserving the original shading and highlights. The color change should respect light direction and depth, avoiding flat or inconsistent coloring. The question checks whether the new colors appear natural under the existing lighting and do not introduce unnatural gradients or patches.",
      "question": "Are the brass and copper tones applied uniformly across the clock’s surface, matching the lighting direction and showing realistic reflections and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding steam valves at the corners of the clock, these components must project outward from the edges without disrupting the corner geometry. They should be sized proportionally and aligned with the structural lines. The question evaluates whether the valves are correctly positioned and integrated, without overlapping or distorting adjacent surfaces.",
      "question": "Are the steam valves placed at each corner of the clock’s upper section, protruding outward with clean edges and no overlap or deformation of the surrounding structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of engraving intricate patterns along the structure, these details must follow the existing decorative motifs and align with the relief work on the base and columns. The engravings should not appear blurry, pixelated, or misplaced. The question checks whether the added patterns are sharp, consistent with the original style, and properly scaled.",
      "question": "Are the engraved patterns along the clock’s base and sides clear, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the original ornamental design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
