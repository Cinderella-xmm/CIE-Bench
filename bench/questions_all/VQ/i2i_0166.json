      "thinking_process": "Considering the poem placement, it’s crucial to ensure that it doesn’t interfere with the original structural coherence of the image. For instance, checking if the text overlaps or obscures parts of the branch or bird would help maintain the image's visual plausibility.",
      "question": "Does the poem text appear in a position that does not obscure important elements like the bird or branch, ensuring structural consistency?",

      "thinking_process": "Adding text to an image can sometimes introduce unnatural textures, especially if the text doesn't properly integrate with the lighting and shadows present in the image. Ensuring the poem's text has a smooth texture helps maintain the image's overall authenticity.",
      "question": "Does the added poem text exhibit a smooth texture that aligns with the lighting and shadow of the original image, avoiding unnatural artifacts?",
