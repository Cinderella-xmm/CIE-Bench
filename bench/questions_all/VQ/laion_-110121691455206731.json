      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding facial features (eyes, mouth) onto the watch dial, evaluate whether the placement of these features respects the original layout of the dial, including numerals and subdials. The facial elements must not overlap or obscure critical components like the hour markers or date window, and their style must integrate naturally with the metallic surface without causing texture mismatches.",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) positioned on the dial such that they do not obscure the numerals or subdials, and do they blend with the metallic texture without introducing unnatural shading or edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of inserting a detective desk and magnifying glass, assess whether these objects are proportionally scaled and physically plausible in relation to the watch. The desk should not appear oversized or clipped, and the magnifying glass should have a realistic shape and handle without distortion.",
      "question": "Is the detective desk and magnifying glass proportionally sized relative to the watch, and are they rendered with consistent line weight and shading that matches the comic style without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the background to include a cluttered office setting, evaluate whether the new elements (e.g., papers, files) are layered appropriately with depth and perspective, and do not intersect incorrectly with the watch or create floating or disconnected objects.",
      "question": "Do the background elements (cluttered office items) appear spatially coherent with the watch, showing correct layering and perspective without overlapping or clipping through the watch's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating tick mark sound effects around the dial, assess whether these graphical elements are evenly spaced, clearly defined, and free from pixelation or blurring that could indicate low-resolution rendering or artifacting.",
      "question": "Are the tick mark sound effects uniformly shaped and cleanly rendered around the dial, without jagged edges, smudging, or inconsistent spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying cartoonish expressions while preserving metallic and leather textures, evaluate whether the stylization maintains the original material properties—such as the reflective quality of the silver casing and the stitched texture of the leather strap—without introducing artificial patterns or color shifts.",
      "question": "Does the stylized version retain the original texture of the black leather strap and the brushed silver finish of the case, with no visible texture warping or color inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of retaining the watch’s core structure during anthropomorphism, assess whether key functional parts (hour/minute hands, subdials, date window) remain intact and correctly positioned, ensuring the watch is still recognizable despite added features.",
      "question": "Are the hour and minute hands, subdials, and date window preserved in their original positions and proportions, without being obscured or deformed by the added facial features or other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
