      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the necklace into a floating chandelier suspended by ornate branches, this question evaluates whether the structural integrity and fine details of the original necklace are preserved after reconfiguration. The editing position is the central necklace area, which includes the ornate metalwork, gemstones, and pendant. The transformation must maintain the original design’s complexity and avoid stretching, warping, or losing engraved patterns.",
      "question": "Are the metal filigree patterns and gemstone placements on the transformed necklace clearly defined and free from geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of repositioning the snake tail to emerge from a mossy bank, this question assesses whether the tail’s texture, curvature, and connection to the moss are natural and continuous. The editing position is the green snake tail on the left side of the neck, now extending into a new environment. The transition between the tail and moss must show consistent scale, lighting, and surface detail.",
      "question": "Does the snake tail maintain its original scaly texture and smooth curvature as it emerges from the mossy bank without sudden breaks or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of introducing a glass dome over the scene, this question checks for realistic optical effects such as transparency, reflections, and refraction. The editing position is the surrounding space enclosing the entire diorama. The dome must appear as a cohesive, transparent boundary without visible seams, ghosting, or inconsistent light behavior.",
      "question": "Is the glass dome visually transparent with consistent reflections and refractions across its surface, showing no jagged edges or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a glistening emerald pond encircled by silver leaves, this question evaluates the realism of water surface properties and metallic leaf textures. The editing position is the lower portion of the scene where the pond and leaves are located. The water should reflect surrounding elements appropriately, and the leaves should have realistic metallic sheen and form.",
      "question": "Does the emerald pond display natural water surface details such as subtle ripples and reflections, and are the silver leaves evenly shaped with consistent metallic highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of suspending the chandelier via ornate branches, this question assesses whether the branches follow natural growth patterns and connect logically to the chandelier. The editing position is the upper region above the necklace, where the branches originate. The branches must not appear stretched, broken, or improperly scaled relative to the chandelier.",
      "question": "Are the ornate branches supporting the chandelier proportionally sized and shaped to resemble natural plant structures without angular breaks or unnatural joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring spatial alignment between all elements, this question checks whether the newly added components (pond, leaves, dome, branches) are correctly positioned relative to the original necklace and snake tail. The editing position spans the entire scene, focusing on depth layering and occlusion relationships.",
      "question": "Do the new elements (pond, leaves, branches, dome) properly overlap and interact with the original necklace and snake tail without floating disjointedly or violating depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
