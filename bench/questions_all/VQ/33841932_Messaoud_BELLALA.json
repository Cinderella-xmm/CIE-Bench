The original building has a smooth, tapering curve; any flattening should preserve this curvature without breaking it into unnatural segments or distorting its height-to-width ratio.",
      "question": "Does the bookmark version of the central golden curved skyscraper maintain a smooth, continuous curve without broken or jagged edges?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the angular black skyscraper into a cartoon-style metal bookmark, this checks whether the sharp angles and silhouette are preserved without geometric deformation. The original building has a distinctive asymmetrical top and vertical alignment; any stylization must retain these features without altering their relative positions or creating floating corners.",
      "question": "Are the sharp angles and vertical lines of the angular black skyscraper bookmark clearly defined and geometrically consistent without distortion?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of stylizing the stepped golden building into a bookmark, this evaluates whether the tiered structure is accurately represented in 2D. The original building has multiple horizontal steps; the bookmark version must maintain these levels without merging or collapsing them into a single block.",
      "question": "Do the horizontal steps of the stepped golden building bookmark remain distinct and evenly spaced without merging or overlapping?",

The original building has a grid-like facade; the stylized version must preserve this regularity without stretching or fragmenting the windows.",
      "question": "Are the vertical lines and window patterns on the rectangular high-rise bookmark aligned and evenly spaced without warping or missing sections?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying shimmering gold and silver hues to the bookmarks, this evaluates whether the glazing effect appears uniform and realistic for metal surfaces. The lighting should reflect off the surface in a way that matches the direction of light source, avoiding random speckles or inconsistent highlights.",
      "question": "Do the gold and silver glazes on the bookmarks show consistent reflective highlights without scattered noise or unnatural glittering?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the bookmarks onto an open book with doodles, this evaluates whether the bookâ€™s perspective and shadowing are physically plausible. The book should appear flat with proper depth cues, and the bookmarks should be clipped in a way that suggests real-world mechanics (e.g., clip placement, shadow under the page).",
      "question": "Are the bookmarks positioned on the book with correct perspective and shadows that suggest they are resting on a flat surface without floating or overlapping unrealistically?",

Stars and waves should be simple, hand-drawn style, and placed in logical locations (e.g., near the edges of the page).",
      "question": "Are the stars and wave doodles drawn in a consistent cartoon style and placed within the margins of the book without overlapping the bookmarks or appearing misaligned?",

Any edge should be sharp and clean, especially where colors meet or where shadows fall.",
