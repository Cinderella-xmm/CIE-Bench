The goal is to assess perceptual authenticity in material representation.",
      "question": "Does the surface of the painted figure show consistent brushstroke patterns and subtle texture variations typical of oil paint on wood, without blocky or repetitive digital artifacts?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the beard and mustache to flow like water, this question evaluates whether the elongated hair maintains a plausible form for hair, even when exaggerated. It checks for continuity of strands, absence of liquid-like blobs, and adherence to hair physics.",
      "question": "Do the strands of the elongated beard and mustache maintain continuous, fiber-like structure without forming unnatural loops, droplets, or fluid-like surfaces?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a velvet cloak with golden embroidery, this question examines whether the texture of the fabric appears soft and rich, with proper light interaction, and whether the embroidery follows logical patterns and scale relative to the garment.",
      "question": "Is the velvet texture of the cloak smooth and reflective with depth, and are the golden embroidery lines evenly spaced and aligned with the fabric folds?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the cap with a wide-brimmed hat and peacock feathers, this question checks whether the new hat fits the head shape naturally and whether the feathers are attached at a plausible angle and position without overlapping the face or appearing detached.",
      "question": "Is the wide-brimmed hat positioned correctly on the head without distorting the skull shape, and are the peacock feathers attached along the brim with natural curvature and no clipping into the face?",

      "question": "Are the edges of the figure cleanly separated from the background without haloing, double outlines, or partial transparency that suggests poor compositing?",
