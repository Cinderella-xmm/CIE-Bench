Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the wooden surface with an elegant marble texture, evaluate whether the new material (marble) is visually consistent with the rest of the scene in terms of lighting, reflectivity, and texture. The original wooden surface has a warm tone and visible grain patterns; the replacement must maintain physical plausibility and avoid unnatural transitions or artifacts at the boundary between the teapot base and the surface.
Question: Does the marble texture beneath the teapot exhibit natural veining and color variation without abrupt edges or artificial patterns?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of overlaying a transparent label on the pot detailing flavors such as "Earl Grey Elegance," assess whether the label appears integrated into the teapot's surface without distorting its metallic sheen or reflection. The label should not introduce halos, misaligned text, or inconsistent transparency that breaks visual coherence.
Question: Is the transparent label positioned on the teapot’s body with uniform opacity and no visible pixelation or ghosting around the text edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a finely embossed gold monogram logo on the lid, evaluate whether the logo conforms to the existing decorative style of the teapot—specifically, the engraved floral and scrollwork motifs. The addition must preserve the depth and lighting consistency of the surrounding engravings, avoiding floating or unnaturally bright elements.
Question: Does the gold monogram on the lid align with the surrounding engravings in terms of depth, shadow, and metallic finish, without appearing raised or detached?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of creating a box with similar engravings to enhance brand appeal, assess whether the box maintains structural proportionality and material consistency with the teapot. The box should be placed logically near the teapot, matching its ornate design, and not appear warped or disproportionately sized.
Question: Is the box positioned adjacent to the teapot with correct perspective and scale, and does it feature consistent engraving patterns and material appearance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining overall realism and natural appearance after all edits, evaluate whether the entire composition—including the teapot, label, monogram, box, and surface—preserves consistent lighting, shadows, and reflections. Any mismatch in these aspects could indicate artifacts or poor integration.
Question: Are the shadows cast by the teapot and box consistent with the light source direction and do they match the ambient lighting of the scene?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
