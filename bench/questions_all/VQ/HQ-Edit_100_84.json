      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding intricate Middle Eastern ornamentation to the dhow’s hull and deck, evaluate whether the added patterns maintain consistent material appearance (wood) and do not distort the boat's structure or geometry. The ornamentation should follow the curvature of the hull and not introduce floating or misaligned elements.",
      "question": "Are the added decorative patterns on the dhow’s hull and deck aligned with the wood grain and structural lines, and do they lack jagged edges or unnatural textures?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding mythical sea creatures with delicate detailing, assess whether the creatures are integrated into the water surface with proper lighting and reflection, and whether their shapes are anatomically plausible and free from distortion.",
      "question": "Do the mythical sea creatures near the dhow have smooth contours, realistic scales or skin textures, and proper interaction with the water surface (e.g., ripples, reflections)?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying rich blues and golds for contrast, evaluate whether the color application preserves natural gradients and avoids over-saturation or unnatural color shifts in the boat, sails, and water.",
      "question": "Are the blue and gold tones applied consistently across the scene without causing color bleeding, pixelation, or loss of detail in shaded areas of the boat and water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of simplifying distant sailboats into silhouettes, assess whether the reduced detail still allows recognition of the boats' basic forms and whether they retain separation from the background.",
      "question": "Are the distant sailboats rendered as dark, simplified shapes that maintain their boat-like outline and do not merge into the sky or water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding an Arabian skyline mirage with geometric patterns at the horizon, evaluate whether the mirage appears as a translucent, wavy overlay that mimics heat distortion and does not appear as a flat or abruptly placed structure.",
      "question": "Is the Arabian skyline mirage at the horizon rendered with a soft, shimmering effect that blends with the sky and water, and does it display geometric patterns without sharp edges or solid blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
