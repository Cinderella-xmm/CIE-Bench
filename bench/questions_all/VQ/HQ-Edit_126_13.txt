Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding annotated lines with minimalist icons to represent each step in “The Journey of Tea” around the tea set, evaluate whether the newly added diagram elements (lines, icons) maintain structural coherence with the existing objects such as the teapot, cup, and vase. Specifically, check if the lines flow naturally around the tea set without intersecting or distorting any object’s shape, and whether their placement respects the spatial logic of the scene.
Question: Do the annotated lines representing the tea journey follow a smooth, non-intersecting path around the tea set without overlapping or deforming the original objects?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of integrating handwritten calligraphy with soft pastel green hues, assess whether the text is positioned in a way that does not disrupt the visual harmony of the beige and cherry blossom setting. Evaluate if the color of the calligraphy blends naturally with the background and if the handwriting style appears authentic and legible without pixelation or unnatural texture.
Question: Is the handwritten calligraphy in soft pastel green seamlessly integrated into the scene without causing visual contrast or texture artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding minimalist icons for each step (harvesting, boiling, sipping, blossoms), examine whether these icons are proportionally consistent with the surrounding elements and placed in logical positions relative to the tea set. Check if they appear flat or distorted, and if their design matches the minimalistic aesthetic of the scene.
Question: Are the minimalist icons for each step of the tea journey proportionally scaled and visually coherent with the surrounding objects and layout?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of symbolizing tranquility with blossoms, evaluate whether the added floral elements (blossoms or petals) appear to float naturally in the air or rest on surfaces without clipping, unnatural shadows, or floating disconnected from physical logic. Check if petal positions suggest natural motion or drift.
Question: Do the added cherry blossom petals appear to float or fall naturally in the air without unnatural positioning or missing shadows?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the original table setting while adding new elements, assess whether the addition of diagrams and annotations affects the integrity of the existing materials—such as the woven texture of the table mat, the matte finish of the teapot, and the ceramic surface of the cup. Ensure no material degradation or texture mismatch occurs due to editing.
Question: Are the textures of the table mat, teapot, cup, and vase preserved without visible distortion, blurring, or artificial seams where new elements were added?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
