Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of transforming the location from a sports team's locker room to an elegant mid-century modern showroom, we need to assess if the new environment maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility while avoiding unnatural textures or artifacts. The background lockers and their colors should be replaced with elements fitting a showroom setting.
Question: Are the lockers in the background seamlessly replaced with mid-century modern showroom elements without visible artifacts or unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement involves substituting the jersey display with a luxurious piece of designer furniture. We need to ensure that the furniture fits naturally into the scene, maintaining the proportions and physical rationality of the elements within the image.
Question: Does the luxurious piece of designer furniture appear proportionally correct and physically plausible in place of the jersey display?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: To maintain the overall authenticity and natural appearance, the characters' interactions and gestures should remain consistent with the new setting. The man in the suit appears to be gesturing towards the jersey; this gesture should logically correspond to the new furniture.
Question: Do the characters' gestures and body language remain natural and consistent with the new showroom setting and the luxurious furniture?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The lighting and shadows in the original image contribute to its realism. After editing, these elements should still align with the new showroom environment, ensuring there are no inconsistencies or unnatural lighting effects.
Question: Is the lighting and shadow in the showroom consistent with the new setting, without introducing any unnatural or inconsistent effects?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement emphasizes retaining the core elements while ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility. The characters and their clothing should remain unchanged apart from the background and the jersey display.
Question: Have the characters and their clothing remained visually consistent and unchanged, aside from the background and the jersey display being replaced?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
