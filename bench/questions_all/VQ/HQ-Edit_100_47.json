      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the lawn with a mirror-like surface, evaluate whether the material change at the central reflecting pool area (originally green grass) maintains visual credibility. The mirror should reflect surrounding elements (trees, sky, tower) accurately and without unnatural distortions or texture mismatches.",
      "question": "Does the mirror-like surface in the foreground reflect the sky, trees, and Eiffel Tower with clear, undistorted imagery and smooth texture?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of layering the skyline and foreground as paper cut-outs, assess whether the depth planes (skyline buildings, trees, pathways) exhibit consistent scaling and alignment, avoiding overlapping errors or geometric distortions that would break spatial logic.",
      "question": "Are the distant buildings and tree clusters positioned at distinct depth layers without overlapping or misaligned edges that suggest incorrect layering?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding tiny 3D-printed pedestrians, check whether the small human figures on the pathways and near the mirror surface are proportionally correct, anatomically plausible, and lack unnatural shapes or textures such as jagged edges or missing limbs.",
      "question": "Do the small pedestrian figures on the pathways have consistent proportions, recognizable body parts, and smooth textures without visible deformities or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of encasing the scene in a dark-framed shadow box with metallic edges, verify that the frame appears as a solid, continuous border around the image, with no gaps, floating edges, or inconsistent shading that would suggest poor integration.",
      "question": "Is the dark frame with metallic edges present around the entire perimeter of the image, appearing solid and uniformly integrated without breaks or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question": "Are the engraved city names and coordinates along the frame legible, precisely aligned, and free from pixelation or uneven spacing?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
