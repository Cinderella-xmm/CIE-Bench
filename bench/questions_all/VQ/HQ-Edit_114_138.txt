Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of emphasizing the silk robe with gold highlights and floral patterns, evaluate whether the texture and material of the robe in the edited image maintain a natural appearance consistent with real silk fabric. The original image shows a detailed floral pattern on a satin-like surface; any enhancement must preserve realistic light reflection, thread consistency, and pattern continuity without introducing artificial sheen or unnatural color gradients.
Question: Does the silk robe exhibit natural fabric texture with consistent gold highlights and floral patterns that follow realistic light interaction and material properties?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of turning the book into a layered story scene, assess whether the book’s structure remains geometrically plausible and visually coherent. The original image features a solid, bound book with defined spine and cover; transforming it into a layered scene must not distort its physical form or introduce floating elements that violate structural integrity or perspective logic.
Question: Is the book’s shape preserved with realistic page layers and depth, avoiding broken edges, inconsistent thickness, or floating components that disrupt its structural coherence?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding ornate bookshelf designs, evaluate whether the background bookshelves retain their original architectural proportions and material consistency. The original image shows uniformly aligned books on wooden shelves; any added decorative elements must integrate seamlessly without distorting shelf geometry or introducing mismatched textures or lighting anomalies.
Question: Are the bookshelf designs integrated without altering the original shelf alignment, spacing, or wood grain texture, maintaining visual credibility and structural rationality?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of including detachable bookmark panels with vintage tea motifs, assess whether these new elements appear physically plausible and properly attached to the book. The original image includes a visible book held by both hands; any added bookmarks must be positioned naturally within the book’s pages without intersecting fingers improperly or appearing disconnected from the page structure.
Question: Do the bookmark panels appear correctly inserted between the book’s pages, with proper scale, orientation, and connection to the book, avoiding floating or misaligned placement?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the woman into a semi-cartoon style while preserving core features, evaluate whether her facial structure, especially around the eyes, nose, and mouth, maintains anatomical accuracy despite stylization. The original image shows a clearly defined elderly face with round glasses; any cartoon-like modification must not distort facial proportions or create unnatural contours such as elongated features or inconsistent shading.
Question: Are the facial features, particularly around the eyes and mouth, proportionally accurate and free from exaggerated or distorted shapes that compromise visual plausibility?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
