      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding iridescent, woven wings resembling a stained-glass mosaic to the spider\", evaluate whether the wings are visually coherent with the spider's body structure and whether they exhibit natural textures and color gradients typical of such materials. The position is the upper back region of the spider, where wings would logically extend from the thorax. This transformation involves introducing a new element that must maintain structural consistency with the original anatomy while avoiding unnatural patterns or broken geometric shapes.",
      "question": "Are the iridescent wings attached to the spider’s thorax symmetrically and do they display smooth, continuous mosaic-like patterns without jagged edges or texture breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"replacing the abdomen with a luminous orb generating gentle, moving patterns\", assess whether the replacement maintains anatomical plausibility and visual coherence with the rest of the spider’s body. The original abdomen is located at the rear of the spider and is distinct in shape and pattern. The new luminous orb must integrate seamlessly, preserving scale and spatial relationship with legs and head.",
      "question": "Is the luminous orb positioned where the original abdomen was, and does it maintain proportional size and alignment with the spider’s body without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adorn[ing] its legs with golden filigree spirals\", examine whether the added decorative elements follow the natural curvature and joint structure of the spider’s legs. The legs extend from the cephalothorax and have segmented joints; any added filigree must conform to these segments without distorting their shape or creating unnatural gaps or overlaps.",
      "question": "Do the golden filigree spirals wrap around each leg segment smoothly, following the natural bends and joints without breaking or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"modifying its fangs to resemble delicate crystal needles\", evaluate whether the fangs—located at the front of the spider’s head—are transformed into slender, transparent, needle-like structures that retain structural integrity and proportion relative to the head. The change should not distort the mouthparts or create unnatural transparency inconsistencies.",
      "question": "Are the fangs now thin, translucent, and needle-shaped, extending naturally from the spider’s mouth area without appearing misshapen or disconnected?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding a wispy, ethereal aura emanating from its shimmering body\", determine whether the aura appears as a soft, diffuse glow surrounding the spider without disrupting the web or foliage in the background. The aura should be consistent in density and directionality, not casting harsh shadows or introducing pixelation or noise artifacts.",
      "question": "Does the ethereal aura surround the spider uniformly, fading gently into the background without visible streaks, sharp edges, or interference with nearby leaves or web strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
