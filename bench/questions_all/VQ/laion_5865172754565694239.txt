Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires adding a cheeky, expressive face near the handlebars on the Ducati bike frame. This involves modifying the red frame area around the head tube region (near the stem and top tube junction), which is a structural component of the bicycle. The addition of facial features such as eyes, eyebrows, and a mouth must be integrated into the frame without distorting its geometry or material appearance. The face should appear as if it's part of the frame’s surface, not floating or misaligned. This operation may affect the realism if proportions are off or textures don’t match the original metallic paint finish.
-Sub requirement 1: Adding a cartoon face to the frame near the handlebars—evaluate whether the facial features are proportionally correct, seamlessly blended with the frame’s surface, and free from unnatural texture or color mismatches.

-<Thinking Process 2>: The instruction specifies adding cartoon-style limbs emerging from the hubs of both wheels. The hub areas (center of front and rear wheels) are mechanical components with defined shapes and materials (metallic, circular). Limbs must emerge naturally from these points without breaking geometric continuity or appearing disconnected. The limbs should maintain consistent style with the rest of the animation but not interfere with the wheel structure or spokes.
-Sub requirement 2: Adding limbs from the hubs—assess whether the limbs are attached at realistic anchor points, maintain proper perspective relative to the wheel, and do not distort the hub or spokes.

-<Thinking Process 3>: Dynamic motion lines are to be added to emphasize speed. These lines typically originate from moving parts like wheels or frame and extend outward in a directional flow. They must not intersect critical components awkwardly or obscure important details like the chain, derailleur, or brakes. Their placement and angle should suggest forward motion while preserving visual clarity.
-Sub requirement 3: Adding motion lines—check whether the lines follow logical directionality, avoid overlapping key functional parts, and are stylistically consistent with comic art without disrupting the bike’s structure.

-<Thinking Process 4>: The red frame is to be transformed into a "hero suit" appearance. This implies stylized coloring, possibly with gradients, patterns, or outlines that resemble superhero costumes. However, this must not alter the actual shape or material properties of the frame. The transformation should enhance rather than degrade the perception of the frame as a real object.
-Sub requirement 4: Converting the frame into a hero suit—evaluate whether the new design maintains the original frame’s silhouette and structural integrity, avoids unrealistic warping, and uses textures/colors that remain plausible within an animated context.

-<Thinking Process 5>: Comic-style sound effects such as “Vroom!” and “Zoom!” are to be overlaid. These text elements should be positioned dynamically (e.g., trailing behind the bike or near the wheels) but not obstruct vital components like the brand name (“DUCATI”) or gear system. Font style and size must match typical comic book conventions while remaining legible and non-intrusive.
-Sub requirement 5: Overlaying sound effects—determine whether the text is placed in a way that respects spatial logic (e.g., following motion direction), does not block key visual elements, and integrates smoothly into the scene without pixelation or clipping.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a cartoon face near the handlebars on the frame, evaluate whether the facial features (eyes, mouth, etc.) are properly aligned with the frame’s geometry, have consistent texture and shading matching the red paint, and do not introduce jagged edges or color bleeding.
Question: Are the facial features on the frame near the handlebars seamlessly integrated with the red surface, showing no visible seams, texture mismatch, or color artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding limbs from the hubs, assess whether the limbs emerge from the center of each wheel without deforming the hub, bending spokes, or violating the circular symmetry of the wheel structure.
Question: Do the cartoon limbs extend from the hub centers without distorting the wheel rims, spokes, or hub components?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding motion lines, check whether the lines originate from appropriate positions (e.g., rear wheel or frame) and extend in a direction consistent with forward motion, avoiding obstruction of the drivetrain or branding.
Question: Are the motion lines positioned along the sides of the bike and angled forward, without crossing over the chain, derailleur, or “DUCATI” logo?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the frame into a hero suit, evaluate whether the red frame retains its original shape and thickness, and any added patterns or outlines do not create false depth or break the continuity of the frame tubes.
Question: Does the frame retain its original tubular structure and dimensional consistency despite the added hero suit design, with no bulges, collapses, or incorrect curvature?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of overlaying sound effects, verify that the text elements like “Vroom!” and “Zoom!” are clearly readable, placed in motion-aligned locations (e.g., trailing behind the bike), and do not overlap critical components such as the seat post or handlebars.
Question: Are the sound effect texts positioned outside the main structural components of the bike and oriented in a way that suggests movement, without obscuring the “DUCATI” branding or control levers?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
