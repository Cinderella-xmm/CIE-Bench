Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the black attire into deep velvet, evaluate whether the material texture and color of the dress in the edited image reflect a natural appearance consistent with velvet fabric. The original image shows a beaded, sheer black garment with structured embellishments; the conversion to velvet must preserve structural coherence and avoid unnatural textures such as pixelation or synthetic-looking surfaces.
Question: Does the dress material appear as a smooth, richly textured deep velvet without visible artifacts like unnatural sheen or inconsistent surface patterns?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the jewelry with pearl adornments, assess whether the earrings and headpiece have been transformed into realistic pearls while maintaining their shape and placement. The original earrings are dark gemstone chandeliers; converting them to pearls requires attention to reflective properties, spherical form, and natural luster without distorting the original design structure.
Question: Are the earrings and any headpiece elements composed of spherical, uniformly shaped pearls with natural light reflections and no distorted geometry?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of modifying the hairstyle into an elaborate Renaissance-style coiffure, evaluate whether the hair has been restructured into a historically plausible updo with intricate braiding or ornamentation. The original image features a sleek, netted hairstyle; the transformation must maintain anatomical plausibility and avoid floating strands or unnatural volume.
Question: Is the hairstyle rendered as a voluminous, intricately styled updo with coherent strands and no floating or broken hair sections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of changing the background to a classic interior with heavy tapestries using warm earth tones, assess whether the new background is visually coherent with the subject and avoids abrupt transitions or artificial textures. The original background is softly blurred with event lighting; the new setting must integrate seamlessly without visible seams or mismatched depth.
Question: Is the background composed of detailed tapestries with warm earth tones that blend naturally with the figure without visible edges or inconsistent lighting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the figure into an elegantly dressed noble, evaluate whether the overall posture, facial expression, and clothing proportions remain structurally consistent and visually credible. The original pose is poised and frontal; the edit must preserve this alignment without distorting facial features or body proportions.
Question: Are the facial features, neck, and shoulders proportionally aligned and free from deformation or unnatural stretching?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
