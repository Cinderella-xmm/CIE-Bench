      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the traditional maroon jacket with a tailored Victorian-era suit, this question evaluates whether the new suit’s fabric texture appears consistent and realistic, particularly in terms of weave pattern, sheen, and how light interacts with the material. It checks for unnatural color patches, pixelation, or mismatched shading that could suggest poor rendering.",
      "question": "Does the suit fabric display consistent texture and natural lighting without visible artifacts such as unnatural gloss or patchy areas?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the turban with a top hat adorned with a feather, this question assesses whether the hat is proportionally correct and properly aligned with the head. It checks for issues like floating feathers, incorrect shadow casting, or deformation of the head shape due to the hat placement.",
      "question": "Is the top hat correctly scaled and positioned on the head, with the feather securely attached and casting a natural shadow?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the background to a 19th-century British countryside estate in oil painting style, this question evaluates whether the new background integrates seamlessly with the figure. It checks for visible seams, abrupt transitions, or inconsistencies in lighting and depth between the subject and the background.",
      "question": "Is the background fully integrated with the figure, showing no visible edges or mismatches in lighting or style?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the dhoti with tailored trousers, this question examines whether the trousers follow natural anatomy and fabric behavior, especially around the knees and ankles. It checks for unnatural tightness, folding, or clipping that might indicate poor editing.",
      "question": "Do the trousers drape naturally over the legs with appropriate folds and creases, matching the figure’s posture?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a high collar and cravat, this question evaluates whether the collar fits snugly around the neck without distorting the face or creating unnatural gaps. It also checks if the cravat knot appears physically plausible and does not intersect improperly with the jaw or chin.",
      "question": "Is the high collar and cravat properly aligned with the neck and face, without overlapping or deforming the skin or facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
