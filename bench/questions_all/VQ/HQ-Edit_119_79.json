      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the cat’s body into crystal sculptures using clear and smoky quartz with obsidian accents to retain the calico pattern, evaluate whether the material transition from fur to crystalline structure maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original cat has a distinct calico pattern (orange, black, white), so the edited version must preserve this pattern through the use of brown and black obsidian inlays within the quartz. This requires assessing if the crystal shapes follow the original contours and proportions of the cat's body without geometric distortion.",
      "question": "Does the cat’s body maintain the original shape and proportions when transformed into quartz and obsidian crystals, with no visible warping or unnatural breaks in form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of crafting the eyes from vibrant green emerald crystals, assess whether the replacement of organic eyes with gemstone-like structures preserves anatomical realism and integrates naturally into the face. The original cat has large, round green eyes with visible pupils and reflections; the emerald crystals must replicate these features while maintaining realistic light interaction and surface texture.",
      "question": "Are the emerald crystal eyes positioned correctly within the eye sockets, showing consistent size, shape, and reflective qualities that match the original facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of retaining the seated posture atop a wooden block, evaluate whether the cat’s limbs and tail remain proportionally aligned with the base and support structure. The original image shows the cat sitting upright with paws together and tail curled behind. The crystalline version must preserve this pose without floating or misaligned limbs, ensuring physical rationality and structural consistency.",
      "question": "Are the cat’s front paws and hind legs properly positioned on the wooden block, with no floating or disconnected segments that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using clear and smoky quartz for the body with obsidian accents, assess whether the textures of the crystals appear natural and free from artificial patterns or digital artifacts. The transition between materials should be seamless, especially at edges where quartz meets obsidian, and the surface should show appropriate refraction, transparency, and depth typical of real crystals.",
      "question": "Do the quartz and obsidian surfaces display realistic textures with natural variations in translucency, shading, and edge definition, without pixelation or unnatural smoothness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of keeping the wooden block simple and polished, evaluate whether the wood beneath the cat remains consistent with the original image—showing natural grain, color, and texture—and whether it interacts realistically with the crystal cat. The block should not be altered in shape or scale, and shadows or lighting should reflect plausible interactions between solid wood and transparent crystal.",
      "question": "Is the wooden block visually consistent with the original image in terms of texture, color, and lighting, and does it cast appropriate shadows under the crystal cat without unnatural gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
