      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the rooster's feathers to have iridescent, fiery hues with shimmering gradients, evaluate whether the new feather colors appear naturally layered and textured, maintaining the original feather structure without introducing unnatural sheen, pixelation, or inconsistent gradient transitions. This assesses perceptual quality in terms of material authenticity and texture coherence.",
      "question": "Do the feathers exhibit smooth, continuous gradients of fiery coloration without visible banding, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the tail with trailing plumes transitioning into smoke-like tendrils, assess whether the transition from solid tail feathers to wispy smoke follows a logical flow and maintains spatial continuity. This evaluates structural consistency and visual credibility by checking for sudden breaks, unnatural separation, or floating elements.",
      "question": "Does the tail smoothly transform into smoke-like tendrils without abrupt cutoffs or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding molten gold accents along the wings and head crest, check whether the gold appears embedded within the surface rather than overlaid as a flat or floating layer. This ensures material integration and avoids visual discontinuity between the gold and surrounding feathers.",
      "question": "Are the molten gold accents seamlessly blended into the wing and crest surfaces, showing depth and reflection consistent with metallic material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the eyes to resemble flickering flames, verify that the flame pattern fits within the eye socket without distorting the pupil or iris shape. This checks for anatomical plausibility and avoids unnatural glow spillage or misshapen contours.",
      "question": "Do the flame-like eyes maintain the original eye shape and size, with no distortion of the surrounding facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding ancient rune patterns on the talons, assess whether the runes are proportionally sized, properly aligned with the claw surface, and do not alter the natural curvature or thickness of the talons. This evaluates structural integrity and avoids overwriting or deforming biological features.",
      "question": "Are the rune patterns clearly visible but not oversized or warped, preserving the natural shape and texture of the talons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence across the entire rooster, check whether the body proportions, limb positioning, and overall silhouette remain consistent with the original animal despite fantastical additions. This ensures visual credibility and prevents unnatural scaling or deformation.",
      "question": "Is the roosterâ€™s body posture and limb alignment preserved, with no stretching, compression, or misplacement of limbs relative to the torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
