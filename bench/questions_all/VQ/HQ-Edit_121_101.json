      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the floral embroidery on the hanbok’s sleeves and collar into a paper-cut style with metallic foil accents, this question evaluates whether the stylized floral patterns remain visually coherent and free from jagged edges or unnatural texture transitions. The original image shows soft, embroidered floral designs; the edit must preserve their shape while applying a cut-paper effect and metallic sheen. The focus is on the sleeve areas and collar trim, which are rich in detail.",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the sleeves and collar clearly defined with clean, sharp edges consistent with a paper-cut style, and do they feature uniform metallic foil highlights without smudging or color bleed?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enlarging the bow at the chest of the hanbok, this question checks whether the increased size of the bow disrupts the proportionality of the garment or causes distortion in the surrounding fabric. The original bow is modest in size and centered; enlargement should not cause stretching, warping, or misalignment with the jeogori’s front closure.",
      "question": "Is the enlarged bow positioned centrally and symmetrically on the jeogori, maintaining smooth fabric folds around it without unnatural creasing or geometric distortion?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the background with a stylized version of traditional Korean architecture in a paper-cut aesthetic, this question evaluates whether the architectural elements retain correct roof angles, column spacing, and structural integrity despite the artistic simplification. The original building has layered roofs and red pillars; the edit must preserve these features in a simplified form.",
      "question": "Do the roof lines and structural components of the background architecture maintain proper alignment and perspective, avoiding skewed angles or floating elements that suggest structural inconsistency?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of presenting the entire composition on an embossed leather-bound panel, this question assesses whether the new surface layer appears as a unified base for the design, with no visible gaps, overlapping shadows, or texture mismatches between the panel and the stamped elements. The panel should appear flat and textured, supporting the stamp-like appearance.",
      "question": "Is the embossed leather-bound panel uniformly textured across its surface, with no visible seams or irregularities where the stamped elements meet the background, and does it provide a consistent depth impression?",

The hand must have five fingers, natural skin tone, and correct anatomical proportions. The chain should follow a logical path without clipping or floating.",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the chain have exactly five fingers with natural joint curvature and skin texture, and does the chain follow a continuous, non-intersecting path without breaking or appearing detached?",
