      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of retaining the sandpiper's anatomical accuracy and proportions in a stylized form, this question evaluates whether the bird's body shape, wing placement, leg length, and head orientation remain structurally consistent with the original illustration after being integrated into the packaging design. Any elongation, compression, or misalignment would indicate distortion.",
      "question": "Does the sandpiper's body maintain correct proportions and natural posture, with wings aligned to the torso and legs positioned symmetrically beneath the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating nature-inspired textures without unnatural artifacts, this question assesses whether the textures applied to the packaging surface (e.g., simulated wood, recycled paper) have consistent patterns, smooth gradients, and no visible tiling, pixelation, or color fringing that would suggest digital imperfections.",
      "question": "Are the textures on the packaging surface uniform in pattern and color, with no repeating tiles, sharp edges, or unnatural transitions between areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding text with eco-themed fonts without visual disruption, this question checks whether the text \"Shoreline Explorer Set\" is clearly legible, properly spaced, and does not overlap or obscure key parts of the sandpiper illustration or other design elements, and whether font rendering is smooth without aliasing or blurring.",
      "question": "Is the text \"Shoreline Explorer Set\" fully visible, correctly aligned, and rendered with smooth edges without jagged lines or transparency artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of creating a flat bottom with wave patterns that are geometrically coherent, this question evaluates whether the wave shapes follow natural curvature, are evenly spaced, and do not contain broken lines, sharp corners, or irregular spacing that would suggest poor vector or raster handling.",
      "question": "Do the wave patterns on the flat bottom of the packaging form continuous, flowing curves without gaps, overlaps, or angular distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of including a binocular-shaped cut-out window that reveals part of the kit, this question examines whether the window has clean, symmetrical edges matching the shape of binoculars, and whether the revealed interior content appears logically placed and consistent with the surrounding design, without floating or misaligned elements.",
      "question": "Is the binocular-shaped cut-out window properly shaped with smooth contours, and does it show a clear, non-distorted view of internal kit components without floating or misplaced objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring a seamless transition between the original bird illustration and the packaging elements, this question checks whether there are visible seams, clipping errors, or color mismatches at the boundary between the sandpiper and the background or box elements, which could break the illusion of a unified design.",
      "question": "Is there a smooth, continuous transition between the sandpiper illustration and the surrounding packaging elements, with no visible outlines, shadows, or color discontinuities?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
