      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the elephant figures into elegant, curved bottles with gold-trimmed caps resembling the ears, evaluate whether the structural transformation maintains geometric coherence and visual plausibility. The original elephants have distinct shapes with defined trunks, ears, and bodies; converting them into bottles requires preserving recognizable form while introducing curvature and cap-like structures. The editing must ensure that the transition from animal to bottle does not result in broken or distorted geometry.",
      "question": "Are the body shapes of both elephants smoothly transformed into curved bottle forms without visible breaks or unnatural bends in their silhouettes?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of shaping gold-trimmed caps resembling the elephant's ears, assess whether the ear areas are realistically reinterpreted as bottle caps. The original ears are large and flared, so they must be stylized into cap-like structures with consistent gold trim. This involves evaluating if the material transition (from ear to cap) is seamless and visually coherent.",
      "question": "Do the elephant ears appear as gold-trimmed bottle caps with smooth edges and no misalignment or deformation compared to the rest of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the glittering texture into a glass mosaic pattern on the bottle surface, evaluate whether the texture change preserves detail and realism. The original glittery back section has a speckled appearance; replacing it with a glass mosaic should maintain reflective qualities and uniformity without pixelation or blurring.",
      "question": "Is the glittering texture on the backs of the elephants replaced with a clear, evenly distributed glass mosaic pattern that reflects light naturally without artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a sophisticated brand logo along the trunks and a minimalist fragrance name label, assess whether these new elements are integrated without disrupting the natural flow of the design. The trunk is a narrow, curved surfaceâ€”placing text there requires legibility and alignment without distortion or overlapping.",
      "question": "Are the brand logo and fragrance name label clearly visible along the trunks without stretching, warping, or overlapping with other features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining overall realism and natural appearance during material transformation (e.g., from ceramic-like to glass/metal), evaluate whether the materials used in the edited image (such as glass mosaics, gold trim, and bottle surfaces) appear cohesive and physically plausible. The lighting and reflections should match the assumed materials.",
      "question": "Do the gold trim, glass mosaic patterns, and bottle surfaces exhibit consistent lighting and reflection behavior that aligns with real-world material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
