      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the brown plastic material with soft, vibrant fabrics featuring bold patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow, this question evaluates whether the material transition at the body surface of each figure results in a natural appearance. The original figures have a uniform matte plastic texture; the edited version should show fabric-like softness and pattern continuity without unnatural edges or digital artifacts.",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of all four figures covered in soft-looking fabric with consistent, non-repeating bold patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow, and do they lack visible seams, pixelation, or artificial textures?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the warrior figures into fish-shaped plush toys by exaggerating fins and tails while maintaining dynamic poses, this question checks the structural integrity of the body transformation. Specifically, it assesses whether the legs and arms have been converted into fins and tails in a way that preserves the original stance and avoids geometric distortion such as broken limbs or disproportionate extensions.",
      "question": "Do the legs and arms of all four figures morph into exaggerated fins and tails in a way that maintains their original dynamic poses without broken geometry or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying weapons into fish-related elements or integrating them into the plush design, this question examines whether the weapons (axes, swords, shields) have been transformed into plausible parts of the plush toy (e.g., fin shapes, decorative elements) without appearing disconnected or physically impossible. For example, the large axe held by the top-left figure should now resemble a fish tail or dorsal fin rather than a solid metal object.",
      "question": "Have the weapons of each figure been reimagined as integrated fish-like features (such as fins or tail extensions) without floating or misaligned components that break physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of displaying the plush fish on a sandy fabric surface resembling an underwater scene, this question evaluates the background consistency. The original image has a flat white background; the edited version must show a textured sandy surface with appropriate lighting and depth to simulate an underwater environment. The placement of the figures on this surface must look intentional and grounded.",
      "question": "Is the background a textured sandy fabric surface with subtle shading and depth, and are all four figures positioned naturally on it without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the original dynamic poses during transformation, this question focuses on the hand and limb articulation. The original figures have defined hands gripping weapons; in the plush version, the hands should still appear functional and proportionate even if stylized. The number of fingers should not exceed five, and the grip on any remaining weapon part should look ergonomically plausible.",
      "question": "Do the hands of each figure retain a natural number of fingers (no more than five), maintain ergonomic grip positions, and show no signs of deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
