      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the character’s hairstyle to long, flowing silver locks, this evaluates whether the new hair maintains natural physics such as gravity-induced flow, proper strand separation, and light interaction. The original hair is short and stiff, so the transition to long, silver hair must avoid unnatural stiffness, clipping into the face, or inconsistent lighting.",
      "question": "Does the long silver hair flow naturally without clumping, floating unrealistically, or showing visible seams or rendering artifacts?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the black hooded outfit with a velvet robe adorned with arcane symbols, this checks whether the new material exhibits the expected texture and reflectivity of velvet, and whether the symbols are sharp and integrated into the fabric without appearing pasted or blurred.",
      "question": "Is the velvet robe textured with soft, consistent pile and subtle sheen, and do the arcane symbols appear clearly engraved or embroidered without pixelation or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a fur-trimmed mantle, this assesses whether the fur layer appears dense, voluminous, and physically attached to the robe, rather than flat or artificially layered. The fur should follow the contours of the mantle and interact with light realistically.",
      "question": "Does the fur trim on the mantle have natural density, directionality, and shadowing, and does it seamlessly attach to the robe without gaps or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of equipping the character with a mystical staff featuring runic engravings, this evaluates the staff’s proportions, detail level, and how it interacts with the hand. The hand must grip the staff correctly, with five fingers, natural joint angles, and skin texture consistent with the rest of the character.",
      "question": "Is the staff held by the hand with five distinct fingers, natural curvature, and correct grip pressure, and do the runic engravings appear deeply carved with clear edges and consistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the background to a mystic laboratory, this checks whether the new environment contains coherent elements like scrolls, potions, and lab equipment arranged in a plausible layout with consistent lighting and depth. Shadows and reflections should align with the character’s position.",
      "question": "Are the scrolls and bubbling potions in the background positioned logically within a laboratory setting, with proper depth, lighting, and no floating or misaligned objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility across all edits, this evaluates whether the character and environment share consistent lighting, shadows, and scale. There should be no mismatched shadows, unrealistic occlusions, or abrupt transitions between elements.",
      "question": "Do the character’s shadows match the light source direction in the laboratory background, and are there no floating or disconnected elements such as misplaced objects or unattached textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
