Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of combining this stapler image with its rear view, we need to assess if the stapler's shape and structure remain consistent and authentic after the merge. The focus is on maintaining the overall realism and natural appearance of the stapler's geometry and alignment.
Question: Do the edges and contours of the stapler maintain their smoothness without any jagged or unnatural breaks?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: When combining the front and rear views of the stapler, it's crucial to ensure that the materials and colors appear consistent throughout both views, preserving a cohesive and realistic appearance. The specific visual content of the original stapler suggests a uniform blue color with metallic accents.
Question: Is the blue color and metallic finish of the stapler consistent across both the front and back views with no visible texture discrepancies or artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Combining the stapler's front and back views requires attention to the structural coherence and visual plausibility of the stapler's design. The mechanical parts like hinges and screws need to appear logically connected and physically plausible in both perspectives.
Question: Are the mechanical components such as screws and hinges depicted accurately and consistently between the two views, avoiding any illogical positioning or distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The placement of shadows and highlights should be logical and consistent with the light source, supporting the overall authenticity of the image. The stapler must appear to occupy a three-dimensional space naturally within the combined image.
Question: Do the shadows and highlights on the stapler match the lighting conditions in both views, ensuring a believable three-dimensional effect?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The final composition's layout should provide a coherent and visually credible side-by-side comparison of the stapler's front and back views. Itâ€™s important to ensure that the merged image does not introduce elements that seem out of place or disrupt the intended presentation.
Question: Is the layout of the stapler's side-by-side views clear and uncluttered, with no distracting or misplaced elements disrupting the visual flow?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
