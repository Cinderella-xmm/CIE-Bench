Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "adding butterfly wings to the woman’s back and enlarging them with intricate textures", evaluate whether the wings are seamlessly integrated into the image without visible artifacts or distortions. The wings must maintain natural proportions relative to the woman's body, and their texture should appear consistent with real butterfly wings, avoiding unnatural patterns or color gradients.
Question: Are the butterfly wings proportionally sized relative to the woman’s body and positioned naturally behind her shoulders without overlapping or distorting her silhouette?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "adding intricate textures to the enlarged wings", assess whether the surface details of the wings (such as veins, color gradients, and edge definition) appear realistic and continuous, without pixelation, blurring, or artificial repetition that would suggest low-quality rendering.
Question: Do the butterfly wings display consistent and detailed textures across their surfaces, with no visible artifacts such as jagged edges, repeated patterns, or unnatural shading?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "cartoonizing her figure while retaining structural coherence", evaluate whether the woman’s body proportions remain anatomically plausible despite stylization. Focus on limbs, head-to-body ratio, and facial features to ensure no distortion or unnatural elongation.
Question: Does the woman’s body maintain natural proportions, with no exaggerated limbs, distorted joints, or disproportionate head size that would compromise visual credibility?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "accentuating the red dress with gold embroidery", assess whether the added embroidery appears physically plausible—texturally distinct from the knit fabric, properly aligned with the dress’s structure, and not floating or misaligned. Check for unnatural highlights or lack of depth.
Question: Is the gold embroidery on the red dress clearly defined, textured appropriately, and integrated into the fabric without appearing flat, misplaced, or disconnected from the material?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "placing each month on a different wing and arranging the calendar on a wooden panel with floral inlay", evaluate whether the text and decorative elements (months, wood panel, floral inlays) are logically placed and visually coherent. The layout should not interfere with the wings’ natural form or create impossible spatial relationships.
Question: Are the months displayed on the wings clearly legible, properly aligned, and integrated into the wing design without disrupting the wing’s shape or causing visual conflicts such as overlapping or floating text?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
