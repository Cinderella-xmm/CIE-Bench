      "question": "Are the wooden beams and roof supports rendered as consistent geometric shapes with sharp, clean edges and no warped or fractured sections?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of stylizing the moon as a radiant circle, assess whether the moon appears as a perfectly circular object with a smooth surface and evenly distributed radiance, without pixelation, irregular contours, or mismatched lighting effects that could imply digital artifacts.",
      "question": "Is the moon a perfectly round shape with a smooth surface and uniform glow around its edge, without jagged outlines or uneven brightness?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting plants into symmetric patterns, determine whether the foliage in the foreground and along the hillside has been replaced with repeating, balanced geometric designs that maintain visual harmony and avoid unnatural gaps, overlapping, or misaligned segments.",
      "question": "Are the plants in the foreground and background arranged in symmetrical, repeating patterns without irregular spacing or fragmented shapes?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying metallic tones with gold and silver accents, evaluate whether the surfaces of the cabin’s wood and glass reflect metallic finishes consistently, with appropriate highlights and shadows that match the light source, and without unnatural color shifts or loss of texture detail.",
      "question": "Do the wooden surfaces and glass panes display metallic gold and silver accents with consistent sheen and reflection, without color bleeding or missing texture details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding stylized clouds and bold dynamic window details, check whether the newly introduced cloud forms follow a cohesive design language with clean lines and proper integration into the sky, and whether the window frame and curtain details feature dynamic, stylized lines without distorting the original proportions or introducing floating elements.",
      "question": "Are the stylized clouds positioned above the horizon with smooth, flowing outlines and do the window frames show bold, angular lines that align with the architectural style without breaking the window’s structural integrity?",

        "Yes",
