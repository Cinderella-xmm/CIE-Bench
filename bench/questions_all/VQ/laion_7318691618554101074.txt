Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction involves transforming the makeup brushes into sculpted crystal wands with gemstone tops. This transformation affects the shape, material, and texture of each brush. The original brushes have soft bristles and black handles; replacing them with crystalline structures requires careful attention to maintain visual coherence and avoid unnatural transitions or distortions in geometry. The new crystal wands must appear structurally plausible and not exhibit jagged edges, inconsistent transparency, or mismatched proportions relative to their original size.
-Sub requirement 1: Transform the makeup brushes into crystal wands with gemstone tips—evaluate whether the new forms retain geometric consistency, proportionality, and realistic material appearance (e.g., refractive qualities, smooth surfaces), avoiding artifacts like pixelation, unnatural sharpness, or deformation.

-Thinking process 2: The jar is replaced with a transparent crystal vase featuring etched floral patterns. The original glass container has a simple cylindrical shape with a lace band and pearls inside. The new vase must preserve structural integrity while introducing detailed etching that matches the elegance of the scene. The transition from plain glass to etched crystal should not introduce broken lines, uneven depth, or inconsistent translucency.
-Sub requirement 2: Replace the glass jar with a crystal vase—assess whether the new vase maintains proper symmetry, clarity, and realistic surface detail (such as engraved patterns), and whether the etched designs are coherent and physically plausible without appearing digitally overlaid or distorted.

-Thinking process 3: The lace band around the jar is transformed into a carved crystal ribbon. The original lace is delicate and fabric-like, with a white base and blue floral pattern. Converting this into a solid crystal form requires preserving the design’s complexity while ensuring it appears as a continuous, three-dimensional object rather than a flat overlay. Any breakage in continuity or loss of fine detail would compromise realism.
-Sub requirement 3: Convert the lace band into a carved crystal ribbon—check if the ribbon maintains the original pattern's structure but in a crystalline medium, with no visible seams, flattening, or loss of intricate details such as floral motifs or edge definition.

-Thinking process 4: The arrangement is placed on a mirrored surface to enhance elegance and reflectivity. The original image shows a glass table with metal supports. Introducing a mirror surface changes the reflection properties and lighting behavior. The reflections must be consistent with the environment—accurate in angle, clarity, and content—and should not show misaligned or ghosted elements.
-Sub requirement 4: Place the arrangement on a mirrored surface—verify that the reflection beneath the vase is symmetrical, correctly aligned with the objects above, and displays appropriate light interaction (e.g., specular highlights, distortion-free imagery), without double images or incorrect depth cues.

-Thinking process 5: The pearls inside the jar remain present but are now within a crystal vase. Their appearance should not change significantly unless affected by the new material’s optical properties. However, any shift in color, clarity, or spacing could indicate artifacting or poor integration.
-Sub requirement 5: Retain the pearls inside the vase—ensure that the pearls maintain uniformity in size, spacing, and luster, and that they do not appear warped, compressed, or unnaturally lit due to the new surrounding material or lighting conditions.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the makeup brushes into crystal wands with gemstone tops, evaluate whether the new shapes maintain proportional consistency with the original brush sizes and whether the materials (crystal and gemstones) appear natural and free from artifacts such as jagged edges, unnatural transparency, or inconsistent surface textures.
Question: Do the crystal wands have smooth, continuous surfaces with consistent refraction and no visible digital artifacts or irregularities in shape?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the glass jar with a transparent crystal vase featuring etched floral patterns, assess whether the vase exhibits symmetrical structure, realistic translucency, and clearly defined etched patterns that follow natural depth cues and do not appear flattened or artificially pasted.
Question: Are the etched floral patterns on the crystal vase evenly distributed, continuous, and visually integrated into the surface without breaking lines or inconsistent shading?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the lace band into a carved crystal ribbon, check whether the ribbon retains the original floral design in a three-dimensional, solid form, with no loss of detail, gaps, or artificial seams that suggest layering or poor rendering.
Question: Is the carved crystal ribbon fully formed with intact floral motifs and no visible breaks, overlaps, or flattened areas that suggest a 2D-to-3D conversion error?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the arrangement on a mirrored surface, verify that the reflection beneath the vase accurately mirrors the objects above, including correct angles, clarity, and alignment, without distortions such as ghosting, misalignment, or missing elements.
Question: Does the reflection on the mirrored surface show a clear, undistorted image of the crystal vase and its contents, with proper symmetry and matching lighting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of retaining the pearls inside the vase, evaluate whether the pearls maintain their original spherical shape, spacing, and reflective quality, and whether they appear unaffected by unnatural lighting or compression caused by the new crystal environment.
Question: Are the pearls uniformly sized, evenly spaced, and free from warping or blurring that suggests compression or incorrect rendering due to the crystal vase?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
