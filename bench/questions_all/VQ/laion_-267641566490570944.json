      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the tallest central peak into a dragon head with crystal horns and serpentine eyes, this position involves adding non-natural elements (crystal horns, eyes) to a natural rock formation. The evaluation focuses on whether these added features maintain proportional scaling relative to the mountain size, have realistic surface textures (e.g., transparent crystalline structure), and blend seamlessly with the rock surface without visible seams or unnatural highlights.",
      "question": "Are the crystal horns on the dragon head proportionally sized relative to the mountain peak and do they exhibit natural refraction and transparency consistent with crystalline material?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of morphing surrounding ridges into sinuous dragon bodies, this involves reshaping the mountain contours to resemble biological forms. The evaluation checks whether the curves follow smooth, continuous paths resembling organic anatomy, avoiding sharp kinks or unnatural bulges that would contradict physical realism.",
      "question": "Do the ridge lines forming the dragon body show smooth, flowing transitions without abrupt angular bends or disproportionate thickness changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding rocky scales and moss-covered spines along the ridges, this evaluates whether the textures applied to the mountain surfaces mimic real geological and biological patterns. The focus is on whether the scale pattern follows natural fractal distribution, and moss appears organically distributed rather than uniformly tiled or repeated.",
      "question": "Are the rocky scales and moss-covered spines distributed in a way that mimics natural erosion and plant growth patterns without repeating textures or uniform spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of extending ridges into misty clouds as coiled limbs or tails, this assesses the visual integration of solid forms into atmospheric haze. The evaluation checks whether the transition from solid ridge to cloud is gradual and maintains depth cues, preventing hard edges or sudden disappearance of form.",
      "question": "Does the dragon tail fade into the mist with a soft gradient, maintaining visibility of form through haze without sharp cutoffs or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring overall scene coherence, this evaluates whether lighting and shadow relationships remain consistent across the entire image, especially at the junctions between dragon features and natural terrain. The focus is on whether shadows cast by the dragon head or body align with the light source direction and whether reflections or highlights are physically plausible.",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dragon features align with the sun's position in the sky and match the lighting on surrounding mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
