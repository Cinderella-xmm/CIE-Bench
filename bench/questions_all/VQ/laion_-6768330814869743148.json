    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming pastries into pop art with bold outlines and bright colors, evaluate whether the shapes of the pastries (such as the round madeleines and rectangular bread slices) retain their original geometric integrity. Specifically, check if the contours remain smooth and proportionally accurate despite the added outlines and color enhancements.",
      "question": "Do the pastries in the edited image maintain their original shapes without distorted or stretched forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enhancing bread textures with bold outlines and bright colors, assess whether the internal structure of the bread (such as crumb texture and cut surfaces) appears artificially exaggerated or simplified. Focus on whether the texture looks like a painted version rather than a realistic representation.",
      "question": "Are the bread slices' internal textures clearly visible and consistent with real bread, or do they appear overly stylized with uniform patterns that lack natural variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of elevating muffin papers to geometric patterns, examine whether the paper liners around the muffins have been replaced with rigid, flat geometric shapes that ignore real-world folding and shadowing. Check for continuity between the muffin base and liner.",
      "question": "Do the muffin liners show clear geometric patterns that still align with the shape of the muffins and do not float or detach from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming wooden trays into checkerboard surfaces, evaluate whether the wood grain has been replaced with a consistent checkerboard pattern that respects the depth and perspective of the trays. Look for abrupt transitions or flatness that contradicts the 3D structure.",
      "question": "Is the checkerboard pattern applied uniformly across the tray surfaces without breaking the perceived depth or causing unnatural flatness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing background cups with abstract, colorful shapes, verify whether the new shapes maintain a logical arrangement relative to the table surface and other objects. Check for alignment, spacing, and whether they appear to be placed on the same plane as the original cups.",
      "question": "Are the abstract shapes in the background positioned in a way that matches the depth and alignment of the original cup stack, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
