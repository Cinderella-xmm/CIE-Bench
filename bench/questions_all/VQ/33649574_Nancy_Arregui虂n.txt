Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the rooster into a phoenix-like creature, which involves significant changes to its feathers, tail, eyes, and talons. These modifications include adding iridescent, fiery hues with shimmering gradients, replacing the tail with smoke-like tendrils, adding molten gold accents on wings and crest, changing eye appearance to flickering flames, and introducing ancient rune patterns on talons. Each of these edits affects different anatomical regions of the rooster as seen in the original image—specifically the head (crest and eyes), body (feathers and wings), tail, and feet (talons). Since these are major transformations involving material substitution (e.g., feathers → iridescent plumes), structural replacement (tail → smoke tendrils), and texture addition (runes), they must be evaluated for visual coherence, physical plausibility, and absence of artifacts. The core structure of the rooster must remain intact while new elements are added in a way that preserves anatomical consistency and avoids distortions such as unnatural textures, broken geometry, or misplaced features.

-Sub requirement 1: Modify the color and texture of the rooster's feathers to include iridescent, fiery hues with shimmering gradients—assess whether this change maintains natural feather-like structure and avoids artificial or pixelated textures.
-Sub requirement 2: Replace the rooster’s tail with extravagant trailing plumes transitioning into smoke-like tendrils—evaluate whether the transition from solid feathers to smoke is smooth and physically plausible without breaking geometric continuity.
-Sub requirement 3: Add molten gold accents along the wings and head crest—check if the gold appears integrated into the surface without floating or clashing with surrounding materials.
-Sub requirement 4: Transform the rooster’s eyes to resemble flickering flames—determine if the flame effect respects ocular anatomy and does not distort the eye shape or introduce unnatural glow artifacts.
-Sub requirement 5: Add ancient rune patterns on the talons—verify that the runes are proportionally sized, correctly aligned on the foot surface, and do not disrupt the natural shape or texture of the claws.
-Sub requirement 6: Ensure all edited elements maintain structural coherence with the original rooster’s body proportions and posture—confirm no stretching, warping, or misalignment occurs during transformation.
-Sub requirement 7: Avoid introduction of unnatural textures, jagged edges, or loss of fine detail (e.g., feather barbs, skin texture) due to digital manipulation.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of modifying the rooster's feathers to have iridescent, fiery hues with shimmering gradients, evaluate whether the new feather colors appear naturally layered and textured, maintaining the original feather structure without introducing unnatural sheen, pixelation, or inconsistent gradient transitions. This assesses perceptual quality in terms of material authenticity and texture coherence.
Question: Do the feathers exhibit smooth, continuous gradients of fiery coloration without visible banding, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the tail with trailing plumes transitioning into smoke-like tendrils, assess whether the transition from solid tail feathers to wispy smoke follows a logical flow and maintains spatial continuity. This evaluates structural consistency and visual credibility by checking for sudden breaks, unnatural separation, or floating elements.
Question: Does the tail smoothly transform into smoke-like tendrils without abrupt cutoffs or disconnected segments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding molten gold accents along the wings and head crest, check whether the gold appears embedded within the surface rather than overlaid as a flat or floating layer. This ensures material integration and avoids visual discontinuity between the gold and surrounding feathers.
Question: Are the molten gold accents seamlessly blended into the wing and crest surfaces, showing depth and reflection consistent with metallic material?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of changing the eyes to resemble flickering flames, verify that the flame pattern fits within the eye socket without distorting the pupil or iris shape. This checks for anatomical plausibility and avoids unnatural glow spillage or misshapen contours.
Question: Do the flame-like eyes maintain the original eye shape and size, with no distortion of the surrounding facial features?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding ancient rune patterns on the talons, assess whether the runes are proportionally sized, properly aligned with the claw surface, and do not alter the natural curvature or thickness of the talons. This evaluates structural integrity and avoids overwriting or deforming biological features.
Question: Are the rune patterns clearly visible but not oversized or warped, preserving the natural shape and texture of the talons?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence across the entire rooster, check whether the body proportions, limb positioning, and overall silhouette remain consistent with the original animal despite fantastical additions. This ensures visual credibility and prevents unnatural scaling or deformation.
Question: Is the rooster’s body posture and limb alignment preserved, with no stretching, compression, or misplacement of limbs relative to the torso?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
