      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the wooden bookshelf and books with LEGO blocks while preserving layout and proportions, this question evaluates whether the material transformation from wood to plastic maintains natural appearance and avoids unnatural textures. The focus is on the surface texture of the LEGO blocks—specifically whether they appear smooth and consistent with plastic rather than retaining wood grain or showing mixed textures.",
      "question": "Do the LEGO blocks forming the bookshelf and books have a uniform, smooth plastic texture throughout, with no residual wood grain or mixed material appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using earthy-toned LEGO bricks to match the original color palette, this question assesses whether the color transition from the original image’s warm browns and tans to LEGO bricks is seamless and free of unnatural color shifts. It checks if the colors are consistent across all books and shelves without sudden contrasts or non-matching hues.",
      "question": "Are the colors of the LEGO blocks uniformly earthy-toned (e.g., browns, tans, dark reds) and consistent with the original bookshelf’s color scheme, without any unexpected or jarring color deviations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replicating intricate carvings using darker LEGO bricks, this question evaluates whether the detailed designs on the spines and shelf edges are accurately represented in the LEGO version. It focuses on whether the darker bricks form coherent patterns that match the original ornamental motifs and whether these patterns are sharp and well-aligned.",
      "question": "Are the darker LEGO bricks used for carvings clearly aligned and shaped to replicate the original decorative patterns on the spines and shelf edges without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of tapering the tower at the top, this question checks the geometric integrity of the structure. It evaluates whether the tapering is gradual and symmetrical, maintaining structural consistency and avoiding abrupt breaks or uneven narrowing that would violate physical plausibility.",
      "question": "Does the top of the LEGO tower taper smoothly and symmetrically from the base upward, without jagged edges, irregular steps, or disproportionate narrowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the background with a plain, muted backdrop, this question assesses whether the original textured wallpaper has been fully removed and replaced with a uniform, neutral background. It ensures there are no visible remnants of the original pattern or lighting inconsistencies that could distract from the LEGO structure.",
      "question": "Is the background behind the LEGO tower completely plain and muted, with no traces of the original textured wallpaper or lighting artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining uniform block size and alignment, this question evaluates whether all LEGO bricks are consistently sized and properly connected, without floating, misaligned, or overlapping pieces that would break structural coherence.",
      "question": "Are all LEGO blocks aligned perfectly in rows and columns, with no gaps, overlaps, or floating pieces that disrupt the modular structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
