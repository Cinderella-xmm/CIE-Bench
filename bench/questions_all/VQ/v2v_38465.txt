Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "replacing the surfers with pandas while maintaining the sunset and beach setting intact," assess if the replacement maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility without introducing unnatural textures or distortions.
Question: Are the pandas holding the surfboards seamlessly integrated into the scene without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of "avoiding distortion such as damaged geometric shapes," evaluate if the surfboards retain their original shape and proportions after the replacement.
Question: Do the surfboards held by the pandas maintain their original shape and proportions without any distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of "maintaining the overall sense of reality and natural appearance," check if the pandas' posture and positioning appear natural within the context of the beach and sunset.
Question: Do the pandas' postures and positioning appear natural and consistent with the beach and sunset environment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the sub requirement of "retaining core elements to ensure structural consistency and visual credibility," verify if the sunset and beach setting remain unchanged and visually credible.
Question: Has the sunset and beach setting remained intact and visually credible without any alterations or distortions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "ensuring the proportion and physical rationality of each element," assess if the pandas' size relative to the surfboards and the environment is realistic.
Question: Are the pandas' sizes relative to the surfboards and the environment proportionally realistic and physically plausible?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
