      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving the original geometric structure during material transformation, specifically focusing on the triangular overlays and mesh panels, this question evaluates whether the shape and alignment of these elements remain intact after being rendered in wood. The original shoe has distinct angular overlays forming a continuous pattern; any distortion would break structural coherence.",
      "question": "Are the triangular overlay shapes on the side of the shoe clearly defined and aligned correctly, without warped edges or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying realistic wood grain patterns across all surfaces, this question checks for consistency and naturalness of texture, especially in high-detail areas like the mesh upper and synthetic overlays where fine texture is critical.",
      "question": "Do the wood grain lines flow naturally across the shoe's surface, following the contours of the panels and laces, without repeating or pixelated patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving the lacing system's form and spatial accuracy, this question assesses whether the laces are rendered as carved wooden cords with correct thickness and placement relative to the eyelets and tongue.",
      "question": "Are the laces depicted as solid wooden strands with consistent width and proper threading through the eyelets, maintaining their original path and tension?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using dark and light wood tones to reflect the original black and gray shades, this question evaluates whether the tonal contrast enhances depth and dimensionality without appearing flat or oversaturated.",
      "question": "Do the darker and lighter wood tones create a clear distinction between the shoe's main body and highlights, such as the toe cap and midsole, without unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving brand logos in the carving, this question checks whether the text elements (Salomon, Speedcross, Contagrip, LT) remain legible and properly integrated into the wood surface without distortion.",
      "question": "Are the brand names and logos (e.g., \"Salomon\", \"Speedcross\", \"Contagrip\") clearly readable and accurately positioned on the shoe, with clean edges and no blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of realistically rendering the outsole with depth and texture, this question evaluates whether the tread pattern and toe cap are carved with sufficient detail and proportion to match the original shoe’s design.",
      "question": "Does the outsole feature deep, well-defined treads and a reinforced toe cap, with consistent depth and spacing that matches the original shoe’s geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the wooden shoe on a minimalist gallery shelf, this question assesses the overall composition, lighting, and shadow to determine if the scene supports the perception of a real carved sculpture.",
      "question": "Is the wooden shoe placed on a clean, flat shelf with soft shadows beneath it, suggesting a stable and realistic display environment without floating or misaligned positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
