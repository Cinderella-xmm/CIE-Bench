      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the ship and seascape into a miniature 3D nautical globe, evaluate whether the transformation maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image features a large sailing ship floating on calm water with a full moon in the background. The editing instruction requires encapsulating this scene into a spherical globe format. This involves significant geometric reshaping, so it's critical to assess whether the shipâ€™s proportions, hull curvature, and spatial relationships remain consistent within the new spherical form.",
      "question": "Does the ship retain its original structural shape and proportion when rendered as part of a spherical globe, without visible warping or stretching of the hull or sails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of encapsulating the scene within a clear glass dome mounted on a polished wood base engraved with compass designs, evaluate whether the materials and textures are realistically represented. The glass dome must appear transparent and reflective, while the wooden base should show natural grain and engraving detail. The transition between the globe and base must be physically plausible.",
      "question": "Is the glass dome transparent with realistic reflections and refractions, and does the wooden base display natural wood grain and intricate compass engravings without pixelation or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding miniature sea creatures swimming below the ship, evaluate whether these elements are integrated naturally into the underwater environment. The sea creatures should be proportionally small relative to the ship and positioned in a way that suggests movement through water, with appropriate lighting and depth cues.",
      "question": "Are the sea creatures clearly visible beneath the ship, properly scaled, and positioned in a manner consistent with underwater motion, without appearing floating unnaturally or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enhancing the sails with delicate fabric textures, evaluate whether the added textures appear seamless and consistent with real-world sailcloth. The texture should include subtle folds, creases, and light interaction that match the illumination from the moon and sky.",
      "question": "Do the sails exhibit fine fabric details such as wrinkles and weave patterns that align with the lighting direction and do not show unnatural seams or repeating patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating swirling, ethereal clouds suspended inside the dome, evaluate whether these clouds maintain a natural appearance and dynamic flow within the enclosed space. They should not intersect improperly with the ship or dome structure and should appear softly illuminated by ambient light.",
      "question": "Are the internal clouds smoothly shaped and distributed within the dome without clipping into the ship or glass surface, and do they have soft edges and luminous quality consistent with being lit from above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
