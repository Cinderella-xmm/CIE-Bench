Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the guitar into a heroic comic book character named 'Strum-Crusader'. This involves reinterpreting the guitar's physical structure as part of a humanoid figure. The original image shows a standard acoustic guitar with a wooden body, neck, headstock, strings, and soundhole. The transformation must preserve the core shape of the guitar while introducing new elements such as armor-like textures, dynamic lines, muscle strands from strings, and a luminous cape. Each of these additions must be evaluated for visual coherence, material realism, and structural plausibility.

-Sub requirement 1: The guitar body is to be transformed into an armored torso; evaluate whether this conversion maintains structural consistency and visual credibility by preserving the original body’s outline while adding metallic texture without distorting its geometry.

-Sub requirement 2: The wood grain of the guitar body must be stylized as a deep mahogany metallic finish; assess whether this texture change introduces unnatural patterns or loss of fine detail compared to the original wood grain.

-Sub requirement 3: Dynamic illustrative lines must be added to enhance the comic book style; check if these lines are evenly spaced, consistent in thickness, and do not intersect or distort existing features like the soundhole or bridge.

-Sub requirement 4: The guitar strings are to be reimagined as muscle strands wrapping the body; determine if their path follows anatomical logic and remains physically plausible when stretched across the body contours.

-Sub requirement 5: A luminous cape must flow from the neck with sound wave motifs and a bright emblem on the headstock; verify that the cape’s shape flows naturally from the neck, does not violate physics (e.g., no floating or abrupt cutoffs), and that the sound wave patterns are coherent and not distorted.

-Sub requirement 6: The emblem on the headstock must be clearly visible and integrated without obscuring the brand name or tuning pegs; ensure it is proportionally sized and stylistically consistent with the rest of the design.

-Sub requirement 7: All modifications must avoid artifacts such as jagged edges, color bleeding, or pixelation, especially at transitions between original and added elements.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the guitar body into an armored torso while maintaining structural consistency, this question evaluates whether the overall shape of the guitar body has been preserved and whether any geometric distortion (such as warped curves or misaligned edges) occurred during the transformation.
Question: Does the outline of the guitar body remain intact and undistorted after being converted into an armored torso?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of emphasizing the wood grain as a metallic, deep mahogany finish, this question checks whether the texture modification retains the natural pattern of the wood grain while introducing a metallic sheen without creating unnatural highlights, smudging, or texture repetition.
Question: Is the metallic finish applied to the guitar body consistent with the original wood grain pattern, showing no signs of artificial texture tiling or unnatural reflections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding dynamic illustrative lines, this question evaluates whether these lines are smoothly drawn, follow the contours of the guitar, and do not interfere with key features like the soundhole or bridge, ensuring they contribute to the comic style without breaking visual coherence.
Question: Are the illustrative lines evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the guitar's curvature without overlapping or cutting through structural elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of reinterpreting the guitar strings as muscle strands wrapping the body, this question assesses whether the string paths maintain logical tension and continuity, following the body’s surface without appearing disconnected or unnaturally bent.
Question: Do the strings appear as continuous, taut muscle strands that follow the body’s contour without kinks, gaps, or floating segments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of drawing a luminous cape flowing from the neck with sound wave motifs, this question evaluates whether the cape’s shape and motion suggest natural flow, and whether the sound waves are properly rendered without distortion or misalignment.
Question: Does the cape extend naturally from the neck, showing smooth folds and consistent sound wave patterns along its length without abrupt changes or breaks?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a bright emblem on the headstock, this question checks whether the emblem is clearly defined, proportionally sized, and positioned without obscuring the tuning pegs or brand logo, ensuring integration into the design.
Question: Is the emblem on the headstock fully visible, correctly aligned, and not overlapping with the tuning pegs or brand name?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q7: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts such as jagged edges or color bleeding, this question evaluates the quality of blending between original and added elements, particularly at boundaries like the edge of the cape, the transition from strings to muscle strands, and around the soundhole.
Question: Are there any visible artifacts such as pixelation, color bleeding, or sharp discontinuities at the junctions between original guitar parts and added elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
