Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the original figure into an anime-style tutorial infographic titled “Master the Power Jump” with three sequential steps. This involves adding new elements such as text captions, step-by-step illustrations, and a stylized design aesthetic (bold outlines, vibrant colors, energetic fonts). The original figure is in mid-air, performing a dynamic leap, which must be preserved or adapted to represent each step. The core character’s pose and anatomy are central to maintaining structural coherence. Key areas for editing include the character's position in each step (starting pose, leap, mid-air adjustment), the addition of simplified figures for instructional purposes, and the integration of textual and graphic overlays. These changes may affect realism if not rendered consistently with the original style and proportions. Attention must be paid to whether added illustrations maintain anatomical accuracy, proportionality, and visual plausibility. The use of bold outlines and vibrant colors should not introduce unnatural textures or distortions. The placement of text and auxiliary figures must not interfere with the main subject’s integrity or create visual clutter that compromises clarity.

-Sub requirement 1: Adding a simple figure in the starting pose (kneeling with bent arms back) — evaluate whether this new figure maintains anatomical correctness, proportion relative to the main character, and natural limb positioning without distortion or unnatural joint angles.
-Sub requirement 2: Depicting the "Leap Attack" phase with explosive movement — assess whether the motion lines, posture, and muscle tension are consistent with physical dynamics and do not introduce exaggerated or broken geometry.
-Sub requirement 3: Illustrating "Mid-Air Adjustment" with tucked knees — check whether the knee tuck is anatomically plausible, limbs remain intact, and no deformation occurs in joints or muscles.
-Sub requirement 4: Integrating bold outlines, vibrant blues and whites, and energetic fonts — determine whether these stylistic elements enhance clarity without introducing artifacts like jagged edges, color bleeding, or inconsistent shading.
-Sub requirement 5: Ensuring all added elements (text, figures, motion cues) are spatially coherent and do not overlap or obscure critical parts of the original figure in a way that breaks visual logic.
-Sub requirement 6: Maintaining structural consistency between the original figure and any duplicated or modified poses — verify that scaling, perspective, and body proportions remain uniform across steps.
-Sub requirement 7: Avoiding unnatural textures or loss of fine details in skin, clothing, or hair when applying anime-style effects — ensure materials retain their original fidelity where possible.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a simple figure in the starting pose (kneeling with bent arms back), this new figure must be positioned in the same scene space as the original character. The question evaluates whether the added figure has correct limb proportions, natural joint alignment, and appropriate hand structure (five fingers, ergonomic shape) without deformation or extra digits.
Question: Does the added kneeling figure have five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no distorted joints?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of depicting the "Leap Attack" phase with explosive movement, the character’s posture must reflect dynamic propulsion. This includes proper extension of limbs, muscle definition, and balance in mid-leap. The question checks for geometric integrity in the legs and torso during the leap.
Question: Are the legs and torso of the leaping figure properly extended and aligned to reflect forward momentum without broken or warped limbs?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of illustrating "Mid-Air Adjustment" with tucked knees, the character's legs must show a compact tuck with bent knees close to the chest. The question evaluates whether the knee bend is anatomically feasible and whether the thighs and calves maintain realistic proportions without overlapping or flattening.
Question: Are the knees tucked tightly toward the chest with natural curvature and no visible deformation in the leg muscles?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of integrating bold outlines and vibrant colors (blues and whites), the question assesses whether the coloring remains consistent across the figure and added elements, with clean line work and no color bleed or pixelation along edges.
Question: Do the bold outlines follow the contours of the figure smoothly without jagged edges or color spillage into adjacent areas?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of ensuring spatial coherence between all elements, the question checks whether the added text captions and step indicators are placed in non-obstructive positions and do not overlap critical features like the face or limbs in a way that distorts perception.
Question: Are the text captions and step numbers positioned so they do not cover key facial features or limbs of the main figure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency across poses, the question evaluates whether the size, scale, and proportions of the character remain uniform across the three illustrated steps, especially when comparing the original figure to the simplified versions.
Question: Are the simplified figures in each step scaled consistently with the original character and aligned in perspective?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
