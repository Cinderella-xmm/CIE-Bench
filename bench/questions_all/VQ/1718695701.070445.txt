Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the capybara into a metallic sculpture with a polished bronze surface. This involves replacing the natural fur texture with an engraved, metallic appearance while preserving anatomical structure. The transformation affects the entire body surface, requiring attention to material consistency, texture coherence, and structural fidelity. The original image shows a soft-furred capybara with detailed facial features, so converting this to bronze must maintain the correct proportions and avoid distortions in facial geometry or skin folds.
-Sub requirement 1: Replace the fur texture across the entire body with a polished bronze surface that maintains anatomical accuracy and avoids unnatural warping or loss of fine details such as whiskers or facial contours.

-<Thinking Process 2>: The knitted hat in the original image is blue and textured with a pom-pom on top. It must be replaced with an intricately detailed helmet made of matching bronze. This change involves altering the shape and material of the headwear while ensuring it aligns with the new metallic theme and does not introduce geometric inconsistencies or mismatched proportions relative to the head.
-Sub requirement 2: Replace the knitted hat with a bronze helmet that matches the scale and positioning of the original hat, ensuring no distortion in shape, proportion, or attachment point to the head.

-<Thinking Process 3>: The sunglasses in the original image are blue-framed with dark lenses. They must be transformed into elegant glass lenses set in bronze frames. This involves changing both the material and design of the glasses while maintaining their position over the eyes and ensuring they remain visually plausible on the metallic face.
-Sub requirement 3: Modify the sunglasses into bronze-framed glass lenses that retain proper alignment with the eye sockets and do not cause misalignment or unnatural reflections.

-<Thinking Process 4>: The original image includes a blue knitted sweater with visible stitching and shoulder straps. The instruction specifies maintaining fur details with engraved lines, which implies that the sweater should also be converted to a bronze version with engraved patterns. This requires preserving the garmentâ€™s structure and fit while applying a metallic texture.
-Sub requirement 4: Convert the sweater into a bronze garment with engraved lines that match the original shape and placement, ensuring no deformation or misalignment with the body.

-<Thinking Process 5>: The capybara must be positioned on an understated marble base for display. This introduces a new element (the base) beneath the figure. The base must be physically plausible in size and position, supporting the sculpture without appearing floating or disproportionately sized.
-Sub requirement 5: Add a marble base under the sculpture that is proportionally sized and properly aligned with the feet or lower body, ensuring visual stability and grounding.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the fur texture with a polished bronze surface across the entire body, this question evaluates whether the transformation maintains anatomical accuracy and avoids unnatural distortions in facial features such as the nose, mouth, and whiskers. The original image has clear facial details, so any metalization should preserve these structures without flattening or warping them.
Question: Are the facial features such as the nose, mouth, and whiskers preserved in shape and position after conversion to bronze, without visible distortion or loss of detail?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the knitted hat with a bronze helmet, this question checks whether the new helmet maintains the same scale and placement as the original hat, and whether its shape is structurally coherent and free from geometric errors such as sharp edges or misaligned seams.
Question: Is the bronze helmet properly scaled and positioned on the head, with smooth transitions at the edges and no visible gaps or misalignments with the skull?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of modifying the sunglasses into bronze-framed glass lenses, this question assesses whether the new glasses maintain proper alignment with the eye sockets and whether the lens material appears consistent with glass (e.g., reflective, transparent) and the frame with bronze (e.g., metallic sheen, thickness).
Question: Do the bronze-framed glasses sit correctly over the eyes without shifting or overlapping incorrectly, and do the lenses show realistic glass-like reflection and transparency?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the sweater into a bronze garment with engraved lines, this question evaluates whether the sweater retains its original shape and fit on the body, and whether the engraved patterns appear continuous and plausible on a metallic surface without breaking or distorting the fabric-like structure.
Question: Does the bronze sweater maintain the original shape and shoulder strap placement, with engraved lines that follow the contours of the garment without breaking or appearing artificial?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a marble base beneath the sculpture, this question checks whether the base is proportionally sized and properly grounded under the figure, ensuring it supports the sculpture without appearing disconnected or floating.
Question: Is the marble base positioned directly beneath the sculpture, with appropriate contact points and no visible gap between the feet and the base, and is it proportionally sized to support the figure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
