Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of retaining the bike and natural scene while maintaining a clean and minimalist aesthetic, evaluate if the overall realism and natural appearance of the bike and its environment have been preserved. Focus on potential artifacts or unnatural textures introduced during the editing process.
Question: Are the textures on the bike frame and surrounding grass natural, without any visible artifacts or unnatural color variations?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility of the retained core elements, assess whether the proportions and shapes of the bike remain consistent with physical reality after the editing. Pay attention to the wheels and frame geometry.
Question: Do the wheels and frame of the bike maintain their correct proportions and geometry, avoiding any distortion or deformation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes


Q3: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement of achieving a clean, energetic, and minimalist aesthetic while retaining the bike and natural scene, examine if the edited image avoids unnecessary clutter, ensuring the focus remains on the bike while preserving the natural environment.
Question: Is the background clean and free from distracting elements, preserving the natural scene and focusing on the bike without introducing unnecessary elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the sub requirement of maintaining a natural appearance and the absence of obvious artifacts, verify if the lighting and shadows on the bike and the ground appear natural and consistent with the original scene.
Question: Do the lighting and shadows on the bike and the surrounding area look natural and consistent with the original environment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Considering the need to preserve structural coherence and visual plausibility while achieving a minimalist aesthetic, evaluate if the composition and layout of the bike within the frame contribute to the overall visual credibility.
Question: Is the bike positioned naturally within the frame, maintaining visual coherence and plausibility without appearing out of place?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
