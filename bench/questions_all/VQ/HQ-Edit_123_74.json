      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"cartoonizing the snowboarder by enlarging the helmet and hands for dynamism\", evaluate whether the proportion and physical rationality of the helmet have been altered in a way that maintains structural coherence. The original image shows a realistically sized helmet; enlarging it may affect visual credibility if the proportions become exaggerated or distorted. This question checks whether the helmet retains a plausible shape and size relative to the head and body, avoiding geometric distortion.",
      "question": "Is the helmet proportionally enlarged but still maintaining a coherent shape and realistic placement on the head without visible deformation or unnatural edges?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"enlarging the hands for dynamism\", assess whether the hand structure remains anatomically consistent. The original image shows natural hand positioning with five fingers and correct proportions. Enlarging the hands must not introduce extra fingers, incorrect joint angles, or unnatural textures. This question evaluates structural consistency and ergonomic plausibility.",
      "question": "Do the hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural joint alignment and no signs of distortion, stretching, or additional digits?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"enhancing colors with bold, contrasting red and deep blue tones\", determine whether the color enhancement affects the realism of materials such as the snowsuit and snow. The original image has balanced tones; over-saturation or mismatched hues could create unnatural textures or make fabrics appear plastic-like. This question checks if the red suit and surrounding environment maintain material authenticity despite color intensification.",
      "question": "Are the red tones on the snowsuit vivid but still consistent with fabric texture, without appearing overly glossy, pixelated, or disconnected from the underlying material?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"applying a paper-cut effect to the snow and trees for texture\", evaluate whether this stylistic change introduces artifacts such as jagged edges, inconsistent layering, or unnatural separation between elements. The original image features smooth snow and tree contours; adding a paper-cut style must preserve visual credibility by simulating layered cutouts without breaking geometric continuity.",
      "question": "Are the snow and tree outlines cleanly separated into layered shapes resembling paper cuts, without gaps, overlapping distortions, or floating fragments?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"including interchangeable action presets like different snowboard tricks\", assess whether the current pose (e.g., carving down a slope) is physically plausible given the snowboardâ€™s orientation and body posture. The original image shows a dynamic but stable stance. Any editing to suggest motion or trick variation must maintain balance and biomechanical logic. This question ensures the pose remains structurally coherent.",
      "question": "Is the snowboarder's body posture aligned with the direction of the snowboard, showing balanced weight distribution and no floating limbs or impossible angles?",
