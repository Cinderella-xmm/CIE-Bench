    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the bridge’s towers into wooden limbs with foliage, evaluate whether the new limb forms at the vertical support structures (originally metallic towers) exhibit natural branching patterns, bark texture consistency, and integration with surrounding trees. This includes checking for smooth transitions from metal to wood, absence of sharp edges, and realistic curvature.",
      "question": "Do the vertical towers now resemble tree limbs with natural bark texture and leaf coverage, without visible seams or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reshaping the bridge’s arches into a ribcage, assess whether the curved metal arches have been converted into a series of bone-like or woody ribs that follow anatomical spacing and curvature. Check for continuity, symmetry, and absence of jagged or broken edges.",
      "question": "Are the arches now formed into a continuous ribcage structure with natural curvature and spacing, free from broken or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing metal cables with vine-like tendrils, examine the suspension lines connecting the towers to the bridge deck. Evaluate whether they now appear as organic vines with natural curvature, texture variation, and realistic attachment points to the structure and surrounding vegetation.",
      "question": "Have the suspension cables been replaced with vine-like tendrils that show natural growth patterns, such as twisting or clinging, and do they blend with the forest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing stone bases with mossy roots, inspect the foundation of the bridge where it meets the stream. Evaluate whether the stone blocks have been replaced with roots that branch downward into the water, showing natural tapering, moss coverage, and integration with the riverbed.",
      "question": "Do the bridge’s foundations now consist of moss-covered roots extending into the stream, with natural branching and tapering, rather than solid stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a bark-textured head with glowing emerald eyes, locate the upper portion of the bridge (likely near the apex of one tower). Assess whether a head-like structure with bark texture and two glowing eyes has been added, with the glow appearing soft and localized, not overexposed or causing halo effects.",
      "question": "Is there a bark-textured head structure with two glowing emerald eyes positioned at the top of the bridge, with the glow confined and not causing light bleed or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
