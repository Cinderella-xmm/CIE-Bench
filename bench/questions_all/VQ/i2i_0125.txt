Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of ensuring that adding text does not affect the overall realism and natural appearance, verify if the addition of text introduces any unnatural textures or artifacts around the apples.
Question: Does the area around the apples show any unnatural textures or artifacts after adding the text "Fresh" at the bottom left and "Sweet" at the top right?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No  

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of maintaining the style, materials, and features reflecting overall reality and natural appearance, assess whether the fonts used for "Fresh" and "Sweet" blend seamlessly with the background image and do not appear out of place.
Question: Do the fonts for "Fresh" and "Sweet" appear visually consistent with the background image, avoiding any visual disruption or inconsistency?
Choices: Yes, No 
A: Yes 

Q3: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement of retaining core elements to ensure structural consistency and visual credibility, confirm if the placement of the added text preserves the integrity of the apples' shapes and does not distort their natural appearance.
Question: Are the shapes of the apples preserved without distortion after incorporating the text "Fresh" at the bottom left and "Sweet" at the top right?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: To ensure that proportions and physical rationality avoid distortion like broken shapes, examine if the alignment of the text with respect to the apples keeps their form intact.
Question: Is the alignment of the text "Fresh" at the bottom left and "Sweet" at the top right properly aligned so that it doesn't alter the apples' structure or visual balance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: In line with the sub requirement of avoiding introduction of artifacts like loss of details, verify that the fine details of the apples, such as speckles and lighting reflections, remain clear and undamaged after adding text.
