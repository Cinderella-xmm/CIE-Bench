      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying a brushstroke effect across the figure’s silhouette to create an artistic style, this question evaluates whether the texture modification maintains the overall form without distorting anatomical features such as limbs, joints, or facial structure. The brushstroke should enhance visual appeal without breaking continuity or causing visible artifacts like smearing or pixelation.",
      "question": "Does the brushstroke effect cover the figure evenly without disrupting the outline of limbs, head, or torso?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enlarging the hands to emphasize grip strength, this question checks whether the increased size of the hands adheres to anatomical plausibility and proportional balance with the rest of the body. The number of fingers must remain five, and the shape should reflect natural hand morphology under stress.",
      "question": "Are the enlarged hands anatomically accurate with five fingers each, and do they maintain natural joint alignment and skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of elongating the legs for dynamic proportions, this question assesses whether the extension of the legs preserves smooth curvature and continuous flow from hip to foot, avoiding sharp kinks or unnatural gaps that would suggest geometric distortion.",
      "question": "Do the elongated legs form a continuous, curved line from the hips to the feet without abrupt bends or discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using blue and silver gradients to accentuate form, this question evaluates whether the color transitions on the leotard and skin appear smooth and physically plausible, without harsh edges, color bleed, or loss of reflective qualities that define the original material.",
      "question": "Are the blue and silver gradients smoothly blended across the leotard and skin, without visible banding or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding swirling ribbons and stars as action motifs, this question verifies whether these elements are positioned in a way that suggests motion consistent with the gymnast’s pose, and whether they are properly integrated into the scene without overlapping the body or beam unnaturally.",
      "question": "Are the swirling ribbons and stars placed around the figure in a manner that follows the direction of movement and does not intersect with the body or balance beam?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of mounting the image on a matt-finish panel with rounded corners, this question checks whether the frame is consistently applied around the image, with no clipping of content, and whether the finish appears uniform and free of glare or shadow inconsistencies.",
      "question": "Is the matt-finish panel with rounded corners fully visible around the image, without cutting off any part of the gymnast or background?",
