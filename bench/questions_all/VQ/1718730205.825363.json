      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the cosmic vortex into a stained glass pattern with bold leadwork, this question evaluates whether the spiral structure retains its geometric integrity after the addition of lead outlines. The spiral is a central element with precise curvature and concentric layers. The presence of broken or misaligned lead lines would compromise structural consistency.",
      "question": "Are the leadwork outlines along the spiral vortex continuous, following the curve without gaps, overlaps, or abrupt breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying rich jewel tones to the sky and trees, this question assesses whether the color transformation results in natural-looking gradients and avoids harsh or unnatural transitions. The original image has soft pastel and starlit hues; shifting to jewel tones should not introduce visible banding or color bleeding.",
      "question": "Do the jewel-toned colors applied to the sky and tree canopies transition smoothly without visible color banding or unnatural patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding faceted glass textures to simulate light refraction, this question checks whether the texture appears physically plausible and does not degrade fine details. Faceted surfaces should reflect light realistically and maintain clarity, especially in high-detail areas like the spiral core and tree foliage.",
      "question": "Are the faceted glass textures applied uniformly across the spiral and trees, showing clear refraction effects without blurring or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of introducing bold leadwork outlines around all major elements, this question evaluates whether the outlines are consistently rendered and do not distort the underlying shapes. Lead lines should be sharp and separate glass panes logically, particularly at junctions between sky, trees, and horizon.",
      "question": "Do the leadwork lines form clean, unbroken borders around the spiral, trees, and horizon without intersecting incorrectly or creating floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving fine details such as stars, reflections, and leaf patterns, this question examines whether the stained glass effect obscures or corrupts small-scale features. For example, stars within the spiral should remain visible and distinct, and water reflections should not become distorted by texture overlays.",
      "question": "Are the individual stars within the spiral and the reflections on the water surface still distinguishable and not obscured by the glass texture or color saturation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
