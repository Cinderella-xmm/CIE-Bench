      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reimaging the sunflowers in the background with stylized geometric patterns and flowing organic lines, evaluate whether the transformed sunflowers retain structural coherence and avoid unnatural distortions. Specifically, check if the petals and centers maintain logical curvature and continuity without jagged edges or broken shapes.",
      "question": "Do the stylized sunflowers in the background have smooth, continuous curves without broken or fragmented petal edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the braided hairstyle into swirling Art Nouveau motifs, assess whether the hair structure remains physically plausible. Focus on the braid pattern and its transition into decorative swirlsâ€”check for any unnatural breaks, missing strands, or non-anatomical shapes.",
      "question": "Are the braids in the hair seamlessly transformed into flowing Art Nouveau swirls without visible gaps, stretched strands, or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the yellow dress into Art Nouveau-style swirling patterns, evaluate whether the fabric maintains realistic texture and draping. Check if the folds and flow of the dress follow natural physics and do not exhibit unnatural stretching or sharp angular distortions.",
      "question": "Does the dress display smooth, flowing patterns that follow the contours of the body without abrupt angles or unnatural fabric tension?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining stylistic consistency across the entire scene, verify that the Art Nouveau elements in the background, hair, and clothing harmonize without visual dissonance. Look for mismatches in line weight, color tone, or motif scale between the subject and environment.",
      "question": "Are the Art Nouveau patterns in the hair, dress, and background unified in line style, color palette, and scale, creating a cohesive visual composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving fine details during stylization, examine high-resolution areas such as the sunflower centers, individual petals, and hair strands. Ensure that these elements remain sharp and well-defined, without blurring, pixelation, or loss of edge clarity.",
      "question": "Are the fine details in the sunflower centers, hair braids, and facial features preserved and clearly defined, without noticeable blurring or artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
