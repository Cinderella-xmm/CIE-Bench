      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the butterfly’s wings into vibrant petal forms, evaluate whether the shape and structure of the wing-to-petal transformation maintain visual credibility and structural coherence. The original wings have a defined geometric pattern with veins and edges; replacing them with petal-like forms must preserve plausible geometry without introducing broken or distorted shapes.",
      "question": "Do the transformed wings retain smooth, continuous petal shapes that follow natural curvature and avoid jagged or fragmented edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing wing patterns with intricate leaf designs, assess whether the new textures on the wings appear natural and consistent with botanical structures. The original wing patterns are striped and symmetrical; substituting them with leaf motifs must avoid artificial-looking textures or mismatched scales.",
      "question": "Are the leaf designs on the wings detailed, evenly distributed, and free from unnatural pixelation or repeating patterns that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding tendrils growing from the antennae, determine if these appendages are proportionally accurate and structurally plausible. Tendrils should emerge naturally from the antennae and follow organic growth patterns without appearing rigid or disconnected.",
      "question": "Do the tendrils extending from the antennae curve smoothly and taper gradually, resembling natural plant growth rather than sharp, mechanical lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating small blossoms at the wing edges and foot, evaluate whether these floral elements are positioned plausibly and match the scale and texture of surrounding flora. The original meadow contains flowers of specific size and color; added blossoms must align in appearance and placement.",
      "question": "Are the small blossoms at the wing edges and foot similar in color, texture, and size to the surrounding flowers in the meadow, and do they attach seamlessly without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reshaping the butterfly’s body into a delicate flower stalk, assess whether the body maintains anatomical coherence with the new form. The original body is segmented and insect-like; converting it into a stalk must preserve vertical alignment and avoid unnatural bends or discontinuities.",
      "question": "Is the butterfly’s body transformed into a straight, slender stalk that connects naturally to the head and base, with no visible breaks or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
