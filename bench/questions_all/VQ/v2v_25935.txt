Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of converting the urban street scene into a stop-motion Lego diorama while maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility, we need to assess if the transition from real cobblestones to Lego bricks retains a natural appearance and avoids introducing unnatural textures.
Question: Do the Lego bricks representing the cobblestone path maintain a natural appearance without introducing obvious unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of recreating the buildings using Lego bricks, we need to evaluate if the transformation preserves the structural consistency and visual credibility of the buildings, avoiding distortions like broken geometric shapes.
Question: Are the Lego brick structures of the buildings coherent and visually credible, without any broken geometric shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: To ensure the man's figure remains authentic and natural within the Lego diorama, we must check if his proportions and physical rationality are preserved, avoiding distortions such as unnatural body shapes.
Question: Does the man's figure in the Lego diorama retain proper proportions and physical rationality, avoiding unnatural body shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement of maintaining the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the scene, we need to verify if the transition from real elements to Lego bricks does not introduce any loss of fine details or unnatural artifacts.
Question: Have the fine details of the man's clothing and accessories been preserved in the Lego diorama without introducing unnatural artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: To ensure the hand holding the briefcase appears natural and structurally consistent, we must confirm that the hand's shape, lines, and texture remain ergonomic and realistic within the Lego representation.
Question: Does the hand holding the briefcase in the Lego diorama appear natural with correct ergonomics, lines, and texture?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
