      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the building into a creature while retaining its spires and layered roof structures, this question evaluates whether the creature’s form maintains the original geometric integrity of the building. Specifically, it checks if the spires remain upright and structurally sound, and if the transitions from roof to limb or body are smooth and physically plausible, avoiding warped or collapsed forms.",
      "question": "Are the spires and roof layers of the creature aligned with the original building's structure, showing no signs of bending, breaking, or misalignment?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a custom orb at the creature’s feet with architectural motifs, this question assesses whether the orb’s design (pillars, arches) matches the material and style of the creature and surrounding environment. It checks for texture continuity, proportionality, and integration with the ground surface.",
      "question": "Does the orb at the creature’s feet feature pillars and arches that match the architectural style of the creature and have consistent texture and lighting?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of displaying an invented name near the creature, this question evaluates whether the text is clearly visible, properly scaled, and positioned without overlapping critical elements or causing visual imbalance. It also checks for readability and stylistic harmony with the fantasy theme.",
      "question": "Is the invented name displayed near the creature legible, properly sized, and positioned without overlapping the creature or water reflection?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of assigning a reflective elemental type (e.g., Mystic, Stone), this question checks whether the elemental label is present, readable, and stylistically consistent with the scene. It ensures the label does not appear as a random overlay but integrates naturally, possibly through subtle iconography or font choice.",
      "question": "Is the elemental type label (e.g., Mystic, Stone) visible near the creature and styled to match the overall fantasy aesthetic without appearing digitally pasted?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving fine details and smooth shading, this question evaluates whether the creature’s surface shows natural gradients, consistent lighting, and absence of artifacts such as jagged edges, smudges, or texture repetition. It focuses on the quality of rendering across the entire creature, especially at junctions between architectural and organic forms.",
      "question": "Does the creature’s surface display smooth shading and consistent texture across all architectural elements, with no visible pixelation, blurring, or unnatural color patches?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence and visual credibility, this question examines whether the creature’s limbs or body parts are proportionally balanced relative to the original building’s scale. It checks for physical plausibility, such as whether legs support the weight of the upper structure and whether joints are anatomically coherent.",

It checks for symmetry and clarity, ensuring the reflection enhances realism rather than introducing distortions.",
