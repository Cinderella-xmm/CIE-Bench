      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of altering the individual’s head-to-body ratio to create an oversized head and miniature body, this transformation affects the structural coherence and geometric rationality of the figure. The original person is positioned on the right side of the image, and any resizing must not introduce warped limbs, disconnected joints, or disproportionate torso-to-head ratios that violate human anatomy.",
      "question": "Does the character’s head appear significantly larger than the body while maintaining smooth contours and proper alignment of limbs and torso without visible stretching or tearing?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the original suit with a colorful, intricately patterned cartoon-style outfit, the new clothing must display consistent texture, color gradients, and fabric-like qualities appropriate to a stylized design. The original suit is black with a solid blue tie; the edit must avoid unnatural pixelation, repeated patterns, or abrupt color shifts.",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the character’s suit evenly distributed, free from repeating tiles or jagged edges, and do they follow a logical direction consistent with fabric draping?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding oversized glasses, these must be properly scaled and positioned on the face without overlapping facial features incorrectly or appearing transparent or clipped. The original face has defined eyes and nose; the glasses should integrate naturally.",
      "question": "Are the oversized glasses fully rendered with clear lenses and frames, aligned with the eye region, and without partial transparency or clipping against facial features?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the hand gesture to be playful and exaggerated, the hand must remain anatomically correct—no more than five fingers, natural joint angles, and consistent skin texture. The original hand is raised with palm facing forward; the edit must preserve finger count and ergonomics.",
      "question": "Does the hand have exactly five fingers, with natural curvature and spacing, and are there no distorted knuckles, extra digits, or unnatural shadowing?",

The original background includes neutral-toned flooring and blurred figures; the new environment must avoid mismatched lighting, floating objects, or inconsistent depth.",
      "question": "Are the abstract skyscrapers and balloons positioned at plausible distances, casting soft shadows, and aligned with the character’s perspective without floating above ground or appearing detached?",
