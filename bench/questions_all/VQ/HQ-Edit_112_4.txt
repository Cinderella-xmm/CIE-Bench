Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction involves transforming the Blue Jay into a whimsical miniature sculpture inside a glass dome terrarium. This requires replacing the natural bird with a stylized, sculpted version while maintaining its core visual identity (blue and white coloration). The transformation must preserve structural coherence—such as the shape of the bird’s body, wings, tail, and head—while introducing artificial materials like glass, wood, and crafted leaves. The addition of a glass dome, wooden perch, ivy, tiny leaves, and a tree stump introduces new elements that must integrate seamlessly without distorting proportions or introducing unnatural textures. The background remains consistent with green ivy, but the scene is now enclosed in a terrarium, which changes depth perception and lighting cues. Therefore, the sub-requirements focus on whether the edited elements maintain physical plausibility, material realism, geometric integrity, and compositional harmony.

-Sub requirement 1: The Blue Jay must be transformed into a miniature sculpture form, preserving its original shape and proportions while appearing made of non-natural materials (e.g., ceramic, metal, or resin), ensuring no distortion in anatomy such as elongated limbs or misshapen feathers.

-Sub requirement 2: A glass dome must be added around the bird, with transparent, smooth surfaces reflecting light realistically and showing no visible seams, cracks, or rendering artifacts; it should not obscure key features of the bird or introduce unnatural refractions.

-Sub requirement 3: The wooden perch must appear consistent with real wood texture, grain, and color, placed beneath the bird at a physically plausible angle and height to support the sculpture, avoiding floating or unstable positioning.

-Sub requirement 4: Ivy must wind upward along the structure, following natural growth patterns with realistic leaf shapes, spacing, and shadows, and must not overlap or intersect incorrectly with other elements like the glass dome or bird.

-Sub requirement 5: Tiny crafted leaves and a miniature tree stump must be added to the base, matching the scale of the bird sculpture and exhibiting appropriate detail, material texture (e.g., bark-like surface), and placement that supports garden-themed composition without cluttering or violating spatial logic.

-Sub requirement 6: The base must be moss-covered with earthy tones, featuring soft texture and subtle variation in color and density, blending naturally with surrounding elements and not appearing flat or digitally pasted.

-Sub requirement 7: The overall lighting must remain consistent with the original image’s warm sunlight from the top-right corner, casting soft shadows under the dome and on the perch, maintaining visual credibility and depth.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that the Blue Jay must be transformed into a miniature sculpture while preserving its anatomical structure and proportions, this question evaluates whether the bird’s body, wings, tail, and head retain their correct shape and size relative to each other, and whether the material appearance (e.g., glossy or matte finish) suggests a sculptural form without deformation or unnatural stretching.
Question: Does the bird’s body maintain accurate proportions and feather structure, with no distorted limbs, misplaced joints, or exaggerated features?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that a glass dome must be added around the bird with realistic transparency and reflections, this question checks for visual artifacts such as jagged edges, incorrect refraction, or missing reflections that would indicate poor rendering quality.
Question: Is the glass dome transparent with smooth surfaces, showing consistent reflections and refractions without visible seams, distortions, or pixelation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that the wooden perch must appear physically plausible and properly positioned, this question assesses whether the wood has natural grain patterns, appropriate thickness, and stable placement beneath the bird, avoiding floating or unsupported structures.
Question: Is the wooden perch textured with realistic grain and positioned securely under the bird, with no gaps or floating sections suggesting instability?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that ivy must grow naturally upward along the structure, this question evaluates whether the vines follow logical growth paths, have correctly shaped leaves, and do not intersect improperly with the glass dome or bird.
Question: Do the ivy vines curve naturally upward along the structure, with leaves spaced appropriately and no overlapping or clipping through the glass dome or bird?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that tiny crafted leaves and a miniature tree stump must be added at scale and with proper texture, this question checks if these elements match the size of the bird sculpture, exhibit detailed textures (like bark or leaf veins), and are placed logically within the scene.
Question: Are the crafted leaves and tree stump proportionally small compared to the bird, with visible texture details and positioned on the moss-covered base without appearing out of place or misaligned?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that the moss-covered base must have natural texture and color variation, this question evaluates whether the moss appears soft, layered, and integrated with the surrounding environment, without flat patches or artificial-looking borders.
Question: Does the moss-covered base show variation in color and texture, resembling real organic growth, with no sharp edges or uniformity suggesting digital pasting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q7: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that lighting must remain consistent with the original image, this question checks whether shadows fall correctly under the dome and perch, and whether highlights align with the sun position in the upper right, maintaining depth and realism.
Question: Are shadows cast by the bird, perch, and dome consistent with the light source in the upper right, with soft gradients and no mismatched highlights?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
