Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "adding a biomechanical horse robot in the same posture as the cow while maintaining the overall realism and natural appearance," evaluate if the overall structure and posture of the added biomechanical horse robot aligns well with the scene.
Question: Does the biomechanical horse robot maintain the same posture and appear structurally consistent with the cow's original position and stance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering "the maintained style and materials of the new horse feature a silver-white metallic shell, exposed joint mechanisms, and glowing red sensor eyes," assess the visual coherence of these new materials with the surrounding environment.
Question: Are the materials of the biomechanical horse robot, specifically the silver-white metallic shell and exposed joint mechanisms, seamlessly integrated into the rural setting without looking out of place?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Focusing on "avoiding artifacts such as unnatural textures and loss of details," verify the texture quality of the biomechanical horse robot and its impact on the scene's authenticity.
Question: Do the textures of the biomechanical horse robot, including the metallic shell and joints, appear natural and detailed without introducing any unnatural artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Given the instruction to "maintain structural consistency and visual credibility," ensure that the proportions and physical logic of the biomechanical horse robot are consistent and believable within the scene.
Question: Are the proportions and physical characteristics of the biomechanical horse robot, like its size relative to the road and grass, realistic and logically consistent?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Referring to the sub requirement of "ensuring the core elements retain visual plausibility," check if the biomechanical horse robot's addition disrupts the natural appearance and visual flow of the scene.
Question: Does the addition of the biomechanical horse robot preserve the visual plausibility of the scene, meaning does it not disrupt the natural appearance and flow of the road, grass, and trees?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
