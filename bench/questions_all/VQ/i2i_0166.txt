Q1:  
Thinking process: Given the editing instruction involves adding a literary-style short poem at the bottom of the image, we consider if this addition maintains the natural appearance and avoids introducing artifacts.

Question: Does the added poem text blend naturally with the image without causing any visible distortion to the background or bird?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q2:

Question: Does the poem text appear in a position that does not obscure important elements like the bird or branch, ensuring structural consistency?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The font and style of the added poem should be consistent with the natural and authentic appearance of the image. Evaluating the text's font, size, and clarity ensures it contributes positively to the image's aesthetic without disrupting its realism.  
Question: Is the font and size of the added poem text appropriate, maintaining readability while not overpowering the natural elements of the image?  
Choices: Yes, No

Question: Does the added poem text exhibit a smooth texture that aligns with the lighting and shadow of the original image, avoiding unnatural artifacts?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q5:
