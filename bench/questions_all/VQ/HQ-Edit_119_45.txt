Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction requires transforming the original Egyptian pharaoh mask into a Steampunk-inspired hieratic sculpture. This involves replacing traditional materials (gold, lapis lazuli, inlaid stones) with brass gears and polished copper while maintaining the overall headdress shape. The transformation must preserve structural coherence, especially in areas like the nemes headdress, facial features, and collar. The addition of mechanical wings with emerald accents and clockwork designs on the collar introduces new elements that must integrate seamlessly without distorting existing geometry or introducing unnatural textures. The presence of steam exhaust pipes and vapor implies dynamic effects that must appear plausible within the static image context. Therefore, key perceptual quality concerns include material consistency, geometric integrity, texture realism, and visual plausibility of added mechanical components.

-Sub requirement 1: Replace the traditional gold and lapis lazuli materials of the headdress and face with brass gears and polished copper, ensuring the new materials maintain consistent metallic sheen and reflectivity across all surfaces, particularly on the nemes headdress and facial structure, without introducing unnatural color gradients or texture discontinuities.

-Sub requirement 2: Maintain the original geometric shape of the nemes headdress while integrating brass gears and copper elements, ensuring no deformation or distortion in the striped pattern, especially along the vertical ridges and horizontal bands.

-Sub requirement 3: Add mechanical wings with emerald accents to the sides of the figure’s head or shoulders; evaluate whether these wings are proportionally scaled, structurally coherent, and integrated without disrupting the symmetry or balance of the composition.

-Sub requirement 4: Reimagine the broad collar with ornate clockwork designs, including small steam exhaust pipes; assess whether these additions follow logical mechanical layout, avoid overlapping or conflicting with existing structures, and exhibit realistic metal textures and fine detailing.

-Sub requirement 5: Introduce subtle wisps of vapor near the steam exhaust pipes; determine whether the vapor appears naturally diffused, translucent, and spatially consistent with the source pipe, avoiding artificial or pixelated edges.

-Sub requirement 6: Ensure all modifications preserve facial proportions and anatomical accuracy—especially around the eyes, nose, and mouth—despite material replacement, so that the face remains recognizable and structurally sound.

-Sub requirement 7: Verify that the transition between original and modified elements (e.g., from gold to brass, from stone to gear) is seamless, with no visible seams, misaligned edges, or abrupt changes in lighting or shadow.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing traditional materials with brass and polished copper across the headdress and face, this question evaluates whether the new metallic textures appear consistent and natural, particularly in high-detail areas like the stripes of the nemes headdress and facial surface. The goal is to ensure there are no unnatural reflections, inconsistent shading, or texture artifacts introduced during material substitution.
Question: Are the brass and copper textures on the headdress and face uniformly smooth and reflective, without visible noise, patchy areas, or abrupt transitions between adjacent segments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the original geometric shape of the nemes headdress while adding mechanical elements, this question checks for structural integrity and dimensional accuracy. The striped pattern must remain aligned and undistorted even after integration of gears and copper components.
Question: Do the vertical and horizontal stripes of the nemes headdress retain their original alignment and spacing, with no bending, stretching, or misalignment caused by the addition of mechanical parts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding mechanical wings with emerald accents, this question assesses whether the wings are physically plausible, properly positioned, and stylistically consistent with the rest of the sculpture. Their placement should not interfere with the head or shoulders, and their design should follow logical mechanical construction.
Question: Are the mechanical wings symmetrically placed on either side of the head or shoulders, with clean edges, defined joints, and emerald accents that do not appear floating or disconnected from the structure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of redesigning the collar with clockwork patterns and steam exhaust pipes, this question evaluates whether the added mechanical elements are logically arranged, visually cohesive, and free from clashing with existing features. The pipes must appear functional and integrated into the design.
Question: Are the clockwork designs on the collar clearly defined and evenly spaced, with steam exhaust pipes attached at plausible locations and angles, and no overlapping or clipping with surrounding elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding subtle vapor near the steam exhaust pipes, this question examines whether the vapor effect is rendered realistically, with soft edges and proper transparency, rather than appearing as artificial or blocky overlays.
Question: Is the vapor emerging from the steam exhaust pipes translucent and softly diffused, with no sharp edges, pixelation, or unnatural clustering that suggests digital artifacting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving facial proportions despite material change, this question ensures that the facial features—eyes, nose, lips—remain anatomically accurate and undistorted, even when covered in mechanical details or replaced with non-traditional materials.
Question: Are the eyes, nose, and mouth proportionally aligned and anatomically correct, with no warping, elongation, or asymmetry caused by the integration of gears or other mechanical elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
