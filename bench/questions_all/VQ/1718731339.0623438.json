      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of scaling down the armored figure to a miniature form without losing fine geometric details, this question evaluates whether the reduced size preserves the original texture fidelity, particularly in areas such as the helmet horns, shoulder spikes, and chest plate ridges. The presence of pixelation, blurring, or loss of surface detail would indicate a failure in perceptual quality.",
      "question": "Are all fine details such as spikes, rivets, and surface scratches on the armor clearly visible and undistorted after miniaturization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a transparent glass dome with realistic refractive properties, this question checks whether the dome appears seamless, free of rendering artifacts like jagged edges or incorrect light bending, and whether it correctly frames the figure without distorting its shape or causing double images.",
      "question": "Does the glass dome enclose the figure without visible seams, distortion, or unnatural refraction effects that alter the appearance of the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing rotating cogwheels at the base with proper alignment and integration, this question assesses whether the cogwheels are geometrically sound, properly meshed, and anchored to the base structure, avoiding floating or misaligned teeth that would break physical logic.",
      "question": "Are the cogwheels at the base fully connected to the foundation, with interlocking teeth and consistent size ratios, and no floating or disconnected parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of attaching mechanical wings that integrate with the shoulder armor, this question evaluates whether the wings are attached at logical joint points, follow the same material style, and do not introduce disproportionate or malformed segments that disrupt the figureâ€™s symmetry or mechanical credibility.",
      "question": "Are the mechanical wings securely connected to the shoulder armor, matching the metal texture and spike design, and free of unnatural bends or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding copper piping that follows logical routing and maintains material consistency, this question checks whether the pipes are placed along natural armor seams, have uniform thickness and curvature, and do not overlap or obscure important features like the chest plate or gauntlets.",
      "question": "Do the copper pipes follow continuous paths along armor joints, maintain consistent diameter and smooth bends, and avoid intersecting with key armor components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of suspending brass filigree orbs in orbit-like positions, this question evaluates whether the orbs are evenly spaced, non-overlapping with the figure or dome, and exhibit consistent metallic sheen and shadowing, indicating proper 3D placement and lighting.",
      "question": "Are the brass orbs positioned at varying distances around the figure, not touching or clipping into the armor or dome, and displaying uniform material finish and lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
