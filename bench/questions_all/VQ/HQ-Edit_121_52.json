      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"enlarging the astronaut's pose with action zig-zags\", this involves modifying the posture and motion lines of the astronaut. The original image shows a dynamic pose with one leg forward and arm raised, which must be exaggerated with stylized zig-zag motion lines. This transformation could affect structural coherence if the limbs are distorted or if the zig-zags break geometric continuity. The question evaluates whether the edited pose maintains natural limb proportions and joint alignment without unnatural bending or stretching.",
      "question": "Are the limbs of the astronaut proportionally consistent with human anatomy, and do they avoid unnatural bends or distortions in the joints when enlarged with zig-zag motion lines?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"stylizing the suit with celestial motifs in blues and silvers\", the original white spacesuit with red stripes and American flag patch will be modified with decorative patterns. This change affects material appearance and texture. The evaluation focuses on whether the new motifs integrate seamlessly into the suit fabric without introducing pixelation, mismatched shading, or inconsistent material properties (e.g., metallic sheen vs. fabric texture).",
      "question": "Do the celestial motifs applied to the suit exhibit uniform texture and shading that aligns with the material appearance of the spacesuit, without visible seams or artifacts?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding an illustrated moon surface beneath\", the original lunar terrain is realistic with craters and dust. Replacing it with an illustrated version may introduce inconsistencies in depth, lighting, or texture. The evaluation checks whether the illustrated surface matches the perspective and scale of the astronaut’s shadow and foot placement, ensuring visual credibility and avoiding floating or misaligned elements.",
      "question": "Is the illustrated moon surface positioned at the correct depth and scale relative to the astronaut’s feet and shadow, with no visible gaps or misalignment between the figure and ground?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"transforming the astronaut into a cartoon-style character\", this includes altering facial features, proportions, and textures toward stylization. The original face has detailed skin tone and hair, which may become oversimplified or exaggerated. The evaluation checks whether the facial structure retains anatomical plausibility (e.g., eye spacing, nose shape) and avoids unnatural smoothing or warping that breaks realism.",
      "question": "Does the astronaut’s face retain natural facial proportions and feature alignment, such as symmetrical eyes and a defined jawline, without excessive smoothing or distortion?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"printing on textured white card stock with space-themed border for collectible appeal\", this involves adding a border and simulating paper texture. The evaluation focuses on whether the border integrates naturally around the image without clipping or overlapping the astronaut, and whether the simulated texture appears consistent across the entire frame without visible digital artifacts like repeating patterns or color banding.",
      "question": "Is the space-themed border evenly aligned around the image edge without overlapping or cutting into the astronaut or background elements, and does the simulated card stock texture appear uniform and free of repetition?",
