      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding facial features (eyes, mouth) to the feather-shaped earrings, evaluate whether the facial elements are proportionally sized and positioned within the bounds of the feather structure without distorting its original shape or disrupting the engraved line patterns. The eyes and mouth must appear as part of the metal surface, not floating above it, and their texture should match the surrounding metallic finish.",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) on the feather earrings proportionally sized and seamlessly integrated into the feather surface without distorting the engraved lines or creating unnatural texture contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the earrings into anthropomorphic characters, assess whether the added faces maintain the structural consistency of the original feather design. The central oval black stone should remain intact and not be obscured or altered by facial features, and the symmetry of the feather pattern should not be broken.",
      "question": "Is the central black oval stone on each feather preserved and unobscured by the added facial features, and do the engraved lines of the feather remain symmetrical and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of depicting one earring pulling the other along a breezy path, evaluate whether the spatial relationship between the two earrings suggests motion without violating physical logic. The pulling earring should have an extended arm-like extension or connection to the other, and both should remain attached to their respective hooks. There should be no floating or detached components.",
      "question": "Is there a visible and logically connected arm-like extension from one earring to the other, suggesting motion, and are both earrings still properly attached to their hooks without floating or detachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a text bubble with the phrase “Let's soar to new heights today!”, evaluate whether the text bubble is placed near the character’s head, uses a clear and readable font consistent with comic style, and does not overlap or obscure key parts of the earrings or background elements.",
      "question": "Is the text bubble positioned near the head of the anthropomorphic earring, clearly legible, and free from overlapping or covering essential details of the earrings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying bold outlines and vibrant colors while blending realism with cartoonish flair, evaluate whether the color transitions between the metallic silver and added vibrant hues are smooth and consistent, and whether the bold outlines follow the contours of the earrings without jagged edges or misalignment. The texture of the metal should remain visible beneath the stylized coloring.",
      "question": "Do the bold outlines follow the exact contours of the earrings without gaps or misalignment, and are the vibrant colors applied consistently without pixelation, blurring, or loss of fine engraved details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
