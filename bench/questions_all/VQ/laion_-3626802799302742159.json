      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding expressive faces and limbs to the cookies, which involves modifying their original circular shape and texture, evaluate whether the added facial features (eyes, mouth) and limbs maintain a natural appearance without introducing unnatural textures or distortions. The editing targets are the cookies both inside the cup and on the plate. The addition of facial features must not break the geometric integrity of the cookies or create artificial-looking textures.",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) and limbs added to the cookies smooth, proportionally consistent with the cookie size, and free from pixelation or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the pink plate into a floral-patterned picnic blanket, evaluate whether the material transformation maintains visual coherence and realism. The original plate is flat and speckled ceramic; changing it to a fabric-like blanket requires altering texture, pattern, and edge behavior. The question checks if the new pattern appears seamlessly integrated and physically plausible as a blanket.",
      "question": "Does the floral pattern on the transformed plate appear continuous, evenly distributed, and consistent with fabric texture, without visible seams or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of making the cup appear as a clubhouse for the cookie characters, evaluate whether the cup’s structure remains intact and physically credible when modified to include props like tiny chairs and a tea table. The cup's handle, rim, and interior should not be distorted or broken by the addition of furniture. Structural consistency and spatial logic are key.",
      "question": "Are the added miniature chairs and tea table positioned within the cup and around it in a way that respects physical proportions and does not cause overlapping or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of assigning unique emotions (grinning, pouting, winking) to individual cookies, evaluate whether each facial expression is distinct, anatomically plausible, and consistent with the cookie’s round shape. The eyes and mouth must follow typical facial expression rules without deformation or unrealistic spacing.",
      "question": "Do the facial expressions on the cookies (grinning, pouting, winking) show clear differentiation in mouth and eye shapes while maintaining symmetry and natural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of creating a cohesive narrative scene with a tea party theme, evaluate whether the overall composition—especially the placement of cookies, cup, and props—creates a believable spatial arrangement. The interaction between objects (e.g., cookies entering the cup, chairs near the cup) must follow logical spatial relationships and avoid floating or misaligned elements.",
      "question": "Are the positions of the cookie characters, chairs, and tea table arranged in a way that suggests stable contact with surfaces and realistic depth, without floating or misplaced objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
