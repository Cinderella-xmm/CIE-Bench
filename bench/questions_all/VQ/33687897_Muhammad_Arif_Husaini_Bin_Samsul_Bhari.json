      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the mountain into a colossal mythical creature with a stone-like texture, evaluate whether the material and surface texture of the mountain’s body (originally a smooth volcanic peak) now appear consistent with carved stone, avoiding unnatural textures such as pixelation, repetitive patterns, or inconsistent roughness. The editing involves replacing natural rock with a stylized, mythical form, so it is essential to check if the new texture maintains visual coherence with the surrounding environment.",
      "question": "Does the stone-like texture applied to the mountain's surface exhibit uniformity and natural variation in roughness, without visible artifacts like repeating patterns or abrupt transitions?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of crafting rock-carved eyes at the peak of the mountain (which is currently a smooth summit), assess whether the newly added eyes maintain structural plausibility—such as correct depth, shape, and alignment—with the mountain's geometry. The eyes must not distort the original mountain silhouette or appear floating or misaligned relative to the peak.",
      "question": "Are the rock-carved eyes positioned symmetrically and proportionally on the mountain’s peak, with realistic depth and integration into the terrain, avoiding floating or misplaced features?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of extending ridges as sprawling wings and roots as limbs, evaluate whether these extended structures maintain geometric continuity with the original mountain contours and appear physically plausible. The wings should emerge naturally from the slopes, and the limbs should integrate with the silhouetted trees without breaking their forms or creating unnatural angles.",
      "question": "Do the wing-like ridges extend from the mountain’s sides in a way that follows natural geological lines and does not introduce sharp, broken, or impossible angles?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of intertwining roots as limbs with the silhouetted trees in the foreground, assess whether the interaction between the mythical creature’s limbs and the tree branches appears seamless. The fusion should not result in overlapping inconsistencies, clipping errors, or unnatural merging where limbs pass through solid tree trunks.",
      "question": "Are the limbs of the creature integrated with the tree silhouettes in a way that avoids visual conflicts such as overlapping branches appearing behind solid limbs or disconnected joints?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding luminous veins across the creature’s body reflecting sky hues, evaluate whether these veins are rendered with soft gradients and consistent light emission, matching the ambient lighting of the scene. They should not appear as harsh, glowing lines or disrupt the foggy atmosphere with unnatural brightness.",
      "question": "Do the luminous veins emit a soft glow that blends with the blue and pink hues of the sky, without creating bright halos, sharp edges, or overexposed areas?",
