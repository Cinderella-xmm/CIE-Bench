      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a secret watch communicator to the plaid tie on the left, this involves modifying the tie's surface to include a mechanical device. The question evaluates whether the added gadget maintains realistic proportions, material consistency (e.g., metallic sheen, reflections), and seamless integration with the plaid pattern without creating visible seams, texture breaks, or unnatural lighting.",
      "question": "Is the watch communicator on the plaid tie positioned naturally within the fabric, with consistent color, texture, and lighting that match the surrounding material?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of embedding a hidden camera lens into the emblem on the right suit’s lapel, this involves altering a small but detailed area. The question checks if the lens appears as a plausible extension of the emblem’s design, with proper depth, reflection, and integration into the fabric’s surface, avoiding floating or disconnected elements.",
      "question": "Is the camera lens embedded in the emblem on the right suit’s lapel aligned with the pattern and fabric, showing no gaps, misaligned edges, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding thought bubbles and dialogue text, this involves placing new graphical elements near the characters' heads. The question assesses whether the text and bubbles are correctly sized, positioned, and styled without overlapping or distorting facial features or clothing, and whether the font is crisp and legible.",
      "question": "Are the thought bubbles and dialogue text clearly separated from the characters’ faces and clothing, with clean lines and no overlap or distortion of nearby features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of anthropomorphizing the suits as agents, this involves stylizing the characters while preserving their core structure. The question evaluates whether the transformation maintains anatomical correctness, especially around the neck and shoulders, and avoids exaggerated or broken shapes that would compromise visual credibility.",
      "question": "Do the characters’ necks and shoulders retain natural proportions and smooth contours, without stretched, compressed, or fragmented shapes after anthropomorphization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the lush field backdrop, this involves ensuring the background remains intact and visually coherent during the comic conversion. The question checks for any artifacts such as pixelation, blurring, or unnatural color shifts in the grass and sky areas.",
      "question": "Is the grassy field and sky background free from distortion, noise, or color inconsistencies that suggest digital manipulation or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
