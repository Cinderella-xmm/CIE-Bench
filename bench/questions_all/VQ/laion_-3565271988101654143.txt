Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the smartphone display into an interactive sci-fi mission control interface while retaining core blue accents, evaluate whether the new interface elements (such as holographic widgets and 3D floating components) maintain visual coherence with the original phone’s design. Specifically, assess if the added elements appear integrated rather than pasted or disjointed, and whether their shapes and lighting are consistent with the physical constraints of a mobile screen.
Question: Do the holographic widgets and 3D elements on the smartphone screen appear seamlessly integrated with the device's surface, maintaining consistent depth cues and shadowing that match the phone's form factor?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement to simulate the screen projecting forward, assess whether the projection effect creates a plausible illusion of depth without distorting the surrounding elements. This includes checking for unnatural warping, inconsistent perspective, or misalignment between the projected content and the phone’s edges.
Question: Is the forward-projection effect of the smartphone screen visually coherent, with no distortion of the phone’s frame or screen edges, and does it maintain proper spatial relationship with the hand holding it?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement to integrate a detailed hand scanning overlay for biometric access, evaluate whether the overlay appears as a translucent, layered graphic that conforms to the contours of the hand without disrupting anatomical structure or texture. Check for unnatural textures, incorrect finger count, or misplaced scan lines.
Question: Does the biometric hand scanning overlay align precisely with the hand’s natural anatomy, showing accurate finger positions and skin texture, without introducing extra fingers or distorted proportions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement to convert the laptop display to a panoramic view of a futuristic skyline with pixel-perfect graphics, evaluate whether the new image maintains geometric accuracy and visual continuity with the original layout. Assess if the transition from financial charts to a cityscape is seamless and physically plausible, avoiding abrupt edges or mismatched scale.
Question: Is the futuristic skyline displayed on the laptop screen rendered with consistent geometry and perspective, and does it align naturally with the laptop’s bezel and keyboard without clipping or misalignment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement to ensure narrative continuity between the phone and laptop interface designs, evaluate whether both screens share a unified aesthetic—such as color scheme, font style, and technological theme—while maintaining individual functionality. Check for visual harmony in blue accents and futuristic motifs across both devices.
Question: Do the smartphone and laptop displays share consistent visual design elements (e.g., blue color palette, futuristic typography, and interface style) that create a cohesive technological narrative without conflicting styles?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
