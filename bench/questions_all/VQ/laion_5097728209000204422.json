      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the current shirt with Renaissance-style garments made of velvet and brocade, this question evaluates whether the new clothing material appears natural in texture and shading. The original shirt has a smooth, matte surface with subtle stitching. The edited version should show rich, layered textures typical of velvet and brocade, with proper reflection and shadowing consistent with the light source. Any flatness, repeating patterns, or artificial sheen would indicate poor quality.",
      "question": "Does the velvet and brocade material on the garment display realistic fabric texture with appropriate highlights and shadows, and no repeating or pixelated patterns?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a ruffled collar and gold embroidery, this question focuses on the structural integrity and visual plausibility of these additions. The ruffle must follow natural folds around the neck, and the embroidery must be detailed but not overly sharp or disconnected from the fabric. Misalignment, floating edges, or inconsistent line thickness could suggest artifacts.",
      "question": "Is the ruffled collar properly attached to the neckline, showing natural fold patterns, and does the gold embroidery follow continuous, coherent lines without broken or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the pose to place one hand on a decorative sword hilt, this question checks for anatomical correctness and physical plausibility. The hand must have five fingers, correctly positioned around the hilt, with natural curvature and skin texture. The sword should be proportionally sized and aligned with the hand’s grip, avoiding floating or clipping issues.",
      "question": "Does the hand gripping the sword hilt have exactly five fingers with natural joint bends and skin texture, and is the sword hilt positioned realistically within the grasp without clipping or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the background to a classical study with books and drapery, this question assesses integration between the subject and the new environment. The lighting should match the subject’s illumination, and the depth should create a believable space. Visible seams, mismatched shadows, or unrealistic object placement would compromise authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the background composed of books and drapery in muted earth tones, seamlessly blended with the subject, showing consistent lighting and depth without visible edges or unnatural spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining overall visual coherence across all elements, this question evaluates whether the edited image avoids distortions such as warped features, misaligned limbs, or inconsistent proportions. The face, hands, clothing, and background should all align in scale and perspective, preserving the original person’s identity while adapting to the new style.",
      "question": "Are all elements—the face, clothing, hand position, sword, and background—proportionally aligned and structurally consistent, with no stretched, duplicated, or missing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
