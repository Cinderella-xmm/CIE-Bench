      "thinking_process": "Considering the sub requirement of converting the character into a plastic figurine while retaining the current standing pose, we need to evaluate if the figurine maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility without introducing distortions such as unnatural textures, broken geometric shapes, or degraded fine details.",
      "question": "Does the plastic figurine maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the character's body, avoiding distortion or broken geometric shapes?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Given the sub requirement of displaying the plastic figurine on a desk with added lighting effects around it, we need to examine if the lighting effects are integrated naturally with the figurine and the environment, ensuring authenticity and natural appearance.",
      "question": "Are the added lighting effects around the plastic figurine seamlessly integrated with its surface and the surrounding desk, avoiding unnatural highlights or shadows?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Focusing on the sub requirement of maintaining the current standing pose during the transformation into a plastic figurine, we should assess if the figurine retains the structural consistency and visual credibility of the character's pose, especially concerning the hands and hammer.",
      "question": "Do the hands of the plastic figurine holding the hammer retain natural textures and shapes, with no more than five fingers and no signs of ergonomic distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Analyzing the sub requirement of maintaining the current standing pose, itâ€™s crucial to ensure that the transition from a human form to a plastic figurine retains the core element's structural consistency and visual credibility, especially regarding the character's facial area.",
      "question": "Has the plastic figurine retained a structurally sound head and face consistent with the character's identity, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "To meet the sub requirement of designing a plastic figurine from the character while keeping the standing pose, we must evaluate whether the figurine maintains a coherent design style and materials that reflect the overall sense of reality and natural appearance, particularly focusing on the armor and cape.",
      "question": "Do the armor and cape of the plastic figurine appear cohesive with the rest of the figurine, avoiding any unnatural textures or materials that disrupt the visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
