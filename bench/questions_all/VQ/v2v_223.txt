Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility, evaluate whether the transition from the Victorian dress to a 3D cartoon style maintains the natural appearance and avoids introducing unnatural textures or loss of details.
Question: Does the lacework on the dress retain its intricate details without appearing distorted or overly simplified in the 3D cartoon style?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the need to avoid artifacts and maintain authenticity, assess if the soft lighting used in the 3D rendering complements the refined yet colorful personality while preserving the texture and patterns of the original attire.
Question: Is the soft lighting applied evenly across the character card, ensuring that the dress's floral patterns and lace details are clearly visible without any harsh shadows or highlights?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: To ensure the overall realism and natural appearance, check if the addition of skill bars or attributes such as [Skill1 +x] and [Skill2 +x] integrates seamlessly with the design without disrupting the visual flow or introducing distracting elements.
Question: Are the skill bars and attributes like [Grace +10] and [Etiquette +8] placed in a way that they do not overlap with the character's dress or other important visual elements, maintaining the card's clean layout?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the avoidance of distortion and maintaining physical rationality, verify if the title banner at the top and name tag at the bottom of the card align well with the Victorian theme and do not introduce any geometric inconsistencies.
Question: Do the title banner and name tag have consistent fonts and styles that match the Victorian era, and are their shapes and sizes proportionate to the rest of the card?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Evaluating the absence of obvious artifacts and ensuring structural consistency, determine if the background featuring warm tones and complementary designs enhances the overall composition without conflicting with the main subject.
Question: Does the background with warm tones and complementary designs enhance the Victorian lady's presence on the card without overpowering her figure or causing any visual clutter?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
