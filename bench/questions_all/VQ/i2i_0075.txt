Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of maintaining the catâ€™s overall realism and natural appearance while adding a right-side view, we should assess if the fur texture remains authentic and undistorted.
Question: Does the fur texture on the side of the cat appear smooth and consistent with the texture on the front part without any unnatural artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: To evaluate if the combined image retains the core element's structural consistency and visual credibility, we examine the alignment between facial features and body proportions.
Question: Are the cat's front and side views proportionally aligned without any noticeable distortion or overlapping artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Given the need to avoid introducing unnatural textures or loss of details, especially around the cat's eyes and ears, it's essential to check for any anomalies.
Question: Do the cat's eyes and ears retain their natural shape and detail, free from any visible artifacts or blurring?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The authenticity of the final image relies on the seamless integration of the front and side views without creating any visually implausible angles or gaps.
Question: Is there a continuous and natural transition where the front and side views of the cat meet, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or awkward intersections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Since the original image shows the cat in a relaxed pose, the edited image should maintain this natural posture and avoid any physical inconsistencies.
Question: Does the overall posture and positioning of the cat in the combined image remain plausible and natural, without introducing any unnatural bending or stretching of limbs?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
