    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enclosing the entire scene within a crystal-clear snow globe, evaluate whether the spherical boundary is visually present and correctly renders the curvature and transparency of glass. The question checks for artifacts such as jagged edges, incorrect refraction, or abrupt transitions between the globe and background.",
      "question": "Is the edge of the snow globe smooth and continuous, with no visible seams, distortions, or pixelation along its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining realistic material properties for the snow globe, assess whether light interacts naturally with the transparent sphere—specifically, whether reflections and refractions are consistent with glass optics. This includes checking for accurate highlights, internal shadows, and distortion of the background through the globe.",
      "question": "Are the reflections and refractions on the snow globe surface consistent with how light behaves on clear glass, showing subtle bending of the scene behind it and soft highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving the proportions and anatomy of the tiny figures walking the Wall, verify that each figure has a full set of limbs, correct body shape, and no clipping or stretching due to scaling. Focus on the group of people near the center of the Wall and those descending the stairs.",
      "question": "Do all visible figures inside the snow globe have complete and correctly proportioned limbs, with no extra fingers, missing arms, or distorted postures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding bright autumn foliage without disrupting existing textures, examine the trees and shrubs along the mountain slopes. The new colors should enhance the scene without creating sharp color boundaries or unnatural patches.",
      "question": "Are the autumn-colored leaves integrated smoothly into the existing green vegetation, with no abrupt color changes or blocky textures indicating digital overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of introducing a swirling snow effect, evaluate whether the snow particles are evenly distributed and move in a coherent flow pattern. Check if they obscure important elements or appear as static, flat layers.",
      "question": "Are the snow particles visible throughout the globe in a dynamic, swirling pattern, and do they not fully cover the Great Wall or figures, allowing them to remain clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of including ceramic birds in flight, assess whether the birds are small, detailed, and positioned in mid-air trajectories that suggest motion. Check for unnatural shapes or floating objects that break physical logic.",
      "question": "Are the ceramic birds clearly distinguishable as small flying objects with defined wings and bodies, and are they located in the air above the Wall without touching any surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a dark wooden base with engraved text, evaluate whether the base appears solid and grounded under the snow globe, with visible wood grain and readable lettering. Confirm that the text “Great Wall Memories” is correctly spelled and proportionally sized.",
      "question": "Is the wooden base dark in color, textured with realistic grain, and does it support the snow globe without floating or tilting, with the engraved text clearly legible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
