Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the drone’s central body into a robotic face while retaining sharp edges for a futuristic appearance. This involves modifying the central fuselage of the original black quadcopter (601S/Black), which is currently a flat, angular structure with gold accents and text. The transformation must preserve geometric coherence and material consistency (e.g., metallic sheen) to maintain visual credibility. Any distortion in shape or texture could break structural realism.
-Sub requirement 1: Modify the central body of the drone into a robotic face, ensuring that the sharp edges are preserved and the new facial features (eyes, mouth, etc.) align with the original angular design without introducing unnatural textures or broken geometry.

-<Thinking Process 2>: The rotor blades are to be converted into rotating arms for propulsion. In the original image, the four propellers are symmetrically mounted on arms extending from the central body. These are simple two-blade black rotors. Converting them into articulated arms requires maintaining proportional length and mechanical plausibility, avoiding unrealistic joint placements or deformation of the blade shapes.
-Sub requirement 2: Convert each rotor blade into an arm-like structure capable of rotation; ensure the arms retain proportionality to the drone's size and do not exhibit unnatural bending, stretching, or missing segments.

-<Thinking Process 3>: The landing gears are to be integrated as spider-like legs. In the original image, the landing gear consists of four thin, curved black supports at the ends of each arm. These will now function as legs, implying articulation and jointed movement. The transformation must preserve the original material appearance (black matte metal) and avoid misalignment or floating joints.
-Sub requirement 3: Replace the existing landing gear with spider-like legs that extend from the same positions; verify that leg joints are structurally coherent and do not appear detached or distorted.

-<Thinking Process 4>: The character must be placed mid-flight over a futuristic cityscape with a sleek metallic aura. This involves adding a background scene not present in the original image. The lighting and reflection on the drone should match the environment—specifically, metallic highlights and ambient glow consistent with sci-fi urban lighting.
-Sub requirement 4: Add a futuristic cityscape background and apply metallic aura effects to the drone; assess whether the lighting, shadows, and reflections are consistent with the new environment and do not introduce mismatched glows or harsh transitions.

-<Thinking Process 5>: A speech bubble with the text “Secure the Quantum Core!” must be added in bold, tech-style font. The placement must be near the drone’s head (formerly the central body), and the font style must match the sci-fi theme without overlapping or obscuring key elements.
-Sub requirement 5: Insert a speech bubble with specified text and font near the robotic face; evaluate whether the text is legible, stylistically consistent, and does not distort surrounding elements.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of modifying the central body into a robotic face while preserving sharp edges, this question evaluates whether the facial features (such as eyes, mouth, or sensors) are seamlessly integrated into the original angular structure without distorting its geometry or introducing unnatural textures like pixelation or smudging.
Question: Are the facial features on the central body aligned with the original angular design and free from visible texture artifacts or shape distortions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting rotor blades into arms, this question checks if the transformed arms maintain proportional length and mechanical integrity relative to the drone's body, and whether they appear to rotate naturally without unnatural bends or disconnected joints.
Question: Do the arms formed from rotor blades have consistent proportions and smooth joints that suggest functional rotation without visible warping or breakage?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing landing gears with spider-like legs, this question evaluates whether the new legs are attached at the correct positions (ends of arms) and exhibit proper joint structure and material continuity, avoiding floating or misaligned limbs.
Question: Are the spider-like legs connected at the original landing gear locations and do they display coherent joint structures without gaps or floating segments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the character mid-flight over a futuristic cityscape with a metallic aura, this question assesses whether the lighting and reflective properties on the drone match the environmental lighting (e.g., ambient glow, specular highlights) and whether the background integration is seamless without abrupt edges or color mismatches.
Question: Is the lighting on the drone consistent with the futuristic cityscape background, showing appropriate metallic reflections and no harsh transitions between the drone and environment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a speech bubble with bold tech-style text, this question checks if the text is clearly readable, stylistically matched to the sci-fi theme, and positioned without overlapping critical parts of the drone or causing visual clutter.
Question: Is the speech bubble positioned near the robotic face with clear, legible text and no overlap with drone components or background elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
