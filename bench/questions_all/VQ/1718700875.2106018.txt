Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "designing an intricately detailed 3D figurine inspired by Marie Antoinette's attire," the original image features a poodle dressed in an ornate, pastel-colored gown with ruffles and lace. The editing instruction requires transforming this into a 3D figurine with a lace-textured finish, preserving the elaborate dress and accessories. This transformation involves material and structural changes, so it is essential to assess whether the texture applied to the figurine maintains visual coherence with the original clothing’s fine details and avoids unnatural rendering artifacts such as jagged edges or inconsistent surface patterns.
Question: Does the lace-textured finish on the figurine preserve the fine details of the original dress, such as the ruffles and embroidery, without introducing pixelation or unnatural texture repetition?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: The instruction specifies mounting the figurine on a polished wooden base with gilded scrollwork. This addition introduces new geometric elements (the base and its decorative features) that must align physically and visually with the figurine. The base must appear proportionally correct relative to the figurine and exhibit realistic wood grain and metallic sheen without distortion or misalignment.
Question: Is the wooden base proportionally consistent with the figurine, showing natural wood grain and gilded scrollwork without warped geometry or mismatched lighting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: The editing instruction calls for placing the figurine within a baroque-style display case adorned with floral motifs, echoing the rococo backdrop. This involves adding a complex architectural element around the figurine. The display case must maintain structural integrity—its glass panels, frame, and floral decorations should not exhibit broken lines, floating elements, or incorrect perspective. The integration with the background must also be seamless.
Question: Are the edges and corners of the display case sharp and continuous, with no floating fragments or incorrectly rendered shadows, and do the floral motifs follow a coherent design pattern?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The original image shows a poodle with highly stylized fur and a delicate facial structure. Transforming this into a 3D figurine requires maintaining the anatomical accuracy of the dog’s head and body while converting it into a rigid, sculptural form. Any deformation in the proportions—such as elongated limbs or flattened features—would compromise visual credibility.
Question: Does the figurine retain the correct proportions of the poodle’s head and body, with no unnatural stretching, compression, or misalignment of facial features?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The instruction emphasizes the use of pastel colors and ornate accessories from the original image. These elements must be preserved in the figurine version, including the pink ruffles and silver embellishments. The color balance and material reflectivity must remain consistent with the original aesthetic, avoiding color shifts or loss of detail in reflective surfaces like beads or metallic accents.
Question: Are the pastel colors of the dress and the reflective qualities of the silver embellishments accurately maintained, with no color bleeding or loss of fine detail in the textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
