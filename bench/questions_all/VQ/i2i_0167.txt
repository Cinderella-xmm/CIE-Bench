Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the natural appearance and authenticity of the apple's surface texture while displaying the front view, judge if the texture details remain consistent and undistorted after editing.
Question: Does the front view of the apple maintain its original texture and color without any noticeable artifacts or unnatural smoothing?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Considering the need for the cross-section to show the natural texture of the apple's flesh, check if the generated texture matches the expected appearance of a real apple's interior and whether it integrates seamlessly with the outer skin.
Question: Does the cross-section reveal a natural, detailed texture of the apple's flesh, avoiding any unnatural or overly smooth appearance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Focusing on the top view depiction of the apple’s stem and calyx, assess whether these elements are structurally coherent, proportional, and visually credible without introducing distortions or unrealistic shapes.
Question: Is the top view of the apple’s stem and calyx accurately represented with natural proportions and geometry, without any obvious distortions or artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Evaluating the consistency between the three views (front, cross-section, top), ensure that the overall structure of the apple remains cohesive and logical, avoiding inconsistencies in size, shape, or texture across different angles.
Question: Are the shapes, sizes, and textures of the apple consistent across the front view, cross-section, and top view, ensuring structural coherence without any contradictions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Assessing the overall integration of new elements (cross-section and top view) into the image, ensure that lighting and shadows are applied naturally, enhancing visual credibility and avoiding anomalies like inconsistent light sources or misplaced shadows.
Question: Do the lighting and shadows in the cross-section and top view appear natural and consistent with those in the front view, contributing to a unified appearance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
