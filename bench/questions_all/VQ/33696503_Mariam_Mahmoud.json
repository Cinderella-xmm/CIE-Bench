      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the orange lifebuoy into an eye with seafoam lashes, this evaluates whether the circular shape of the lifebuoy remains intact and serves as a plausible eye, with surrounding foam resembling eyelashes. The focus is on shape preservation and natural integration of foam elements.",
      "question": "Is the orange lifebuoy still clearly visible as a circular object centered within the intended eye area, with white foamy textures extending outward like lashes without breaking the circle's outline?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the netting into delicate fins, this assesses whether the mesh pattern has been smoothly transformed into flowing, fin-like structures without retaining rigid or unnatural grid lines. Attention is given to texture continuity and edge smoothness.",
      "question": "Are the netting sections along the shoreline transformed into soft, undulating fin shapes with gradual transitions from mesh to organic form, lacking sharp angles or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reshaping the shoreline into a curved body with wave patterns, this checks whether the sand-to-body transition follows a natural curve, maintaining consistent thickness and avoiding abrupt changes in elevation or texture.",
      "question": "Does the shoreline curve smoothly into a continuous, rounded body shape with wave-like ridges embedded in the sand, without sudden kinks or flat regions disrupting the flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding faint sea-green bioluminescent markings, this evaluates whether these markings appear softly blended into the sand surface, with subtle gradients and no hard outlines or digital artifacts such as halos or noise.",
      "question": "Are the sea-green markings distributed evenly across the sandy surface with soft, diffused edges and no visible pixels, overlays, or repeating patterns that suggest artificial addition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining overall structural coherence, this examines whether all transformed elements—the eye, fins, body, and markings—are spatially aligned and proportionally balanced, forming a unified creature rather than a collection of unrelated parts.",
      "question": "Do the eye (lifebuoy), fins (netting), and body (shoreline) align in a way that suggests a single, cohesive organism with logical proportions and no floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
