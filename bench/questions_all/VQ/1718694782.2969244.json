      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding motion lines around the character in Panel 1 to emphasize movement, this involves introducing new visual elements near the character's limbs and body. The motion lines must follow the direction of motion and maintain consistent thickness and spacing without intersecting or overlapping unnaturally with the character’s form. This affects structural coherence and visual credibility by ensuring the added lines do not distort the character’s silhouette or introduce unnatural textures.",
      "question": "Are the motion lines surrounding the character in Panel 1 smoothly aligned with the direction of motion and free from jagged edges or inconsistent spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding an internal monologue bubble containing \"The jump of a lifetime awaits!\" in Panel 1, this involves inserting a text element near the character’s head. The placement must avoid obscuring facial features or appearing misaligned with the character’s gaze. The font style and size should match the cartoon aesthetic while maintaining legibility and natural integration into the scene.",
      "question": "Is the internal monologue bubble positioned close to the character’s head without overlapping facial features or distorting the character’s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enhancing the sunset backdrop with vibrant gradient colors in Panel 1, this involves modifying the sky area behind the mountain range. The gradient should transition smoothly from warm tones near the horizon to cooler tones above, avoiding abrupt color shifts or artificial banding that could reduce realism. The lighting should remain consistent with the direction of the character’s shadow and overall illumination.",
      "question": "Does the sky background in Panel 1 display a smooth gradient from warm to cool tones without visible color bands or unnatural transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of depicting a parachute deploying in Panel 2, this involves adding a new object (parachute) above the character. The parachute must be anatomically plausible—correctly shaped, properly scaled relative to the character, and attached via cords that follow physical logic. It should not appear floating disconnectedly or clipped through the character’s body.",
      "question": "Is the parachute in Panel 2 correctly shaped, proportionally sized relative to the character, and connected by visible cords that extend logically from the character’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of including animated clouds to boost visual excitement in both panels, this involves adding dynamic cloud shapes with motion blur or layered depth. These clouds must not overlap improperly with the character or mountains, and their texture should resemble natural cloud formations rather than flat or repetitive patterns. Their placement should enhance depth without violating spatial logic.",
      "question": "Do the animated clouds in both panels appear as distinct volumetric forms with soft edges and no clipping into the character or mountain silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
