      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the dress into flowing petals, this question evaluates whether the transformed dress maintains natural material appearance and structural coherence with the body. The original dress has a defined silhouette and pleats; any transformation must preserve proportion and avoid unnatural stretching or folding.",
      "question": "Does the transformed dress retain a coherent shape that follows the contours of the body without visible distortions or broken folds?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting bubbles into glowing lanterns, this question assesses whether the new luminous properties of the bubbles are physically plausible and visually consistent. The original bubbles reflect surroundings; the new version must show internal glow without excessive halo effects or color bleed.",
      "question": "Do the bubbles now appear as glowing lanterns with soft internal illumination and no harsh edges or unnatural light leakage?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding silver strands to the hair, this question checks for seamless integration with the original hair texture and realistic lighting response. Silver strands should follow the same direction and curvature as natural hair and reflect light appropriately.",
      "question": "Are the silver strands in the hair evenly distributed, aligned with the hair flow, and do they reflect light realistically without appearing as separate, floating lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a whimsical path with stars, this question evaluates the spatial consistency and depth integration of the new path. The original path is straight and grounded; the new one must maintain perspective alignment and avoid floating or misaligned elements.",
      "question": "Is the whimsical path aligned with the perspective of the scene and does it feature stars that are embedded within the surface without appearing elevated or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of inserting a moonlit writing space framed by clouds, this question examines the volumetric quality and lighting coherence of the cloud motif. The clouds must appear soft and three-dimensional, with shadows and highlights matching the moonlight source.",
      "question": "Do the cloud frames around the writing space have smooth, rounded edges and subtle shading that matches the ambient moonlight without sharp outlines or flat textures?",
