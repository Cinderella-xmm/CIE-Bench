Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the ornate teapot into a glass sculpture with clear glass for the main structure, evaluate whether the material transformation at the body of the teapot maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows a metallic teapot with embossed floral patterns; the edited version must replace this with transparent glass while preserving the shape and depth of the engravings. The key is to assess if the transition from metal to glass preserves geometric integrity and avoids unnatural textures or distortions.
Question: Does the main body of the teapot appear as clear glass with visible internal reflections and refractions consistent with transparent material, without any opaque or metallic residue?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of incorporating frosted floral patterns that mimic the original engravings, evaluate whether the floral designs on the surface of the glass teapot maintain the same level of detail and depth as in the original. The original features intricate silver engravings of roses and leaves; these must now be rendered as frosted patterns on glass. The assessment focuses on whether the texture of the frost appears natural, evenly distributed, and properly aligned with the underlying form.
Question: Are the floral patterns on the glass surface uniformly frosted with no signs of smudging, uneven opacity, or artificial texture artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of enhancing the handle and spout with tinted amber glass for contrast, evaluate whether the color transition between the clear body and amber-colored components is smooth and physically plausible. The original has a dark wooden handle and metallic spout; replacing them with amber glass requires assessing if the color tone matches expected glass properties and if the edges are clean and free from jagged transitions or color bleeding.
Question: Do the handle and spout exhibit a consistent amber tint with smooth gradients and sharp boundaries, without color fringing or unnatural highlights?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the teapot on a mirrored surface to emphasize transparency and craftsmanship, evaluate whether the reflection beneath the teapot accurately mirrors its shape and details. The original image shows the teapot on a wooden surface; the edited version should show a reflective surface with a clear, undistorted mirror image. This checks for realism in reflection behavior and absence of ghosting or misalignment.
Question: Is the reflection under the teapot symmetrical, sharp, and correctly aligned with the objectâ€™s base, showing accurate contours and transparency effects?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility during material transformation, evaluate whether the overall proportions and geometry of the teapot remain unchanged. The original has a balanced, rounded body with a defined lid, spout, and handle. Any distortion in curvature, thickness, or alignment would compromise authenticity. The focus is on whether the glass version retains the original silhouette and spatial relationships.
Question: Are the proportions of the lid, spout, handle, and body preserved such that there are no stretched, compressed, or misaligned sections compared to the original?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
