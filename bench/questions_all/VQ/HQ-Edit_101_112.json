      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the image into a traditional Japanese woodblock print style, evaluate whether the figure's kimono has been reimagined with intricate patterns and vibrant colors while maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original kimono is dark blue with minimal detail; the edit must introduce stylized patterns without distorting fabric folds or introducing unnatural textures.",
      "question": "Does the kimono display consistent, non-distorted fabric folds with visible, harmonious pattern details that align with the woodblock print aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of stylizing the cherry blossoms and bridge in a woodblock print manner, assess whether the blossoms retain natural petal shapes and distribution while being stylized. The original scene features realistic cherry blossoms falling over water and trees; the edit should enhance their form without causing geometric distortion or unnatural clustering.",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossom petals in the air and on the ground evenly distributed with clear, non-overlapping edges and consistent size variation typical of stylized woodblock art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying a textured matte finish to evoke aged paper, evaluate whether the entire image surface shows uniform texture overlay without disrupting fine details such as facial features, clothing lines, or basket weave. The original image has smooth digital rendering; the added texture should not blur or obscure critical elements.",
      "question": "Is the matte texture applied uniformly across the entire image without obscuring facial features, fabric patterns, or the basket’s weave structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of simplifying the basket as a key cultural item within a harmonious composition, check whether the basket retains its recognizable shape and woven texture but appears less detailed than in the original. The original basket is intricately woven; the edited version should maintain correct proportions and material appearance without unrealistic simplification.",
      "question": "Does the basket preserve its cylindrical shape and handle structure with visible, coherent weaving lines, even if simplified?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of depicting the figure in serene contemplation with stylized detail, assess whether the figure’s posture and facial expression remain anatomically accurate and emotionally coherent. The original figure sits upright with hands folded; any editing should not distort limbs or facial features, especially around the hands and fingers.",
      "question": "Do the hands show five fingers per hand with natural joint alignment and no extra digits or unnatural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
