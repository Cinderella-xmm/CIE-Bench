      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the woman’s body into a marble statue while preserving anatomical proportions, this question evaluates whether the human form maintains structural consistency and visual credibility after material conversion. The original image shows a full-body figure with natural posture; the edited version must retain correct limb alignment, head tilt, and torso position. Any distortion in limbs or joints would compromise realism.",
      "question": "Does the statue's body maintain anatomically accurate proportions and joint alignment, with no bent or elongated limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the saree into marble with engraved gold patterns, this question checks whether the textile details are faithfully rendered as carved textures. The original saree has repeating dot patterns and border designs; these must be preserved in relief form on the stone surface without blurring or missing elements.",
      "question": "Are the gold motifs and patterns on the saree clearly visible as engraved details on the marble surface, with no loss of fine lines or texture degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of repositioning the figure into an elegant standing pose, this question assesses physical plausibility and balance. The original pose is slightly angled; the new pose should reflect classical statuary stance—upright, balanced, with one foot forward—without exaggerated angles or floating limbs.",
      "question": "Is the statue’s standing pose balanced and physically rational, with feet properly grounded and weight distributed naturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering jewelry as engraved accents, this question evaluates whether the necklace, earrings, and bangles are integrated into the marble surface without appearing detached or floating. The original jewelry is metallic and reflective; in the statue version, it must be transformed into incised lines or raised reliefs that match the stone texture.",
      "question": "Are the jewelry elements (necklace, earrings, bangles) seamlessly integrated into the marble surface as engraved or raised details, with no gaps or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a classical pedestal and ornate palace hall, this question checks environmental coherence. The new background must include architectural elements like columns, arches, and flooring that match Renaissance style, with consistent lighting and perspective relative to the statue.",
      "question": "Is the pedestal and surrounding palace hall environment visually coherent, with correct perspective, lighting, and architectural details matching Renaissance style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining texture and color continuity across the statue, this question evaluates whether there are any visible seams, mismatched textures, or abrupt transitions between body, saree, and jewelry areas. Marble should have uniform grain and sheen throughout.",
      "question": "Is the marble texture consistent across the entire statue, with no visible stitching, color shifts, or texture breaks between body, saree, and jewelry areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving anatomical correctness in hand positioning, this question checks whether the hands (especially fingers) remain within natural limits—five fingers per hand, correct spacing, and ergonomic curvature. In the original image, both hands are visible; the edited version must avoid extra digits or distorted shapes.",
      "question": "Do both hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural spacing and curvature, and no deformed or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
