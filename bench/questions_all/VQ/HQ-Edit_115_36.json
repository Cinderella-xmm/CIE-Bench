      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding a golden title banner at the top\" and ensuring it maintains structural coherence with the overall composition, evaluate whether the banner's placement and integration into the image preserve visual credibility. The banner must align properly with the window frame and not obscure or distort the cat’s head or the background sky. The material (golden) should appear consistent with the lighting and shadows in the scene.",
      "question": "Is the golden title banner positioned at the top of the image without overlapping or distorting the cat’s head or the window frame, and does it have a natural metallic sheen that matches the ambient light?",

The nameplate should be proportionally sized and aligned with the card’s framing, avoiding any unnatural shadowing or clipping artifacts.",
      "question": "Is the nameplate located at the bottom of the image without intersecting or deforming the cat’s tail or the wooden floor, and does it have clean edges and consistent material texture?",

The text should be legible and stylistically consistent with the semi-realistic 3D art style.",
      "question": "Are the stat bars clearly visible and positioned without overlapping the cat’s fur or the window, and do they use a font and color scheme that match the overall polished, soft 3D art style?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"framing the card with metallic trim,\" assess whether the trim follows the rectangular boundaries of the card and maintains consistent thickness and reflection properties. It should not introduce jagged edges, mismatched corners, or inconsistent lighting effects that would break the illusion of a physical card.",

The cat’s fur should retain its original texture and volume, and the window background should remain consistent with the clear sky seen in the original image.",
      "question": "Is the overall image rendered in a consistent semi-realistic 3D style where the cat’s fur, window details, and added elements like the banner and stat bars all exhibit smooth textures and no pixelation, blurring, or geometric distortions?",
