      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the wooden exterior with transparent faceted crystal surfaces, this question evaluates whether the new crystal material appears physically plausible and maintains the original cabin's structural form. The focus is on whether the transition from wood to crystal preserves geometric accuracy and avoids unnatural textures or jagged edges.",
      "question": "Are the crystal facets on the cabin’s walls, roof, and windows evenly shaped and aligned with the original cabin’s triangular and rectangular outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering the crystal surfaces with hues of blue and green, this question assesses whether the coloration reflects realistic light behavior on transparent materials, such as subtle gradients and refraction effects, rather than flat or artificial coloring.",
      "question": "Do the blue and green hues on the crystal surfaces show variations in transparency and light reflection consistent with real glass or crystal, rather than uniform solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming wooden beams into multifaceted crystal edges, this question checks whether the structural supports retain their original positions and proportions while being reimagined as crystal forms, ensuring no distortion or misalignment occurs.",
      "question": "Are the vertical support beams and horizontal railings converted into crystal forms that maintain their original spacing, height, and alignment with the cabin’s frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the cabin on a flat white marble platform, this question evaluates whether the platform is uniformly smooth, level, and seamlessly connected to the base of the crystal structure, without visible seams or textural inconsistencies.",
      "question": "Is the white marble platform beneath the cabin flat, continuous, and free of cracks or irregularities, and does it extend evenly under the entire base of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding small crystal formations as decorative accents at the base, this question checks whether these elements are proportionally sized, naturally distributed, and integrated without disrupting the scene’s balance or appearing artificially placed.",
      "question": "Are the small crystal formations along the base of the cabin proportionally smaller than the main structure, grouped in clusters, and positioned in a way that suggests natural growth rather than random placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
