      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the cityscape and car into a 3D miniature scene encased in a crystal-clear resin cube, evaluate whether the entire scene is enclosed within a transparent, uniformly shaped cubic structure with consistent refractive properties. This involves checking if the edges of the cube are visible and geometrically accurate, and whether light refraction effects (such as distortion or bending of objects near edges) are present and plausible. The presence of a resin cube affects overall realism and visual credibility.",
      "question": "Is the entire cityscape and car enclosed within a transparent, geometrically perfect cube with consistent refractive qualities that distort surrounding elements naturally?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of stylizing vehicles with sleek, futuristic design using metallic and reflective textures, assess the car’s surface material. The original silver McLaren has a realistic metallic finish; after editing, the texture must retain fine details such as reflections, glossiness, and depth without introducing unnatural sheen, pixelation, or inconsistent highlights. Reflective properties should match lighting conditions inside the resin cube.",
      "question": "Does the car's surface exhibit a uniform, high-quality metallic texture with natural reflections and no artifacts like blotches, smudges, or missing specular highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to shrink skyscrapers to emphasize depth and scale, examine the proportionality of buildings relative to the car. In the original image, the skyscrapers are tall but proportional to the street and vehicle. After shrinking, they should maintain architectural integrity—no distorted windows, warped facades, or disproportionate heights. Their reduced size must still align with perspective logic.",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers scaled down uniformly and proportionally without geometric distortions such as stretched windows, skewed angles, or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to infuse skyscrapers with micro LED lights mimicking illuminated windows, evaluate whether the windows now contain small, evenly distributed points of light that resemble LEDs. These lights should not appear as overexposed blobs, uneven clusters, or non-physical glows. They must integrate naturally into the glass surfaces without disrupting the building’s structural appearance.",
      "question": "Do the windows of the skyscrapers display small, consistent, and physically plausible light points resembling micro LEDs without haloing, bleeding, or unnatural brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to add delicate micro foliage for trees while maintaining rich green tones, check whether the tree canopies have been replaced with finer, more detailed leaves that suggest miniaturization. The foliage should retain natural color variation and density, avoiding flat shading, jagged edges, or artificial-looking textures. It must contrast appropriately with the urban environment.",
      "question": "Do the trees feature finely detailed, dense green foliage with natural color variation and no pixelation or blocky rendering, indicating proper micro-scale modeling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
