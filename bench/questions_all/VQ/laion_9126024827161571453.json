      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining proportional relationships in the anthropomorphized batteries (originally located at the bottom center), this question evaluates whether the transformation into robot figures preserves geometric integrity, particularly in limb-to-body ratios and head placement relative to the original cylindrical shape.",
      "question": "Do the robot figures derived from the batteries have limbs and heads that are proportionally sized and attached in a way that maintains structural coherence with their original cylindrical form?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving the copper and black material properties, this question checks whether the surface textures of the robot bodies reflect natural metallic finishes consistent with the original batteries' appearance, avoiding unnatural glossiness or flatness.",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the robot figures made from the batteries rendered with a consistent metallic texture that mimics copper and black materials without visible artifacts like checkerboard patterns or unnatural reflections?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating a digital cityscape background, this question assesses whether the environment is layered appropriately behind the robot figures, with proper lighting direction and depth cues that prevent visual conflict with the foreground.",
      "question": "Is the digital cityscape background positioned behind the robot figures with correct layering, atmospheric gradient, and light source alignment that matches the direction of illumination on the robots?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of embedding a digital screen showing “10 Years in Storage,” this question evaluates whether the screen appears as a coherent, non-disruptive UI element with clear text, consistent border design, and realistic glow or backlighting.",
      "question": "Is the digital screen displaying “10 Years in Storage” seamlessly integrated into the scene with readable text, smooth edges, and ambient lighting that matches the sci-fi theme without pixelation or distortion?",
