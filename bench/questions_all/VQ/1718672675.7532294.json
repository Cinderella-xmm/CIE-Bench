      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming jagged rock formations into armor plating while maintaining structural consistency with the original sedimentary layers, evaluate whether the edited rock surfaces retain natural layering and erosion patterns, or if they show unnatural flatness, sharp edges, or mismatched textures that break geological realism.",
      "question": "Do the armor-like rock sections maintain visible sedimentary layering and natural erosion contours consistent with the surrounding cliff face?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that moss should act as natural embellishments on the armor, assess whether moss is distributed in biologically plausible locations (e.g., crevices, shaded areas) and exhibits realistic texture variation, or if it appears uniformly applied or digitally painted in unnatural patches.",
      "question": "Is the moss growth confined to shaded or moist areas of the rock armor and does it show natural variation in density and color rather than uniform application?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the water below should become flowing spectral limbs, evaluate whether the ethereal limbs emerge from the cliff base in a way that respects water flow dynamics and depth perception, and whether they blend seamlessly with the sea surface without floating above it or appearing disconnected.",
      "question": "Do the spectral limbs originate from the cliff base and merge with the sea surface in a way that preserves water-level continuity and avoids floating or detached appearance?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that small trees form a textured mane, assess whether the trees are positioned in a way that follows natural forest distribution patterns along the cliff ridge, and whether their spacing and orientation suggest organic growth rather than artificial arrangement.",
      "question": "Are the trees forming the mane spaced irregularly and angled naturally along the cliff edge, consistent with wind exposure and terrain slope?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that runes are carved into the rock surface following natural fractures, evaluate whether the runes align with existing cracks and erosion lines, and whether their edges show subtle wear and lighting consistency with the surrounding rock, avoiding sharp, glowing, or over-defined outlines.",
      "question": "Do the runes follow natural rock fissures and exhibit soft edges with shadowing that matches ambient lighting, rather than appearing as crisp, untextured overlays?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that clouds are replaced with ethereal spirits spiraling around the titan, assess whether these spirits interact with light and atmosphere realistically—such as casting soft shadows, refracting sunlight, and appearing translucent—rather than floating independently or clashing with the sky’s gradient.",
      "question": "Do the spiraling spirits emit or absorb light in a way that matches the sun's position and create subtle volume effects consistent with mist or vapor, without sharp edges or unnatural opacity?",
