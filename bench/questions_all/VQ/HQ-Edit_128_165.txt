Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction involves transforming the ornate metal lantern into a mythical, luminescent jellyfish. This transformation requires replacing the rigid metallic structure with flexible, iridescent tendrils and converting the glass panels into a translucent bell-shaped body. The intricate geometric patterns must be replaced with swirling bioluminescent designs, and glowing star-like nodules should be added along the tendrils. The entire scene must shift from a terrestrial indoor setting to an ethereal underwater environment. The original image features a detailed, symmetrical metal lantern hanging from a wooden ceiling, casting complex shadows on the white walls. The key elements to transform are the lantern’s body (central dome), top cap, bottom finial, hanging chain, and the surrounding architectural context (ceiling beams and wall textures). The transformation must preserve structural coherence while introducing biological plausibility and visual harmony in the new form.
-Sub requirement 1: The central dome of the lantern (original glass panel section) must be transformed into a translucent bell-shaped body that maintains smooth curvature and natural translucency without visible seams or unnatural texture transitions.
-Sub requirement 2: The metal framework of the lantern must morph into iridescent, flowing tendrils that extend downward in a biologically plausible manner, avoiding rigid angles or mechanical joints.
-Sub requirement 3: The intricate cut-out patterns on the lantern must be replaced with organic, swirling bioluminescent designs that appear fluid and continuous, not pixelated or artificially rendered.
-Sub requirement 4: Glowing star-like nodules must be added along the tendrils; these must emit soft light without harsh edges or digital artifacts, and their placement must follow a natural distribution pattern.
-Sub requirement 5: The surrounding environment must be recontextualized as an underwater realm, including changes in lighting (diffused blue-green tones), water particles, and depth cues, while preserving the original ceiling structure’s position and scale for continuity.
-Sub requirement 6: The transition from the original hanging chain to the jellyfish’s attachment point must be seamless, with no abrupt breaks or floating elements, ensuring physical rationality.
-Sub requirement 7: The overall composition must maintain spatial coherence—elements such as shadows, light diffusion, and perspective must align with an underwater setting, avoiding inconsistencies in light direction or shadow cast.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the central dome into a translucent bell-shaped body, this question evaluates whether the surface of the new bell shape appears uniformly translucent with smooth gradients and no visible stitching or artificial texture artifacts. The material should resemble living tissue or gelatinous matter rather than glass or metal.
Question: Does the bell-shaped body of the jellyfish have a consistent translucent appearance with no sharp edges, visible seams, or unnatural texture patches?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the metal framework into iridescent tendrils, this question assesses whether the tendrils flow naturally from the main body, exhibit smooth curvature, and display iridescence without pixelation or abrupt color shifts. The geometry must avoid mechanical rigidity and mimic organic movement.
Question: Are the tendrils extending from the jellyfish's body smooth, curved, and iridescent, with no angular distortions or segmented appearances?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing geometric patterns with swirling bioluminescent designs, this question checks if the internal glow patterns are fluid, continuous, and organic in shape, avoiding sharp lines or repetitive digital motifs that would suggest artificial rendering.
Question: Do the internal glowing patterns within the jellyfish's bell appear as natural, swirling bioluminescent designs without repeating geometric shapes or jagged edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding glowing star-like nodules along the tendrils, this question evaluates whether these nodules emit soft, diffused light with realistic falloff and are evenly spaced in a way that suggests biological growth, not random placement or digital over-rendering.
Question: Are the glowing nodules along the tendrils softly illuminated with gradual light spread and positioned in a natural, non-uniform but plausible arrangement?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of recontextualizing the environment as an underwater realm, this question examines whether the lighting has shifted to a diffuse, blue-green hue typical of underwater scenes, and whether there are subtle water particles or depth effects present, while maintaining the original ceiling structure’s relative position and scale.
Question: Is the ambient lighting in the scene diffused and tinted with blue-green hues, and are there faint water particles or depth cues visible around the jellyfish, consistent with an underwater environment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining a seamless transition from the original hanging chain to the jellyfish’s attachment point, this question checks whether the connection between the jellyfish and the ceiling is physically plausible—such as a gentle tapering or organic fusion—without floating or disconnected parts.
Question: Is the connection point between the jellyfish and the ceiling smooth and continuous, with no floating segments or abrupt breaks in structure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
