Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction involves transforming the original terracotta horse sculpture into a high-end collectible product packaging. This includes adding a transparent showcase box with gold accents, placing a modern brand logo on a black base stand, inserting an ancient Chinese motif backdrop inside the box, and designing a magnetic closure. These additions are external to the original sculpture and must be visually integrated without distorting or altering the core sculpture. The original sculpture is centrally positioned, with visible details such as the mane, saddle, legs, and painted traces of red pigment. The edits must preserve the structural integrity of the horse while introducing new elements that appear physically plausible and aesthetically coherent.

-Sub requirement 1: Adding a transparent showcase box around the horse—does it maintain visual clarity and structural coherence without introducing unnatural refraction, distortion, or misalignment with the horse’s shape?

-Sub requirement 2: Incorporating gold accents on the box—do they appear consistent in material and reflectivity with realistic metallic properties, avoiding artificial shine or color inconsistencies?

-Sub requirement 3: Placing a modern brand logo on the black base stand—does the logo integrate naturally in terms of scale, typography, and contrast, without appearing pixelated or misaligned?

-Sub requirement 4: Inserting an ancient Chinese motif backdrop inside the box—does the pattern align correctly with the depth and perspective of the box, maintaining cultural authenticity and avoiding warping or clipping artifacts?

-Sub requirement 5: Designing a magnetic closure mechanism for the box—does it appear structurally plausible (e.g., correct placement of hinges or seals), without violating physical logic or showing gaps or overlaps?

-Sub requirement 6: Preserving the original horse sculpture—does its surface texture, coloration, and anatomical features remain intact and unaltered by the overlaying elements?

-Sub requirement 7: Ensuring all added elements (box, base, backdrop, logo) do not obscure or distort key parts of the horse, such as the head, legs, or saddle area, preserving visual credibility.

Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a transparent showcase box around the horse, evaluate whether the box maintains visual clarity and structural coherence. The box should encase the horse without distorting its form or introducing optical anomalies like ghosting, reflection errors, or incorrect transparency gradients. The edges of the box must align precisely with the horse’s silhouette.
Question: Is the transparent showcase box fully aligned with the horse’s outline and free from visual distortions such as warped edges, double images, or unnatural light refractions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of incorporating gold accents on the box, assess whether these elements exhibit realistic metallic properties. Gold accents should have consistent color, reflectivity, and thickness, matching typical premium packaging materials. They must not appear flat, overly shiny, or mismatched in tone with surrounding surfaces.
Question: Do the gold accents on the showcase box have uniform color and reflective properties consistent with polished metal, without unnatural highlights or color bleeding?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing a modern brand logo on the black base stand, evaluate whether the logo appears properly scaled, sharply rendered, and positioned without overlapping or clipping. The logo should not introduce jagged edges, low-resolution artifacts, or textural inconsistencies.
Question: Is the brand logo clearly legible, properly centered on the black base stand, and free from pixelation or blurring?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of inserting an ancient Chinese motif backdrop inside the box, assess whether the pattern is correctly placed within the depth of the box and maintains proper perspective. The design should not appear stretched, clipped, or misaligned with the box’s interior geometry.
Question: Does the internal backdrop pattern follow the correct perspective of the box and avoid warping, tiling errors, or partial cutoffs at the edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of designing a magnetic closure for the box, evaluate whether the closure mechanism (e.g., hinge, seal, or flap) appears physically plausible and logically positioned. It should not create gaps, misalignments, or floating elements that violate structural logic.
Question: Is the magnetic closure mechanism visibly integrated into the box structure without gaps, overlaps, or floating components that suggest mechanical impossibility?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving the original horse sculpture, assess whether its surface details—such as the mane, saddle, and red pigment traces—are unaltered and visible through the transparent box. The sculpture should not be obscured, distorted, or shadowed in a way that reduces perceived authenticity.
Question: Are all visible parts of the horse sculpture (including the head, legs, saddle, and painted areas) clearly preserved and unobscured by the added packaging elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
