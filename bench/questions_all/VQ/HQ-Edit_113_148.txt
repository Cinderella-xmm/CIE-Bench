Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the sandcastle and beach scene into translucent crystal sculptures. This involves a complete material transformation of the sandcastle (originally made of sand) into faceted clear crystals with soft blue highlights. The original sandcastle is located on the right side of the image, featuring multiple towers, turrets, and flags. This change affects both the texture and structure of the castle. The perceptual quality concern lies in whether the new crystalline form maintains structural coherence, geometric integrity, and natural-looking transparency without introducing unnatural edges or distortions. The replacement must preserve the original architectural layout while changing material properties.
-Sub requirement 1: Transform the sandcastle into a translucent crystal structure with faceted surfaces and soft blue highlights; evaluate whether the new material appears physically plausible, retains the original geometry, and avoids artifacts such as jagged edges, inconsistent transparency, or unnatural reflections.

-<Thinking Process 2>: The seashells scattered across the wet sand near the base of the sandcastle and along the shoreline are to be replaced with small, polished gemstones in pastel hues. These shells are clearly visible in the foreground and midground—some partially submerged in shallow water. Replacing them with gemstones alters both shape and material. The key perceptual quality issue is whether the new gemstones appear smooth, uniformly polished, and naturally placed without disrupting the surrounding environment or showing mismatched textures.
-Sub requirement 2: Replace all seashells with pastel-colored gemstones; assess whether the new objects maintain consistent material appearance, realistic proportions relative to the environment, and natural placement without floating or overlapping incorrectly.

-<Thinking Process 3>: The ocean, originally depicted with rolling waves and foam, is to be reimagined as a wave pattern etched into a frosted glass slab. This transforms a dynamic, fluid element into a static, solid surface. The original ocean occupies the background from the horizon to the shoreline. The challenge is maintaining visual plausibility—does the etched pattern resemble real waves? Is the frosted glass effect consistent across the surface? Does it retain depth cues and lighting consistency?
-Sub requirement 3: Convert the ocean into an etched wave pattern on frosted glass; evaluate whether the surface texture mimics real glass, the wave lines are continuous and anatomically plausible, and the lighting interaction (e.g., reflections, translucency) is coherent with a solid material.

-<Thinking Process 4>: The entire scene is to be placed within a minimalist gallery display case. This implies a shift from an open beach environment to an enclosed, curated space. The original image has no enclosure—open sky, horizon, and unbounded sand. Introducing a display case means adding transparent walls, possibly a base platform, and controlled lighting. This affects composition and perspective. The key question is whether the added elements (like glass panels or frame) are seamlessly integrated without distorting the original scene’s scale or introducing clipping artifacts.
-Sub requirement 4: Place the transformed elements inside a minimalist gallery display case; check whether the case boundaries are visually consistent, do not obscure key elements, and maintain proper spatial relationships with the internal objects.

-<Thinking Process 5>: The red plastic shovel with yellow handle remains in the foreground but may now exist within a glass case. Its presence should not conflict with the new material theme unless modified. However, since it's a man-made object, its integration into a crystal-gemstone theme must be evaluated for material contrast and realism. If unchanged, does it appear out of place? If altered, does the modification introduce distortion?
-Sub requirement 5: Evaluate the shovel’s compatibility with the new environment—whether it remains intact and logically placed, or if it has been altered in a way that preserves its form and avoids material inconsistencies.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the sandcastle into a translucent crystal structure with faceted surfaces and soft blue highlights, this question evaluates whether the material transition maintains structural coherence and physical plausibility. The original sandcastle has distinct towers and turrets; the edited version must preserve these shapes while replacing sand with crystal. The focus is on whether the facets are evenly distributed, the transparency is consistent, and there are no broken edges or missing parts.
Question: Are the crystal facets on the sandcastle uniformly shaped and aligned with the original tower geometry, without any jagged or incomplete edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing seashells with pastel-colored gemstones, this question assesses whether the new objects have a natural, polished appearance and are properly integrated into the scene. The shells are located near the base of the castle and in shallow water. The gemstones must match their size and distribution while avoiding unnatural sheen or floating effects.
Question: Do the gemstones replace the seashells accurately in position and size, and do they exhibit smooth, reflective surfaces without floating above the sand or water?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the ocean into an etched wave pattern on frosted glass, this question evaluates whether the surface texture realistically simulates glass and maintains wave-like patterns. The original ocean had motion and foam; the new version must convey similar forms through etching. The focus is on continuity of lines and consistency of frosting.
Question: Is the wave pattern on the frosted glass surface continuous and flowing, with no abrupt breaks or unnatural line interruptions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the scene inside a minimalist gallery display case, this question checks whether the enclosure is visually consistent and does not distort the scene. The case should be transparent and frame the content without cutting off elements or creating reflection anomalies.
Question: Are the edges of the display case visible and straight, with no clipping or warping of the internal elements, and do they align with the perspective of the scene?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of evaluating the shovel’s compatibility with the new environment, this question checks whether the object remains intact and logically positioned. The shovel is in the foreground, partially submerged in water. In the new setting, it must either remain unchanged or be rendered consistently with the glass case.
Question: Is the red shovel with yellow handle fully visible and undistorted, lying flat on the surface without intersecting or appearing behind glass where it shouldn’t be?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
