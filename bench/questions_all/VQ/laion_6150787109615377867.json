      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the tabletop into a polished rotating gear with intricate engravings, this question evaluates whether the surface texture of the new gear matches the expected appearance of machined metal, with visible engraved lines and consistent reflection patterns. It checks for unnatural textures such as pixelation, inconsistent shading, or mismatched highlights that would suggest poor rendering.",
      "question": "Does the gear surface on the tabletop show consistent metallic sheen and detailed engravings without blurred or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the four straight legs into articulated piston-driven limbs, this question assesses whether the new limb structure maintains proper joint articulation and proportionality relative to the central column and base. It checks for structural distortions such as misaligned joints, incorrect angles, or disproportionate segment lengths that would violate mechanical logic.",
      "question": "Are the piston-driven limbs symmetrically arranged and proportionally scaled to the central column, with clearly defined joints and no bent or broken segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding steam vents along the central column, this question examines whether these elements are placed at logical intervals and rendered with appropriate depth and material consistency (e.g., small cylindrical nozzles with slight protrusion). It checks for floating or misplaced vents and ensures they integrate seamlessly into the columnâ€™s surface.",
      "question": "Are the steam vents evenly spaced along the central column and properly embedded into the metal surface without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of embellishing the base with cog patterns and rotating dials, this question evaluates whether the added mechanical details (such as interlocking cogs and dial faces) are geometrically accurate and correctly aligned with the base's star-shaped structure. It checks for distorted shapes, missing teeth on cogs, or overlapping elements that break visual coherence.",
      "question": "Do the cog patterns and dials on the base have intact geometric shapes with uniform spacing and no overlapping or incomplete features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating brass and copper accents into the structure, this question checks whether these materials are visually distinguishable from the base stainless steel through appropriate color variation and reflectivity. It ensures there are no abrupt color transitions or texture mismatches that would suggest artificial blending.",
      "question": "Are the brass and copper accents clearly differentiated from the silver metal by color and reflectivity, without unnatural gradients or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
