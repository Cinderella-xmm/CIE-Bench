Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the naval uniform with a brown leather trench coat, brass gears, and mechanical details, evaluate whether the new clothing maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows a detailed navy blue military coat with gold trim and structured epaulets. The replacement must preserve anatomical fit and material consistency, especially around joints and overlapping layers. This includes assessing whether the leather texture appears natural, seams are logically placed, and mechanical elements like gears integrate without distorting the garment’s silhouette.
Question: Does the brown leather trench coat have consistent texture and natural folds that align with human body contours, and are the brass gears and mechanical details integrated without disrupting the coat's structural integrity?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of substituting the bell with a gadget-like chronometer, assess whether the new object is proportionally correct and physically plausible in the hand. In the original image, the officer holds a small golden bell in his right hand, which is clearly visible and positioned naturally. The replacement object must match the scale of the hand, maintain proper lighting and shadow interaction, and appear as if it could be held by a human hand without unnatural stretching or deformation.
Question: Is the chronometer held in the right hand proportionally sized relative to the hand, with realistic shadows and reflections, and does it maintain a natural grip without distorted fingers or misplaced joints?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding goggles to the tricorne hat, evaluate whether the goggles are realistically attached to the hat without altering its shape or causing unnatural shadows or overlaps. The original image shows a well-defined tricorne hat with a gold trim and a decorative emblem. The addition of goggles must not distort the hat’s geometry or create floating elements; they should appear securely mounted and consistent with the lighting direction.
Question: Are the goggles positioned on the tricorne hat in a way that respects the hat’s structure, with no floating parts, unnatural shadows, or clipping errors between the goggles and the hat?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of changing the backdrop to a sky with airships and floating cities, evaluate whether the background transition maintains visual coherence and depth. The original image features a sunset beach scene with soft waves and a warm horizon. The new background must include airships and floating structures that are properly scaled, lit, and spatially arranged to avoid confusion with the foreground figure. The lighting should match the time of day and direction of the sun.
Question: Do the airships and floating cities in the background appear at appropriate distances, with consistent lighting and atmospheric perspective, and do they not overlap or obscure the subject unnaturally?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining overall realism and avoiding artifacts such as unnatural textures or loss of fine details, evaluate whether the edited image retains clarity and detail across all modified areas. Specifically, check for pixelation, blurring, or repetitive patterns in materials like leather, metal, or fabric, especially in high-detail zones such as the coat’s stitching, gear mechanisms, and facial features.
Question: Are the textures of the leather coat, brass gears, and other materials free from unnatural repetition, blurring, or artificial edges, and do fine details such as stitching and rivets remain sharp and consistent?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
