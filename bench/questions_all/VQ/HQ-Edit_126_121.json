      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the central artwork of the gorilla holding bananas must be preserved without distortion, evaluate whether the gorillaâ€™s facial features, fur texture, and hand positioning remain consistent with the original image. Specifically, check if the fingers are correctly shaped and count (five per hand), and if the bananas are held naturally without unnatural bending or clipping.",
      "question": "Are the gorilla's hands holding the bananas with five fingers each, and do the fingers have natural curvature and skin texture without deformation?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the cereal box packaging must not introduce unnatural edges or lighting mismatches, assess the boundary between the gorilla and the box. Check for sharp, artificial edges, inconsistent lighting, or shadow discrepancies that suggest poor integration.",
      "question": "Does the edge of the cereal box blend naturally with the gorilla and background, without visible seams or lighting discontinuities?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that vibrant greens and yellows must harmonize with the original scene, evaluate whether the added colors in the packaging match the ambient lighting and do not create unnatural highlights or flat areas.",
      "question": "Are the green and yellow colors on the cereal box consistent with the lighting and tone of the jungle environment, without abrupt shifts or oversaturated patches?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that banana motifs and leafy accents must be seamlessly integrated, check if these elements cast proper shadows, have correct depth, and do not appear as flat overlays with no interaction with the surrounding surfaces.",
      "question": "Do the banana motifs and leaf patterns on the box have realistic shadows and depth, matching the lighting direction of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question": "Is the back panel illustration composed with correct perspective and scale, and is the text clearly readable without covering important parts of the gorilla or bananas?",
