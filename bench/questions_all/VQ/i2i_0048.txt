Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of enhancing contrast and local sharpness while maintaining structural coherence and avoiding unnatural textures, assess if the zebra stripes and surrounding grass in the edited image remain visually plausible and artifact-free.
Question: Are the stripes on the zebra sharp and distinct without any unnatural pixelation or blurring?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement to highlight textures and maintain a natural appearance, check if the enhancement process alters or introduces any unnatural textures in the zebra's fur.
Question: Do the zebra's fur textures appear natural without any visible artificial streaks or patterns?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: With the focus on maintaining overall authenticity and natural appearance, verify that the enhancement does not distort the zebra's proportions or introduce any geometric irregularities.
Question: Are the proportions of the zebra's body consistent and free from any geometric distortions like warping or stretching?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of keeping the original composition intact while enhancing the image, evaluate if the background and foreground elements retain their relative positions and do not exhibit any structural inconsistencies.
Question: Does the relative position between the zebra and the background grassland remain unchanged and natural?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: To ensure the absence of obvious artifacts and degradation of fine details during enhancement, inspect if the fine details such as the grass blades and the zebra's hooves preserve their clarity.
Question: Are the grass blades and the zebra's hooves detailed and free from any loss of sharpness or introduction of noise?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
