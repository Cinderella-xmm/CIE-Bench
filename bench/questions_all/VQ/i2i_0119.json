      "question": "Does the keychain version of the character maintain the same proportions and colors as the original image, without any visible distortion or unnatural textures?",

      "thinking_process": "The sub requirement of ensuring visual plausibility and structural coherence when placing the keychain on a wooden office desk necessitates checking if the spatial relationship between the keychain and the desk appears natural and logical.",
      "question": "Does the keychain appear naturally placed on the desk with appropriate shadows and reflections, indicating a realistic interaction with the surface?",

      "thinking_process": "To meet the sub requirement of avoiding unnatural artifacts and preserving fine details while positioning the keychain next to books and glasses, it is essential to verify if these additional items blend well into the scene without disrupting visual consistency.",
      "question": "Are the books and glasses placed next to the keychain rendered with realistic textures and a consistent level of detail, without any obvious artifacts or inconsistencies?",

      "thinking_process": "As the sub requirement emphasizes the absence of obvious artifacts and structural consistency, this requires us to scrutinize the edges of the keychain and surrounding objects, ensuring that their boundaries are crisp, and there are no unintended overlaps or breaks.",
      "question": "Are the edges of the keychain and its neighboring objects (books, glasses, desk) crisp and well-defined, with no signs of blending or breaking apart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "To comply with the sub requirement of ensuring a natural appearance and structural rationality, particularly concerning the books and glasses, one must ensure that they are positioned in a manner consistent with their physical properties and expected use.",
      "question": "Do the books and glasses exhibit proper orientation and placement on the desk, reflecting typical real-world scenarios where they would be found?",
