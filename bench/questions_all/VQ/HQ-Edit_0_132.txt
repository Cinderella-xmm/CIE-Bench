Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the three Tai Chi practitioners into figures within a Song Dynasty ink painting style, this involves modifying their appearance to resemble poets in elegant robes with calligraphy-inspired gestures. The editing targets are the figures located near the lake: one in the foreground (right side), one on the small island in the middle ground, and one on the left bank. This transformation affects shape, color, material, and gesture. The question evaluates whether the new style maintains natural proportions and structural coherence without distorting human anatomy or introducing unnatural textures.
Question: Do the three figures retain anatomically correct body proportions and natural hand shapes (with no more than five fingers per hand) after being stylized as ink-painting poets?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of rendering the willows and lotuses as brushstroke-rendered elements, the editing targets are the weeping willow trees along the banks and the lotus plants in the foreground and water. This style conversion aims to emulate traditional ink wash techniques. The question checks whether the brushstroke effect is applied consistently and naturally across these elements without breaking geometric continuity or creating unnatural textures.
Question: Are the willow branches and lotus leaves rendered with smooth, flowing brushstrokes that preserve their natural form and do not exhibit jagged edges or texture artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of styling distant mountains as misty ink washes, the editing target is the mountain range in the background behind the lake. This transformation involves altering the texture and opacity of the mountains to simulate traditional Chinese ink wash techniques. The question assesses whether the transition from solid forms to misty gradients is seamless and visually plausible, avoiding abrupt changes or unnatural blurring.
Question: Does the mountain background feature soft, layered ink-wash gradients that blend naturally with the surrounding mist and sky without sharp transitions or artificial blur effects?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of depicting the figures with flowing calligraphy-inspired gestures, the editing target is the posture and hand positions of all three figures, especially the foreground figure performing a Tai Chi-like pose. This involves evaluating whether the limbs and hands maintain ergonomic plausibility and fluidity consistent with both human movement and artistic expression in ink painting.
Question: Do the arm and hand positions of the figures show natural joint alignment and fluid motion, with no bent or missing fingers or unnatural limb extensions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining overall authenticity and visual credibility through style conversion, the editing target includes the entire sceneâ€”particularly the interaction between the figures, water, flora, and background. The question evaluates whether the integration of ink painting elements preserves spatial depth and compositional balance without introducing inconsistencies such as floating objects or mismatched lighting.
Question: Are the ink-style elements (figures, willows, lotuses, mountains) harmoniously integrated into the scene with consistent lighting, shadow, and depth cues, and do they avoid appearing detached or misplaced?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
