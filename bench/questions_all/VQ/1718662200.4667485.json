      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adjusting the pig’s proportions to have a larger head and smaller body, evaluate whether the scaling of the head relative to the body maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows a pig with proportionally balanced features; altering this requires checking if the new proportions result in unnatural elongation, compression, or geometric distortion, especially at the neck and torso junction.",
      "question": "Is the head of the pig significantly larger than the body without causing visible distortions in the neck or shoulder area?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the sunglasses from red to green, assess whether the color change is applied uniformly and consistently across the lens and frame, preserving material appearance (e.g., reflective surface, edge sharpness) without introducing chromatic aberrations or texture artifacts. The original image shows red round sunglasses with clear reflections; replacing them with green must maintain similar optical properties.",
      "question": "Are the green sunglasses properly rendered with consistent color and reflective properties matching the original style, without unnatural edges or texture breaks?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of depicting the pig in a DJing pose, evaluate whether the hands are positioned naturally on the turntable, maintaining anatomical accuracy (e.g., five fingers, correct hand shape, realistic joint angles). The original image shows the pig's hands interacting with DJ equipment; any editing must preserve ergonomic posture and avoid extra fingers or misshapen limbs.",
      "question": "Do the pig's hands on the turntable have five fingers each, with natural finger spacing and curvature that match typical animal anatomy?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a disco-themed watercolor background, assess whether the background elements (e.g., light streaks, colors, gradients) blend naturally with the foreground subject without harsh transitions or pixelation. The original image has a dark, focused stage environment; replacing it with watercolor should not introduce artificial textures or inconsistencies in lighting direction.",
      "question": "Does the watercolor background integrate smoothly with the pig and DJ equipment, showing no abrupt edges or conflicting lighting patterns?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of including blank chat bubbles framed by soundwave patterns, evaluate whether these added elements are visually coherent—specifically, whether the chat bubbles have clean outlines, proper transparency, and soundwave patterns that follow plausible waveforms without jagged lines or aliasing. These should be placed without overlapping critical facial or equipment features.",
      "question": "Are the chat bubbles and surrounding soundwave patterns clearly defined, free of jagged edges, and positioned without obstructing key features like the face or turntable?",
