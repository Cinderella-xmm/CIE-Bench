      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"cartoonizing the worker slightly and enlarging hands to emphasize tea picking,\" this involves modifying the proportions of the hands relative to the body. The original image shows a realistic human figure with natural hand size and proportion. Enlarging the hands must be done without distorting the overall anatomy or causing unnatural joint angles, finger count, or texture. The question evaluates whether the hand enlargement maintains structural coherence and ergonomic plausibility.",
      "question": "Are the hands enlarged but still anatomically correct with five fingers, natural joint positions, and no distorted shapes?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"using vibrant green and earthy tones for the fields,\" the editing involves enhancing or altering the color palette of the tea plantation. The original image features natural green hues with depth and variation. The modification should preserve realistic gradients and avoid oversaturation or unnatural color transitions that could break visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are the green tones in the tea field vibrant yet consistent with natural plant colors, showing smooth gradients without abrupt shifts or artificial-looking patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"incorporating gold foil for the sack's logo,\" the original image shows a white and orange sack with printed text and a circular logo. Adding a gold foil effect requires simulating metallic reflectivity and sheen without introducing pixelation, misalignment, or unnatural highlights. This affects material realism and surface texture authenticity.",
      "question": "Does the gold foil effect on the sack’s logo appear as a smooth, reflective metallic layer without jagged edges, unnatural glare, or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding vine-patterned borders\" around the postcard, the original image has no border. Introducing decorative elements must not obscure or distort the main subject or background. The vine pattern should follow natural botanical forms and integrate seamlessly into the composition without breaking spatial logic or appearing pasted on unnaturally.",
      "question": "Are the vine-patterned borders present along the edges of the image, following natural leaf and stem structures without overlapping or clipping into the main scene?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"presenting in a recycled paper album,\" the final output is expected to simulate a textured, aged paper surface. This involves applying a subtle paper grain and slight imperfections like creases or discoloration. The texture must not interfere with the clarity of the image content or cause blurring or ghosting of underlying details.",
      "question": "Is the recycled paper texture applied uniformly across the entire image without obscuring fine details such as the worker’s hair, clothing folds, or tea leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
