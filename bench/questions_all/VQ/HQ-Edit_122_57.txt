Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction requires transforming the ornate vase into a crystal sculpture with clear faceted surfaces, which involves replacing the original material (ceramic with painted figures) with transparent crystal. This change affects the overall realism and natural appearance because the original vase has intricate painted designs and gold embellishments that must be replaced with etched patterns while maintaining structural coherence. The transformation must preserve the vase’s shape and proportions to avoid geometric distortion, especially around the handles, base, and neck. The new material must appear transparent and reflective without introducing unnatural textures or surface artifacts.
-Sub requirement 1: Replace the ceramic vase with a crystal version that maintains the original shape and proportions, ensuring the transition from opaque painted surface to transparent faceted crystal does not introduce distortions or unnatural textures.

-Thinking process 2: The floral art on the vase is to be replaced with etched crystal patterns in abstract floral designs. This involves removing the existing painted scenes (including the female figure and floral motifs) and replacing them with engraved or etched patterns. The new design must be consistent with the crystal material—etched lines should appear delicate and integrated into the surface, not superimposed or blurry. The replacement must preserve visual credibility by matching the depth and clarity expected of crystal engraving.
-Sub requirement 2: Replace the painted decorative panels on the vase with etched abstract floral patterns in crystal, ensuring the etching appears naturally integrated into the crystal surface without blurring, over-sharpness, or unnatural line thickness.

-Thinking process 3: The flowers in the bouquet are to be converted into delicately carved pastel-colored crystal blossoms. This transformation involves changing organic flowers (daisies, delphiniums, poppies, etc.) into transparent or semi-transparent crystal versions with pastel hues. Each flower must retain its recognizable form but appear as if carved from crystal, with visible internal refractions and smooth edges. The conversion must avoid loss of fine details such as petal veins or stem textures, and ensure that colors are translucent rather than opaque.
-Sub requirement 3: Convert all floral elements into pastel-colored crystal blossoms, ensuring they maintain botanical structure, transparency, and internal light refraction without losing fine details or appearing solid/opaque.

-Thinking process 4: The entire composition is to be placed on a minimalist mirrored pedestal. This adds a new element below the vase and introduces reflections. The pedestal must be flat, clean, and reflective, with no visible seams or distortions. Reflections must be accurate and symmetrical, matching the shape and lighting of the vase and flowers. The addition of this element must not disrupt the balance or spatial logic of the scene.
-Sub requirement 4: Add a minimalist mirrored pedestal beneath the vase, ensuring it supports the object properly and produces realistic, undistorted reflections of the vase and crystal flowers.

-Thinking process 5: The background remains dark, but the introduction of crystal materials increases light interaction. The lighting must now include refractive highlights, internal glow, and subtle chromatic dispersion typical of crystal. The shadows and ambient light should adapt to the transparency and reflectivity of the new materials, avoiding flat or overly sharp lighting that contradicts the physical properties of crystal.
-Sub requirement 5: Adjust lighting to simulate crystal behavior—refraction, reflection, and soft internal glow—without creating unnatural glows or misplaced highlights.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the ceramic vase with a crystal version that maintains shape and proportions, evaluate whether the transformed vase retains the original silhouette, including the curved body, flared neck, and scrolled handles, without warping or misalignment. The crystal surface should have visible facets that follow the contours logically, and the material must appear transparent with no opaque patches or unnatural texture.
Question: Does the crystal vase maintain the original shape and proportions of the ceramic vase, with clear faceted surfaces that follow the curvature without geometric distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing painted panels with etched abstract floral patterns, assess whether the new patterns are integrated into the crystal surface with consistent line quality and depth, resembling real crystal engraving. The patterns should not appear as floating overlays or pixelated lines.
Question: Are the abstract floral patterns on the crystal vase etched into the surface with uniform depth and clarity, without appearing superimposed or blurred?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting flowers into pastel-colored crystal blossoms, examine whether each flower retains its botanical form (e.g., daisy petals, poppy shape) but appears translucent with internal refraction and soft pastel tones. The stems and leaves should also be rendered in crystal with appropriate translucency and fine detail.
Question: Do the crystal flowers retain the recognizable shapes of the original blooms and display internal refraction and pastel coloration without appearing solid or opaque?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a minimalist mirrored pedestal, check whether the pedestal is flat, clean, and reflective, and whether it supports the vase without visible gaps or instability. The reflection must accurately mirror the vase and flowers with proper symmetry and lighting consistency.
Question: Is the mirrored pedestal flat and reflective, showing a clear, undistorted reflection of the crystal vase and flowers?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adjusting lighting for crystal behavior, verify whether the lighting includes soft highlights, internal glow, and chromatic dispersion typical of crystal, particularly around edges and facets. Shadows should be softer and more diffused due to transparency, and there should be no harsh or unrealistic glows.
Question: Does the lighting show realistic refraction and internal glow in the crystal elements, with soft highlights and no unnatural bright spots or flat shading?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
