      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the feather into fiery, golden plumage with iridescent tips, evaluate whether the material and color transformation at the feather's main body (the large brown leather-like structure) maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original feather has a defined striped texture and shape; the edited version must preserve this geometric integrity while introducing new textures and colors without breaking the natural flow or introducing unnatural distortions.",
      "question": "Does the golden plumage retain the original feather’s elongated shape and striped pattern without visible warping or irregular edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding iridescent tips to the feather, assess whether the transition from golden plumage to iridescent ends is smooth and physically plausible. The original feather ends are tapered and consistent; any added iridescence must not introduce abrupt color shifts, pixelation, or unnatural glow artifacts that break the surface continuity.",
      "question": "Are the iridescent tips at the end of the feather smoothly blended with the golden plumage, showing no jagged edges or unnatural light leaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the beads into glowing ember-like orbs with swirling magma patterns, evaluate the replacement of the turquoise stones along the stem of the feather. These beads are positioned in a linear sequence near the base of the feather; the edited version must ensure each orb retains spherical form, proper size proportion relative to the feather, and avoids texture artifacts such as misaligned swirls or inconsistent glow.",
      "question": "Do the ember-like orbs maintain spherical shape and uniform size, with swirling magma patterns that appear continuous and natural without broken lines or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the metallic silver feather ornament with gleaming phoenix claws holding a radiant flame, assess the new element’s integration at the end of the feather where the original silver charm was attached. The claws must conform to anatomical plausibility (e.g., three-toed structure), be properly scaled relative to the feather, and the flame must emit a soft, ethereal glow without over-saturation or halo artifacts.",
      "question": "Are the phoenix claws correctly proportioned and shaped with natural joint angles, and does the flame they hold emit a soft, diffused glow without harsh outlines or unnatural brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of creating an aura of ancient magic and rebirth, evaluate the overall composition and lighting consistency between the edited elements and the wooden background. The original image features warm wood tones and natural lighting; the new magical elements must integrate seamlessly without casting unrealistic shadows, introducing floating highlights, or disrupting the depth perception.",
      "question": "Do the newly added magical elements (plumage, embers, claws, flame) cast shadows and reflect light consistently with the ambient lighting of the wooden surface, avoiding floating or disconnected appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
