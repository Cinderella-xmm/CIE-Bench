      "thinking_process": "Considering the need for the cross-section to show the natural texture of the apple's flesh, check if the generated texture matches the expected appearance of a real apple's interior and whether it integrates seamlessly with the outer skin.",
      "question": "Does the cross-section reveal a natural, detailed texture of the apple's flesh, avoiding any unnatural or overly smooth appearance?",

      "question": "Is the top view of the apple’s stem and calyx accurately represented with natural proportions and geometry, without any obvious distortions or artifacts?",

      "thinking_process": "Evaluating the consistency between the three views (front, cross-section, top), ensure that the overall structure of the apple remains cohesive and logical, avoiding inconsistencies in size, shape, or texture across different angles.",
      "question": "Are the shapes, sizes, and textures of the apple consistent across the front view, cross-section, and top view, ensuring structural coherence without any contradictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Assessing the overall integration of new elements (cross-section and top view) into the image, ensure that lighting and shadows are applied naturally, enhancing visual credibility and avoiding anomalies like inconsistent light sources or misplaced shadows.",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows in the cross-section and top view appear natural and consistent with those in the front view, contributing to a unified appearance?",
