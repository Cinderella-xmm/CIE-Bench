      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining geometric consistency and plausible optical effects in the glass orb, evaluate whether the curvature of the orb causes any distortion in the enclosed scene—such as stretched trees, warped water surface, or incorrect perspective shifts—especially near the edges of the orb where refraction should be most noticeable.",
      "question": "Are the trees, mountains, and water inside the glass orb correctly proportioned and undistorted despite the spherical enclosure, with no visible warping or bending of vertical lines?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that ducks are transformed into glossy 3D models, assess whether their shapes remain biologically accurate and whether the glossiness appears natural without over-saturation or unnatural highlights that suggest digital rendering artifacts.",
      "question": "Do the ducks retain their natural body shape and size relative to the water and rocks, with smooth, reflective surfaces that do not show exaggerated shine or unnatural specular highlights?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement for recreating water depth using resin and transparent textures, evaluate whether the underwater visibility of rocks remains clear and consistent with real water clarity, and whether layered textures introduce artificial patterns or repetition.",
      "question": "Is the water beneath the ducks transparent enough to clearly see the rocky bottom, with no visible layering artifacts, texture tiling, or unnatural opacity variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement for adding miniature woodland animal figurines, check if these small figures are placed realistically among rocks and foliage, with appropriate scale and grounding, and whether they appear to be part of the scene rather than floating or misplaced.",
      "question": "Are the miniature animal figurines positioned on solid surfaces (rocks or ground), properly scaled compared to surrounding elements, and free from floating or unnatural shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement for placing the orb on a natural wood base, assess whether the base has a realistic wood grain texture, proper shadow alignment with the orb, and stable contact with the surface, avoiding visual inconsistencies like floating or mismatched lighting.",
      "question": "Does the wood base have a natural grain pattern and cast a consistent shadow under the orb, indicating physical contact and realistic lighting interaction?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
