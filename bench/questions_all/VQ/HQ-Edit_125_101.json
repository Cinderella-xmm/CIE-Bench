      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the leaping dancer into a stylized 3D ballerina figure within a snow globe, evaluate whether the pose and proportions of the ballerina remain consistent with the original dancerâ€™s silhouette and physical structure. The editing involves converting a real human form into a miniature figurine, which risks distortion in limb length, joint angles, or anatomical plausibility. This affects structural coherence and visual credibility.",
      "question": "Does the 3D ballerina figure inside the snow globe maintain anatomically correct proportions and joint alignment, matching the original dancer's pose without exaggerated or broken limbs?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of encapsulating the scene within a classic bronze and glass base with French engravings, assess whether the materials (bronze, glass) appear physically plausible and consistent with real-world textures. The base must show appropriate reflections, metallic sheen, and engraved details that are sharp and non-artificial. This relates to material realism and absence of unnatural textures.",
      "question": "Does the base of the snow globe display realistic bronze texture with subtle reflective highlights and clearly defined engraved French script, without pixelation or synthetic-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of creating a snow globe effect with swirling snowflakes around the Eiffel Tower and Parisian landmarks, evaluate whether the snowflakes are uniformly distributed and dynamically positioned as if suspended in motion, avoiding clustering or unnatural spacing. The presence of artificial or repeating patterns in snowflakes would degrade perceptual quality.",
      "question": "Are the snowflakes inside the globe evenly dispersed and varied in shape and size, appearing to float naturally without repeating patterns or clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the Eiffel Tower and other Parisian landmarks inside the snow globe at a reduced scale, assess whether their relative sizes and spatial relationships are proportionally accurate and structurally coherent. Miniaturization should preserve architectural integrity and avoid distorted geometry such as warped towers or flattened structures.",
      "question": "Are the Eiffel Tower and surrounding Parisian landmarks scaled down appropriately and geometrically intact, maintaining correct perspective and structural details without warping or flattening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering the entire scene within a transparent glass sphere, evaluate whether the spherical surface shows proper refraction, distortion, and reflection effects consistent with a real glass dome. The edges should be smooth, and internal elements should appear slightly bent due to lensing, ensuring visual credibility.",
      "question": "Does the glass dome of the snow globe exhibit natural refraction and subtle bending of internal elements, with smooth curvature and no jagged edges or abrupt transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
