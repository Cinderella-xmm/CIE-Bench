      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the piano into a cookie sculpture with caramel and icing, this question evaluates whether the surface texture of the piano now appears as a cohesive edible material rather than a painted or digitally altered version. The original piano had a reflective, smooth black surface; the new material should show matte caramel tones with visible icing patterns and subtle gloss from sugar glaze. The focus is on texture authenticity and absence of artificial seams or inconsistent rendering.",
      "question": "Does the surface of the piano exhibit a uniform caramel color with visible white and gold icing details that resemble real edible decoration, without unnatural textures or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the piano’s shape and structure, this question checks whether the core geometry of the piano—such as the lid angle, leg positions, pedal placement, and keyboard alignment—remains accurate and undistorted after transformation. Any warping, misalignment, or disproportionate scaling would compromise structural coherence.",
      "question": "Are the proportions and spatial relationships of the piano’s components (lid, body, legs, pedals) preserved and correctly aligned, with no visible deformation or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the glossy black surface with caramel and icing, this question assesses whether the color and finish of the piano’s surface transition smoothly and realistically from the original dark tone to a warm caramel hue with appropriate shading and reflection. It checks for abrupt transitions, incorrect highlights, or loss of depth.",
      "question": "Is the color transition from black to caramel seamless, with soft gradients and natural light interaction that matches the lighting in the room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of embedding sugar crystals for the keys, this question examines whether the keys are rendered as small, translucent, crystalline structures resembling sugar, evenly spaced and aligned with the keyboard layout. It checks for detail fidelity and visual coherence within the context of the edible theme.",
      "question": "Do the keys appear as distinct, uniformly shaped sugar crystals arranged in a regular pattern along the keyboard, with no missing or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the piano on a white marble tabletop, this question evaluates whether the new base is properly integrated into the scene. It checks for correct material appearance (marble veining), proper scale relative to the piano, and consistent lighting and shadow interaction with the surrounding environment.",
      "question": "Is the white marble tabletop beneath the piano flat, properly scaled, and displaying natural stone patterns and shadows that align with the light source above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts during transformation, this question inspects high-detail areas such as edges, corners, and junctions between materials (e.g., where icing meets caramel, or where the piano meets the table). It looks for signs of blurring, jagged lines, or clipping artifacts that may indicate poor rendering.",
      "question": "Are all edges of the piano and its decorative elements sharp and clean, with no visible pixelation, smudging, or unnatural blending at boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of environmental integration, this question checks whether the lighting and shadows cast by the piano onto the marble table and surrounding area are consistent with the direction and intensity of the chandelier and ambient light in the hall. It ensures the edited object interacts realistically with the scene.",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the piano onto the marble table match the light direction from the chandelier and appear soft and naturally diffused?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
