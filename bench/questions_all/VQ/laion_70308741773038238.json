      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reshaping the car body into an elongated, streamlined vessel, this question evaluates whether the transformed body maintains smooth, continuous curves without abrupt angles or warped geometry. The original car’s rear and side profiles are key reference points for proportion and flow. Any distortion here would compromise structural consistency and visual credibility.",
      "question": "Does the elongated body retain smooth, continuous curvature along the side and rear panels without sharp edges or unnatural bulges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing wheels with buoyant, textured glass bases, this question checks if the new bases are physically plausible, properly scaled, and integrated into the scene. The original wheel positions are clearly visible; replacement should preserve their spatial relationship to the body while introducing transparency and texture consistent with glass.",
      "question": "Are the glass bases at the wheel positions transparent with visible internal texture, evenly shaped, and grounded flush with the platform without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a silver nautical-themed cap, this question assesses placement and material consistency. The cap should sit atop the former soft-top area, aligned with the car’s centerline and matching the metallic sheen of other components like the badge and trim.",
      "question": "Is the silver cap centered on the roof area, with clean edges and reflective surface that matches the surrounding chrome elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of embossing minimal Bentley branding along the sides using elegant serif typography, this question verifies that the text is readable, proportionally sized, and follows the contour of the body. It should not appear flat or disconnected from the surface.",
      "question": "Is the embossed text along the side panel clearly legible, aligned with the body's curvature, and rendered with subtle depth and shadow to match the material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating flowing sea wave patterns across the surface, this question evaluates whether the patterns follow natural fluid dynamics, blend seamlessly into the bodywork, and avoid repetitive or artificial tiling. The patterns should be visible but not overpowering, especially near the rear and side panels.",
      "question": "Do the wave patterns flow continuously across the surface without repeating tiles, jagged edges, or mismatched lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
