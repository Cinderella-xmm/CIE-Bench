Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the sailboat into a walnut wood sculpture, evaluate whether the sails have been carved from smooth, polished walnut with visible grain patterns. The original image shows large white sails made of fabric; the edited version must replace these with wood material while maintaining structural coherence and natural texture. This involves assessing if the material change preserves realistic surface details and avoids unnatural textures or loss of fine detail.
Question: Are the sails rendered as smooth, polished walnut with visible and consistent grain patterns that mimic real wood, without artificial sheen or texture repetition?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of shaping the hull with deeper, textured carvings to mimic original planks, assess whether the hull’s transformation maintains the original boat's structure but now features detailed wooden carving. The original hull is dark and appears to be made of wood planks; in the edited version, this should be enhanced with depth and texture resembling hand-carved walnut. Evaluate if the geometric shape remains intact and if the texture appears naturally layered and plausible.
Question: Does the hull display deep, textured carvings that resemble individual walnut planks with natural variations in thickness and spacing, preserving the original boat’s silhouette without distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of positioning the sculpture on a sleek, pale beige pedestal, evaluate whether a new element (the pedestal) has been added beneath the boat. The original image shows the boat floating on water; the edited version must include a pedestal that supports the sculpture without disrupting the composition. Check if the pedestal is proportionally correct, visually integrated, and does not introduce floating or misaligned elements.
Question: Is the boat positioned on a sleek, pale beige pedestal that is properly grounded and aligned with the boat’s base, without appearing to float or disconnect from the surface?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining natural wood tones and craftsmanship visibility, assess whether the overall color palette of the sculpture reflects authentic walnut hues—rich browns with subtle variations—and whether lighting interacts realistically with the material. The original image has warm sunset lighting; the edited version must ensure the wood reflects light consistently with real polished surfaces, avoiding flat or overly saturated colors.
Question: Do the wood tones across the sails and hull show natural variation in color and reflectivity under the ambient light, without uniformity or unnatural highlights?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility after transformation, evaluate whether the overall form of the boat remains geometrically coherent. The original boat has a defined keel, mast, and rigging; in the sculpted version, these elements must retain their original proportions and spatial relationships. Check for any warped lines, misplaced components, or missing parts due to editing.
Question: Are all structural elements such as the mast, rigging, and deck preserved in correct alignment and proportion relative to each other, without stretching, bending, or missing parts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
