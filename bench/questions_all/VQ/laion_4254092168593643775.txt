Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the motocross rider into a minimalist silhouette style, evaluate whether the silhouette maintains structural coherence with the original rider’s posture and proportions. The editing position is the rider’s body and motorcycle, which must retain anatomical accuracy and geometric consistency despite stylization. Check if limbs, joints, and bike components remain proportionally aligned and undistorted.
Question: Does the silhouette of the rider maintain correct limb proportions and joint alignment without unnatural elongation or compression?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding dynamic streaks of sand as background graphics, assess whether these streaks are integrated naturally with the motion blur of the scene. The editing position is the background behind the rider and motorcycle. Evaluate if the sand streaks follow the direction of movement and have consistent texture and opacity, avoiding abrupt edges or artificial patterns.
Question: Are the sand streaks in the background smoothly blended with the motion blur and do they follow the direction of travel without sharp, unnatural breaks?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of integrating bold typography with the brand name "RaceFuel," evaluate the placement and visual integration of text elements. The editing position is the central area of the image, likely overlapping the rider or background. Check if the typography overlaps cleanly without distorting underlying elements, and whether font style and color contrast create legibility without visual disruption.
Question: Is the "RaceFuel" text clearly legible and positioned without obscuring key parts of the rider or motorcycle, and does it blend cohesively with the overall design?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of overlaying a track outline decked in bright iconic colors, assess the placement and shape of the track graphic. The editing position is the upper-right corner of the image, where a circuit-like path is added. Evaluate whether the track follows a plausible layout, maintains consistent line thickness, and avoids intersecting or clipping with other elements improperly.
Question: Does the track outline in the upper-right corner form a continuous, closed loop without self-intersections or broken segments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a speedometer icon with a maxed-out needle at the bottom, evaluate the realism and integration of this element. The editing position is the lower portion of the image, near the ground. Check if the speedometer has a coherent shape, proper scale markings, and is sized appropriately relative to the motorcycle and rider, without appearing floating or misaligned.
Question: Is the speedometer icon positioned correctly at the bottom of the image with a clear, non-deformed dial and needle pointing to maximum speed?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
