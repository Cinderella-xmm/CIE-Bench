      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the two cylindrical towers into thick tree trunks with bark texture, this question evaluates whether the shape of each trunk maintains structural coherence with the original towerâ€™s height and diameter, and whether the bark texture appears natural and continuous without repeating patterns or artificial seams.",
      "question": "Do the two central tree trunks retain the original towers' vertical proportions and cylindrical form without unnatural tapering or distorted geometry?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the stone wall with branching structures, this question checks whether the transition from trunk to branch is physically plausible and avoids floating or disconnected limbs that violate spatial logic.",
      "question": "Are the branches extending from the trunks seamlessly connected and positioned in a way that follows natural growth patterns, without floating or misaligned segments?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the flag with glowing ethereal leaves, this question assesses whether the new element integrates naturally into the scene, particularly regarding light emission and motion suggestion, and whether it avoids harsh glows or unnatural transparency.",
      "question": "Do the glowing leaves at the top of the structure emit a soft, diffused green light that blends with ambient lighting and does not produce sharp halos or overexposed areas?",

      "question": "Are the root-like spirit figures embedded in the ground smoothly blended with the terrain and free of visible pixelation, edge artifacts, or unnatural translucency?",
