      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the jet ski with a shell-like body that maintains plausible proportions and surface texture, this question evaluates whether the new structure appears structurally coherent and physically rational within the scene. The shell should match the size and position of the original boat, with smooth curvature and no broken geometry or unnatural edges.",
      "question": "Does the shell-like body of the creature have consistent curvature and smooth surface transitions without visible cracks, misaligned segments, or distorted shapes?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding coral-like spires across the back of the creature, this question checks if the spires follow natural organic forms and are properly lit by the sunset. They should not appear flat, overly symmetrical, or disconnected from the main body.",
      "question": "Are the coral-like spires distributed organically along the back of the creature, with varying heights and irregular shapes that resemble natural coral formations?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the riders into glowing sea guardian spirits, this question assesses whether the glowing effect is localized to the figures and integrates naturally with the ambient light. The glow should not bleed into surrounding areas unnaturally or create floating light patches.",
      "question": "Do the glowing sea guardian spirits emit soft, diffused light that originates from their bodies and does not produce sharp halos or isolated bright spots outside their forms?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the water trail with luminescent wave patterns mimicking the skyâ€™s gradient, this question evaluates whether the new trail follows the direction and motion of the original wake and matches the color gradient of the sunset. It should not appear static or pixelated.",
      "question": "Does the luminescent wave pattern behind the creature flow smoothly in the same direction as the original wake, with colors transitioning gradually from warm orange to deep red matching the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of seamless integration with the environment, this question checks whether the edited creature casts appropriate shadows or reflections on the water and whether its lighting matches the directional sunset illumination. Any mismatch would indicate poor integration.",
      "question": "Does the creature cast a faint shadow on the water surface beneath it, and are its illuminated parts consistent with the direction of sunlight from the setting sun?",
