Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the sandcastle into a miniature 3D model enclosed in a spherical glass dome on a sculpted mahogany base. This involves replacing the original beach environment with a display setup, which significantly alters the scene’s context and scale. The original image shows a large, detailed sandcastle on a natural beach with ocean and sky background. The transformation must preserve the sandcastle's structural integrity while introducing new elements (dome, base, glitter, shells, plaque) that should appear physically plausible and visually cohesive. Key perceptual quality concerns include maintaining realistic material textures (e.g., glass transparency, wood grain), avoiding unnatural lighting or shadows from added objects, ensuring geometric consistency of the dome and base, and preserving fine details of the sandcastle without distortion.
-Sub requirement 1: Replace the beach environment with a spherical glass dome enclosing the sandcastle, ensuring the dome is transparent, smooth, and free of visual artifacts such as seams, distortions, or incorrect reflections.
-Sub requirement 2: Add a sculpted mahogany base beneath the dome, ensuring it has realistic wood texture, appropriate proportions relative to the sandcastle, and no geometric inconsistencies.
-Sub requirement 3: Apply fine glittering grains to emulate sandy texture across the sandcastle surface, checking whether this layering introduces unnatural sparkle patterns or obscures original fine details.
-Sub requirement 4: Incorporate tiny ornately detailed seashells around the castle within the dome, verifying their size, placement, and material appearance are consistent with real shells and do not appear pixelated or distorted.
-Sub requirement 5: Add a ceramic plaque with “Empire of the Shores” inscribed, ensuring legibility, material consistency (matte pearl finish), and proper integration into the base without casting unrealistic shadows or appearing floating.
-Sub requirement 6: Apply a soft matte pearl finish to all surfaces inside the dome, including the sandcastle and shells, ensuring uniformity and absence of unnatural sheen or glare.
-Sub requirement 7: Maintain structural coherence of the sandcastle itself—no parts should be broken, stretched, or misaligned due to the addition of the dome or other elements.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a spherical glass dome over the sandcastle, this question evaluates whether the dome appears physically coherent and free of artifacts such as jagged edges, incorrect refraction, or unnatural reflections. The dome must fully enclose the sandcastle without distorting its shape or creating visible seams.
Question: Is the spherical glass dome transparent and smooth, with no visible seams, distortions, or incorrect light refractions affecting the sandcastle inside?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing a sculpted mahogany base under the dome, this question checks if the base has realistic wood grain, appropriate thickness, and correct proportion relative to the sandcastle. It also ensures the base does not appear artificially flattened or warped.
Question: Does the mahogany base have a natural wood texture and consistent thickness, and is it properly scaled to support the dome and sandcastle without appearing distorted?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of applying glittering grains to emulate sandy texture, this question assesses whether the added glitter enhances realism or creates unnatural sparkle clusters, blurring, or loss of original detail on the sandcastle’s surface.
Question: Are the glittering grains evenly distributed and subtle enough to mimic sand texture without obscuring fine architectural details of the sandcastle?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of incorporating tiny ornately detailed seashells around the castle, this question evaluates whether the shells are realistically sized, shaped, and textured, and whether they are positioned naturally within the dome without appearing clipped, duplicated, or unnaturally sharp.
Question: Are the seashells around the sandcastle clearly defined, appropriately small in scale, and free from pixelation or unnatural edge artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a ceramic plaque with text, this question checks whether the plaque is legible, has a consistent matte pearl finish, and is anchored properly to the base without floating or casting inconsistent shadows.
Question: Is the ceramic plaque with “Empire of the Shores” inscribed clearly readable, properly attached to the base, and displaying a uniform matte pearl surface without glare or texture mismatch?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of applying a soft matte pearl finish to all internal surfaces, this question evaluates whether the overall surface treatment maintains a consistent, non-glossy appearance across the sandcastle and shells, avoiding shiny spots or uneven lighting.
Question: Is the matte pearl finish uniformly applied across the sandcastle and surrounding shells, with no areas showing excessive shine or reflection?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q7: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence of the sandcastle, this question checks whether any part of the original structure—such as towers, staircases, or arches—is deformed, broken, or misaligned due to the addition of the dome or base.
Question: Are all architectural elements of the sandcastle (towers, stairs, arches) intact and geometrically consistent, with no stretching, bending, or missing sections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
