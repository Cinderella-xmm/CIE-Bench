      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the figure into a semi-cartoon style while maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility, evaluate whether the facial features retain natural proportions and anatomical accuracy despite stylistic changes. The original image shows an elderly man with distinct facial wrinkles and soft skin texture; any stylization must preserve these characteristics without distorting geometry or introducing unnatural shapes.",
      "question": "Are the facial features proportionally consistent with human anatomy, and do they maintain natural contours without exaggerated or distorted lines?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of highlighting textile patterns with gold leaf accents, assess whether the added gold elements integrate seamlessly into the fabric’s existing design. The original robe has intricate floral embroidery; adding metallic accents should not disrupt the texture continuity or introduce unnatural sheen or clumping.",
      "question": "Do the gold leaf accents follow the existing pattern flow and appear integrated into the textile without unnatural highlights or floating textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to slightly enlarge the hands for emphasis, evaluate whether the hand enlargement preserves anatomical correctness, including finger count, joint alignment, and skin texture. The original image shows aged hands with visible veins and natural creases; enlarging them must not cause deformation or loss of detail.",
      "question": "Are the enlarged hands anatomically accurate with five fingers each, proper joint structure, and natural skin texture without stretching or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to frame each print with deep indigo borders and extend subtle hand-drawn floral outlines from the robe into the frame, assess whether the border integration is seamless and the floral extensions maintain continuity with the original robe patterns. The transition between robe and frame should avoid abrupt edges or mismatched line styles.",
      "question": "Do the floral outlines extend naturally from the robe into the indigo border without sudden breaks, inconsistent linework, or misaligned patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to create a semi-cartoon style without losing material authenticity, evaluate whether the overall rendering maintains plausible textures—especially in the robe’s fabric, which originally displays rich embroidery and satin-like sheen. Stylization should not degrade fine details such as threadwork or color gradients.",
      "question": "Do the textile materials retain visible texture variation and depth, avoiding flatness or pixelation that would suggest degraded quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
