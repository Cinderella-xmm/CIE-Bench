Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of enhancing the chandelier with ornate detailing, evaluate whether the added details maintain structural coherence and physical plausibility. The original chandelier is centrally located beneath the dome ceiling and features a crystal design with candle-like lights. Any enhancement must preserve its symmetrical geometry and material consistency (e.g., glass, metal) without introducing unnatural textures or distorted proportions.
Question: Does the enhanced chandelier retain its symmetrical structure and realistic crystal texture, with no visible distortion or irregularities in its shape or lighting reflections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding intricate patterns to the ceiling, assess whether these new patterns integrate naturally with the existing painted fresco and gold trim. The original ceiling has a circular central panel with floral motifs and gilded borders. Added patterns should not disrupt the radial symmetry or introduce inconsistent textures or color shifts.
Question: Are the newly added patterns on the ceiling consistent in style and scale with the existing decorative elements, and do they blend seamlessly without creating visual breaks or unnatural edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of simplifying the audience into silhouette figures, determine whether the silhouettes maintain plausible human forms and spatial density. The audience occupies multiple tiers of seating in the original image; converting them to silhouettes must preserve correct proportions, head-count alignment, and depth perception without flattening or distorting body shapes.
Question: Do the silhouette figures in the audience retain recognizable human postures and relative spacing, avoiding unnatural clustering or elongation that would compromise spatial logic?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of applying a sepia-toned color palette, evaluate whether the entire scene uniformly adopts this tone while preserving material distinctions (e.g., wood floor, black piano, golden trim). The transformation should not cause loss of fine detail or create unnatural color gradients across different materials.
Question: Is the sepia tone evenly applied across all surfaces, maintaining visible texture differences between materials such as the wooden floor, piano finish, and gilded ceiling, without introducing muddy or oversaturated areas?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of framing the grand piano as the central motif, assess whether the piano remains structurally intact and visually dominant. The piano is positioned center-stage on a polished wooden platform. Its shape, shadow, and reflection should remain consistent with real-world physics under the modified lighting conditions.
Question: Is the grand piano centered correctly on the stage with accurate perspective, intact legs, and natural shadowing that matches the light source from above, without any deformation or floating appearance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing “AN EVENING OF CLASSICAL MAJESTY” in elegant serif typography at the top, evaluate whether the text integrates naturally with the image’s composition. The placement must avoid overlapping key architectural elements (like the chandelier or ceiling fresco), and the font style must be legible and stylistically appropriate without pixelation or blurring.
Question: Is the text “AN EVENING OF CLASSICAL MAJESTY” clearly visible at the top of the image, properly aligned within the frame, and rendered with crisp edges and consistent stroke weight, without interfering with background details?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
