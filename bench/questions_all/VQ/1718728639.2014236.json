      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the metallic armor into shimmering tesserae with gold and azure patterns, this question evaluates whether the material change at the chest and torso area maintains structural coherence and avoids unnatural textures. The focus is on whether the mosaic tiles follow the contours of the armor without distortion, and if the lighting reflects consistently across the surface.",
      "question": "Do the tesserae on the chest and torso follow the original armorâ€™s curves without visible breaks, misalignments, or inconsistent tile sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of stylizing the wings with ornate feather motifs, this question checks whether the wing structure remains anatomically plausible and symmetrical after editing. The focus is on the left and right wings to ensure they mirror each other and maintain natural feather layering despite stylization.",
      "question": "Are the left and right wings symmetrically styled with ornate feathers, and do they maintain natural layering and curvature without unnatural bends or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the background with a celestial dome featuring a radiant light circle and iconographic borders, this question assesses whether the new background integrates naturally with the figure. The focus is on depth, lighting consistency, and absence of visible seams or clipping artifacts.",
      "question": "Does the celestial dome background appear to surround the figure without visible edges, color bleeding, or inconsistencies in lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the crown and neckpiece into mosaic style, this question evaluates whether the intricate patterns on these elements remain aligned with the original structure and maintain symmetry. The focus is on the central gem, the shape of the crown, and the connection to the neckpiece.",
      "question": "Are the mosaic patterns on the crown and neckpiece aligned with the original shape, symmetrically placed, and free of distorted or missing sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining a unified Byzantine mosaic style across all elements, this question checks whether the color and material consistency is preserved across the armor, wings, and crown. The focus is on whether gold and azure tones are uniformly applied and whether light interaction is consistent across surfaces.",
      "question": "Are the gold and azure colors used consistently across the armor, wings, and crown, with matching reflectivity and no abrupt transitions between materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
