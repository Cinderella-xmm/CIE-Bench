      "thinking_process": "Given the editing requirement to transform the skateboarder into a chibi cartoon character while maintaining the jump pose, we must assess if the character retains a structurally consistent and visually credible form. Evaluating the proportion and physical rationality, especially concerning the oversized head and cartoonified skateboard, is crucial.",
      "question": "Does the chibi character maintain proper structural consistency, with the head being slightly oversized yet naturally proportioned to the body?",

      "question": "Are the gray T-shirt and shorts of the chibi character accurately and naturally represented, without introducing any unnatural textures or color discrepancies?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The editing instruction requires the skateboard to be cartoonified. This involves checking if the modified skateboard retains its form and function while fitting seamlessly into the new artistic style and avoiding unnatural artifacts or distortions.",
      "question": "Does the cartoonified skateboard retain its visual plausibility with no unnatural textures or loss of fine details that would disrupt the scene’s authenticity?",

      "question": "Is the new hand-drawn city skyline background coherent and visually plausible, contributing positively to the overall scene without disrupting the main character’s prominence?",
