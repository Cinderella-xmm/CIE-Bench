      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the character into a chibi-style figure with an oversized head while preserving curly hair details, this question evaluates whether the proportional enlargement of the head results in distorted facial features such as stretched eyes, misaligned nose, or flattened cheekbones. It also checks if the curly hair retains its volume and strand definition despite the scale change.",
      "question": "Is the head proportionally enlarged without distorting facial features or flattening the curls of the hair?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying thick black outlines across the figure, this question assesses whether the outlines are consistently applied around the entire character without leaking into internal areas like the face or armor details, and whether they interfere with fine textures such as individual hair strands or engraved patterns on the armor.",
      "question": "Are the black outlines uniformly thick and cleanly separated from internal details such as hair, skin, and armor engravings?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the armor to have glossy enamel colors, this question examines whether the surface of the armor exhibits smooth, reflective highlights consistent with enamel material, and whether there are no visible texture artifacts, tiling, or matte patches that contradict the intended sheen.",
      "question": "Does the armor display consistent glossy reflections and smooth color transitions without pixelation or repeating patterns?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of retaining recognizable armor elements like shoulder pauldrons and chest plate designs, this question checks whether the simplified chibi version preserves the basic shapes and symmetry of these components, avoiding warped edges, broken joints, or missing segments that would compromise structural coherence.",
      "question": "Are the shoulder pauldrons and chest plate clearly defined with intact edges and symmetrical design, free from geometric distortions?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of attaching a small silver chain to the figure, this question evaluates whether the chain is properly connected at a logical point (e.g., top of the head or back), has realistic link shapes, and does not float or appear disconnected from the figure.",
      "question": "Is the silver chain attached at a coherent point and composed of uniformly shaped links that appear physically connected to the figure?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the figure on a dark velvet background, this question determines whether the background displays a soft, matte texture with subtle variations typical of velvet fabric, and whether it lacks harsh reflections or light inconsistencies that would suggest an artificial or mismatched surface.",
      "question": "Does the background exhibit a uniform dark texture with no bright reflections or unnatural gradients, consistent with velvet material?",
