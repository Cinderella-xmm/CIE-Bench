      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming spheres and cubes into LEGO bricks with marbled patterns while maintaining color, evaluate whether the shape transformation from spherical and cubic forms to LEGO brick geometry is structurally coherent and physically plausible. The original image contains smooth, reflective spheres and cubes in motion; the edited version must retain the marbled pattern but convert these into interlocking LEGO-like shapes without geometric distortion or unnatural deformation.",
      "question": "Are all spherical and cubic elements converted into LEGO brick shapes with consistent rectangular prismatic geometry, preserving structural integrity and avoiding warped or broken edges?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing surface texture to resemble LEGO's matte finish, assess whether the material appearance of the transformed objects has been altered from the original glossy, reflective marble-like surface to a non-reflective, matte texture typical of LEGO bricks. This change affects perceived realism and authenticity, especially when comparing to the original high-gloss surfaces.",
      "question": "Do the transformed LEGO bricks exhibit a uniform matte surface finish without specular highlights or reflections that contradict the intended LEGO material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding subtle interlocking details on bricks to enhance visual coherence, evaluate whether the LEGO bricks display visible interlocking features such as studs or grooves that are consistent with real LEGO construction. These details should be present on top faces and sides where appropriate, ensuring they align with the physical logic of modular building blocks.",
      "question": "Are there visible, proportionally accurate interlocking features (e.g., studs or recesses) on the tops and sides of the LEGO bricks that match standard LEGO design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of arranging elements in a structured pattern on a wooden shelf, assess whether the previously scattered and dynamic arrangement of spheres and cubes has been reorganized into an orderly, stable configuration on a flat wooden surface. The original image shows chaotic motion and floating fragments; the edit must replace this with a static, balanced layout that avoids floating or unsupported elements.",
      "question": "Are all LEGO bricks arranged in a stable, grounded formation on a wooden shelf surface, with no floating or suspended pieces that defy gravity or spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of simplifying the background for a clean, minimalist aesthetic, evaluate whether the background has been reduced in complexity and detail compared to the original imageâ€™s soft, textured blue-gray backdrop. The new background should not contain distracting elements and should support the focus on the LEGO structure without introducing artificial textures or inconsistencies.",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly simplified into a clean, neutral tone without any residual textures, shadows, or depth cues that conflict with the minimalist intent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
