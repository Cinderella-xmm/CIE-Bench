Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of converting the mouse into a 3D voxel-style model while maintaining overall realism and natural appearance, we need to assess if the texture and material of the new 3D model resemble the original mouse's fur texture without introducing unnatural artifacts.
Question: Does the 3D voxel-style model of the mouse retain a natural texture similar to the original mouse's fur without any obvious unnatural artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility after converting the mouse into a 3D voxel-style model, we need to evaluate if the proportions and physical rationality of the mouse's body parts remain consistent with its original form.
Question: Are the proportions and physical rationality of the mouse's body parts in the 3D voxel-style model consistent with its original form, avoiding any distortion or deformation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement of maintaining a natural appearance and avoiding unnatural textures during the conversion to a 3D voxel-style model, we need to check if the edges and surfaces of the 3D model appear smooth and coherent.
Question: Do the edges and surfaces of the 3D voxel-style mouse model appear smooth and coherent, without any jagged or broken geometric shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of preserving the overall authenticity and natural appearance, we need to verify if the interaction between the 3D voxel-style mouse model and the smartphone looks plausible and realistic.
Question: Does the interaction between the 3D voxel-style mouse model and the smartphone look plausible and realistic, without any unnatural positioning or shadows?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of avoiding the introduction of artifacts and loss of details, we need to examine if the fine details of the mouse's features, like whiskers and eyes, are preserved in the 3D voxel-style model.
Question: Are the fine details of the mouse's features, such as whiskers and eyes, preserved in the 3D voxel-style model without any loss or degradation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
