Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction specifies creating a gymnastics-themed art postcard with a contortionist's silhouette featuring a brushstroke effect. This involves stylizing the figure’s form, particularly emphasizing dynamic proportions and artistic texture. The original image shows a gymnast performing a handstand on the balance beam, with realistic anatomy and lighting. The brushstroke effect will likely alter the surface texture of the figure, so attention must be paid to whether this modification preserves structural coherence while introducing artistic style without distorting anatomy or material appearance.
-Sub requirement 1: Apply a brushstroke effect across the entire figure (especially silhouette), evaluating whether the texture change maintains visual credibility and does not introduce unnatural distortions in shape or proportion.

-Thinking process 2: The instruction requires enlarging the hands to emphasize grip strength. In the original image, the hands are anatomically correct and positioned naturally on the beam. Enlarging them may affect ergonomic plausibility and spatial consistency with the rest of the body. This change could lead to disproportionate scaling, altering the perceived realism of the gesture.
-Sub requirement 2: Enlarge the hands at the point of contact with the balance beam, assessing whether the size increase is consistent with physical logic and whether the hand shape remains anatomically plausible.

-Thinking process 3: Elongating the legs for dynamic proportions alters the natural human form. In the original image, the legs are bent in a backbend pose, forming a smooth arc. Exaggerated elongation might break geometric continuity or create unnatural gaps between limbs and torso, affecting structural integrity.
-Sub requirement 3: Modify leg length to achieve dynamic proportions, checking whether the elongation preserves continuous curvature and avoids abrupt breaks or unnatural angles in the limbs.

-Thinking process 4: Use gradients of blue and silver to accentuate form. The original leotard has a metallic sheen with reflective properties. Introducing gradient effects should enhance depth but must not disrupt material realism or cause color bleeding into non-target areas.
-Sub requirement 4: Apply blue and silver gradients to the leotard and skin tones, ensuring that color transitions are smooth and do not result in artificial halos, color fringes, or loss of texture detail.

-Thinking process 5: Include action motifs such as swirling ribbons and stars. These elements are not present in the original image and will be added to the background or around the figure. Their integration must respect composition and perspective, avoiding floating or misaligned elements that reduce visual credibility.
-Sub requirement 5: Add swirling ribbons and star motifs near the figure, verifying their placement aligns with motion direction and depth cues, and that they do not overlap incorrectly with the body or beam.

-Thinking process 6: Mount the final image on matt-finish panels with corner-rounded edges. This implies a frame-like border around the artwork. The addition of such a frame must not obscure key parts of the image or introduce inconsistent lighting or shadows.
-Sub requirement 6: Add rounded-corner matt-finish panel framing, confirming that the border is uniformly applied, visually consistent with display standards, and does not interfere with the central subject.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of applying a brushstroke effect across the figure’s silhouette to create an artistic style, this question evaluates whether the texture modification maintains the overall form without distorting anatomical features such as limbs, joints, or facial structure. The brushstroke should enhance visual appeal without breaking continuity or causing visible artifacts like smearing or pixelation.
Question: Does the brushstroke effect cover the figure evenly without disrupting the outline of limbs, head, or torso?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of enlarging the hands to emphasize grip strength, this question checks whether the increased size of the hands adheres to anatomical plausibility and proportional balance with the rest of the body. The number of fingers must remain five, and the shape should reflect natural hand morphology under stress.
Question: Are the enlarged hands anatomically accurate with five fingers each, and do they maintain natural joint alignment and skin texture?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of elongating the legs for dynamic proportions, this question assesses whether the extension of the legs preserves smooth curvature and continuous flow from hip to foot, avoiding sharp kinks or unnatural gaps that would suggest geometric distortion.
Question: Do the elongated legs form a continuous, curved line from the hips to the feet without abrupt bends or discontinuities?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using blue and silver gradients to accentuate form, this question evaluates whether the color transitions on the leotard and skin appear smooth and physically plausible, without harsh edges, color bleed, or loss of reflective qualities that define the original material.
Question: Are the blue and silver gradients smoothly blended across the leotard and skin, without visible banding or unnatural highlights?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding swirling ribbons and stars as action motifs, this question verifies whether these elements are positioned in a way that suggests motion consistent with the gymnast’s pose, and whether they are properly integrated into the scene without overlapping the body or beam unnaturally.
Question: Are the swirling ribbons and stars placed around the figure in a manner that follows the direction of movement and does not intersect with the body or balance beam?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of mounting the image on a matt-finish panel with rounded corners, this question checks whether the frame is consistently applied around the image, with no clipping of content, and whether the finish appears uniform and free of glare or shadow inconsistencies.
Question: Is the matt-finish panel with rounded corners fully visible around the image, without cutting off any part of the gymnast or background?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
