      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the seated figure into a chibi-style figurine, this involves significant style conversion from realistic to stylized. The original image features a detailed historical figure with natural proportions and textures. The editing must maintain structural coherence while introducing exaggerated proportions typical of chibi art (e.g., large head, small body). This transformation affects overall realism and visual credibility. The focus is on whether the transition preserves anatomical plausibility and avoids distorted geometric shapes.",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine retain proportionally consistent limbs and head size relative to the body, avoiding unnatural elongation or compression?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies emphasizing the tricorne hat as a key feature in the chibi version. In the original image, the hat has clear texture, shape, and material properties (black fabric with gold trim). After transformation, the hat must remain visually coherent with the new stylized form. The question evaluates whether the hat maintains its recognizable structure and material appearance without artifacts such as smudging, texture repetition, or incorrect lighting.",
      "question": "Is the tricorne hat's shape preserved with clean edges and consistent material texture, free from distortions or unnatural shading?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The edited image must include a miniature treasure chest held by the figurine, with exaggerated sparkling gold coins spilling out. The original image shows real gold coins in a natural setting, so the addition of a treasure chest introduces a new object that must be integrated seamlessly. The evaluation focuses on whether the chest and coins appear physically plausible in scale, material, and interaction with light, avoiding floating elements or mismatched shadows.",
      "question": "Are the miniature treasure chest and spilled gold coins positioned with proper perspective and shadow alignment, ensuring they appear grounded and integrated into the scene?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The figurine is to be placed on a stylized wooden pirate ship deck adorned with tiny daggers and nautical motifs. The original background is natural foliage, so replacing it with a constructed maritime surface requires careful rendering of wood grain, object placement, and scale consistency. The question checks for structural coherenceâ€”whether the deck appears solid and logically arranged, with objects like daggers not floating or misaligned.",
      "question": "Do the tiny daggers and nautical motifs on the wooden deck appear fixed in place with consistent scale and orientation, avoiding floating or misaligned elements?",

      "thinking_process": "The hands of the figurine are critical for interaction with the treasure chest. In the original image, the hands are realistically rendered with five fingers, natural skin texture, and correct joint articulation. In chibi style, hand proportions may be simplified, but they must still follow ergonomic principles. The question evaluates whether the number of fingers remains within five, joints are correctly formed, and textures are natural without pixelation or distortion.",
      "question": "Do the hands of the figurine have no more than five fingers, with naturally shaped knuckles and skin texture, and do they maintain proper grip on the treasure chest?",
