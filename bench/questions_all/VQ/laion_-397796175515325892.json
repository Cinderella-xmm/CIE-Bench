      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence during semi-cartoon stylization, particularly in architectural geometry, this question evaluates whether the spire and rooflines retain intact, non-distorted forms. The original image shows a clearly defined pointed spire and sloped red roofs—any warping or jagged edges in these areas would indicate a failure in geometric fidelity.",
      "question": "Are the edges of the church’s spire and rooflines smooth and continuous without jagged breaks or warped segments?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enhanced symmetry, this question checks if the left and right sides of the church facade are symmetrically aligned in the edited version. The original structure has some asymmetry (e.g., placement of side windows and towers), so forced symmetry could create unnatural duplication or misaligned features.",
      "question": "Do the left and right halves of the church’s façade mirror each other exactly, causing any misalignment in window positions or wall contours?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding metallic gold accents to spires, this question assesses whether the gold material appears integrated with the surface without floating highlights, unnatural sheen, or texture mismatches. The spire is the primary target for this effect, and its original stone-like texture must be preserved beneath the accent.",
      "question": "Does the metallic gold accent on the spire have a uniform, reflective appearance without clashing textures or unnatural glow spots?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adjusting proportion for grandeur, this question examines whether the height of the spire relative to the base of the church remains physically plausible. Excessive elongation could make the structure look unstable or cartoonish.",
      "question": "Is the height of the spire proportionally balanced with the width and height of the church’s main body, avoiding extreme vertical stretching?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating celestial-themed backgrounds, this question evaluates whether the sky behind the church transitions naturally with the building’s silhouette. A sudden shift in color or texture, or floating stars/planets, could break visual continuity.",
      "question": "Does the celestial background blend seamlessly with the top edge of the church and surrounding sky, without abrupt color shifts or floating objects?",

Loss of detail would reduce perceived authenticity.",

The frame should not obscure content or introduce distortion.",
