Q4: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement of avoiding the introduction of artifacts such as unnatural textures and loss of details, we need to confirm that the fine details of the calendar pages, such as text and grid lines, remain sharp and well-defined. This involves inspecting the edges and clarity of these details.
Question: Are the text and grid lines on the calendar pages sharp and well-defined without any loss of detail?
Choices: Yes, No
