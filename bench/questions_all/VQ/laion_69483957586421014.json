      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding a sleek box with metallic silver and matte black to match the appliance\", evaluate whether the packaging design maintains structural coherence with the original food processor. The box must be proportionally accurate and geometrically consistent with the appliance's dimensions, particularly around the base and handle areas, to avoid unnatural scaling or misalignment.",
      "question": "Does the packaging box maintain correct proportions relative to the food processor, especially in alignment with the base and handle, without any distorted edges or warped geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"featuring bold and modern typography with the brand name 'Waring' prominently displayed\", assess whether the text placement and style are consistent with high-end product packaging. The font should be sharp, legible, and integrated naturally into the design without overlapping or clipping onto other elements like the image of the appliance.",
      "question": "Is the 'Waring' brand name clearly visible and properly aligned on the packaging without overlapping or distorting adjacent elements such as the appliance illustration or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"illustrating the processor from an isometric angle on the box\", determine if the rendered image of the appliance on the packaging matches the original objectâ€™s shape, perspective, and details. The isometric view must preserve the correct angles of the lid, feed tube, and base, avoiding skewed or stretched components.",
      "question": "Does the isometric illustration of the food processor on the box accurately reflect the original object's geometry, including the feed tube, lid, and base, without distortion or incorrect angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding exploded view graphics of its components to convey functionality\", evaluate whether the exploded parts (such as the bowl, blade, lid, and feed chute) are correctly separated but still recognizable and spatially plausible. Each component should retain its original shape and material appearance without deformation or loss of detail.",
      "question": "Are the exploded components of the food processor depicted with accurate shapes and positions, maintaining their original form and material texture without stretching or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"designing a sleek box with metallic silver and matte black materials\", assess whether the surface textures of the packaging reflect realistic material properties. Metallic silver should show subtle reflections and gradients, while matte black should lack shine or glossiness, ensuring no artificial or pixelated textures appear.",
      "question": "Do the metallic silver and matte black surfaces of the packaging display natural material finishes without unnatural reflections, graininess, or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
