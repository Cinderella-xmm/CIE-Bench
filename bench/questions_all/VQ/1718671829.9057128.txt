Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the wooden cabin and moonlit landscape into an Art Deco poster, which involves significant stylization. This includes flattening structural lines into geometric shapes, stylizing the moon as a radiant circle, converting plants into symmetric patterns, applying metallic tones with gold and silver accents, and adding stylized clouds and window details with bold dynamics. These changes affect multiple elements in the image: the wooden structure of the cabin (especially the roof, beams, and porch), the moon in the sky, vegetation in the foreground and background, the window details, and the overall composition. Each of these elements must be evaluated for perceptual quality in terms of realism, naturalness, artifact presence, structural coherence, and visual plausibility under the new stylized aesthetic.

-Sub requirement 1: Flattening the structural lines of the wooden cabin into geometric shapes—evaluate whether this transformation preserves structural coherence and avoids distorted or broken geometric forms that compromise visual credibility.

-Sub requirement 2: Stylizing the moon as a radiant circle—assess whether the moon retains a plausible circular shape and radiance without unnatural texture or deformation, and whether its position relative to the horizon and surrounding landscape remains consistent.

-Sub requirement 3: Converting plants into symmetric patterns—determine if the vegetation (in the foreground and background) has been transformed into symmetrical, repeating motifs without losing identifiable plant forms or introducing artifacts such as jagged edges or unnatural spacing.

-Sub requirement 4: Applying metallic tones with gold and silver accents across the cabin and landscape—check whether the materials appear coherent with their original textures (e.g., wood, glass) and whether the metallic finish is applied uniformly without causing unnatural reflections, color bleeding, or loss of fine detail.

-Sub requirement 5: Adding stylized clouds and bold dynamic window details—evaluate whether the added clouds maintain a plausible form and integration with the sky, and whether the window details (such as frames and curtains) are enhanced with dynamic lines without distorting proportions or creating visual inconsistencies.

-Sub requirement 6: Ensuring overall composition maintains visual balance and structural consistency—verify that the flattened geometry, symmetric patterns, and stylized elements do not disrupt spatial relationships (e.g., perspective, depth) or introduce floating or misaligned components.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of flattening the structural lines of the wooden cabin into geometric shapes, evaluate whether the beams, roof overhang, and support columns have been transformed into clean, flat geometric forms without visible distortion, broken edges, or inconsistent angles that would suggest structural incoherence.
Question: Are the wooden beams and roof supports rendered as consistent geometric shapes with sharp, clean edges and no warped or fractured sections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of stylizing the moon as a radiant circle, assess whether the moon appears as a perfectly circular object with a smooth surface and evenly distributed radiance, without pixelation, irregular contours, or mismatched lighting effects that could imply digital artifacts.
Question: Is the moon a perfectly round shape with a smooth surface and uniform glow around its edge, without jagged outlines or uneven brightness?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting plants into symmetric patterns, determine whether the foliage in the foreground and along the hillside has been replaced with repeating, balanced geometric designs that maintain visual harmony and avoid unnatural gaps, overlapping, or misaligned segments.
Question: Are the plants in the foreground and background arranged in symmetrical, repeating patterns without irregular spacing or fragmented shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of applying metallic tones with gold and silver accents, evaluate whether the surfaces of the cabin’s wood and glass reflect metallic finishes consistently, with appropriate highlights and shadows that match the light source, and without unnatural color shifts or loss of texture detail.
Question: Do the wooden surfaces and glass panes display metallic gold and silver accents with consistent sheen and reflection, without color bleeding or missing texture details?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding stylized clouds and bold dynamic window details, check whether the newly introduced cloud forms follow a cohesive design language with clean lines and proper integration into the sky, and whether the window frame and curtain details feature dynamic, stylized lines without distorting the original proportions or introducing floating elements.
Question: Are the stylized clouds positioned above the horizon with smooth, flowing outlines and do the window frames show bold, angular lines that align with the architectural style without breaking the window’s structural integrity?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
