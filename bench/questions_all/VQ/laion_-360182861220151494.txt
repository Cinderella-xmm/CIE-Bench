Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of modifying the character's facial expression in Panel 1 to show a determined emotion with intense eyes gripping the katana, this involves editing the facial features and hand positioning. The original image shows the character with a calm smile and relaxed grip; therefore, altering her expression and hand pose must preserve anatomical accuracy and natural lighting. This requires checking whether the eyes appear strained or focused without distortion, and whether the fingers are correctly positioned around the hilt without unnatural bending or missing digits.
Question: Are the character’s eyes in Panel 1 clearly narrowed and intense, with visible tension in the eyelids and pupils, and is the hand gripping the katana properly aligned with five distinct fingers showing natural curvature?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of depicting dynamic motion in Panel 2 with fiery trails emanating from the character’s hair during a leap forward, this action involves adding motion effects and adjusting body posture. The original image shows the character in a static stance; thus, the leap must maintain proportional limbs and realistic physics. The fire trails must follow the direction of movement and not intersect incorrectly with the body or background elements.
Question: Does the character’s leaping pose in Panel 2 show correct leg extension and arm positioning consistent with forward momentum, and do the fiery trails originate naturally from the hair strands without overlapping into solid parts of the body?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of rendering the character standing triumphantly in Panel 3 with the katana pointing forward and colorful energy swirling around, this involves repositioning the sword and adding energy effects. The original image shows the sword held horizontally; changing its orientation must preserve structural integrity and avoid clipping between the blade and clothing. Energy swirls must be smooth and not interfere with the character’s silhouette or create jagged edges.
Question: Is the katana in Panel 3 correctly oriented forward without clipping through the character’s uniform or distorting the sleeve, and are the surrounding energy swirls continuous and free of pixelated or broken lines?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining vivid, contrasting backgrounds across all panels while preserving bold outlines for action emphasis, this involves color grading and line art enhancement. The original image has vibrant gradients and clear outlines; thus, any panel division or background adjustment must not blur or soften these elements. Background colors should remain saturated and spatially coherent without bleeding into foreground objects.
Question: Do the backgrounds in all three panels retain their original vibrancy and contrast without color bleed into the character’s outline or loss of sharpness in the bold borders around her figure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility when converting the single image into a three-panel manga layout with specific aspect ratios (3:4), this involves dividing the composition into distinct panels while preserving proportions and alignment. The character’s placement in each panel must align with the original proportions, especially in facial features, limbs, and weapon details. Any resizing or cropping must not introduce scaling artifacts or misalignment.
Question: Are the character’s head, torso, and limbs proportionally consistent across all three panels, with no stretching or compression that alters the original anatomy or causes misalignment between body parts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
