Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility while adding a circular anime-inspired badge, we need to assess if the badge blends naturally with the existing elements and does not introduce any unnatural textures or distortions.
Question: Does the circular badge appear seamlessly integrated into the scene without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement emphasizes avoiding distortions such as unnatural textures and loss of details. We need to ensure that the hand holding the badge looks realistic and maintains the natural appearance of human anatomy.
Question: Are the fingers of the hand holding the badge correctly shaped and detailed, without any unnatural deformations?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: To maintain the overall authenticity and natural appearance, the badge should incorporate the distinctive features of the landmarks accurately and proportionally. We need to verify if these features are represented correctly.
Question: Do the features of the Statue of Liberty, Eiffel Tower, and London Eye on the badge retain their recognizable shapes and proportions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement focuses on ensuring the retained core elements ensure structural consistency and visual credibility. The badge should not disrupt the structural integrity of the surrounding environment.
Question: Does the addition of the badge preserve the structural consistency of the surrounding landmarks, without causing any visual disruptions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement highlights the importance of avoiding unnatural textures and loss of details. The tassels added as a design element should look natural and enhance the visual appeal without introducing any artifacts.
Question: Are the tassels on the badge depicted with natural textures and details, contributing to the overall visual quality?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
