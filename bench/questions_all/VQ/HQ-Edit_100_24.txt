Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the subject into a Qing Dynasty traditional portrait, which involves significant changes to clothing, hairstyle, jewelry, and background. The original image shows a woman wearing a modern-style red embroidered qipao with a dragon motif, long straight black hair, and a neutral studio background. The key elements to be edited include replacing the current attire with an elaborately embroidered silk robe featuring dragon patterns (possibly more historically accurate), adding opulent jade jewelry, extending the hairstyle into an ornate headpiece with jade hairpins, and changing the background to an elegant study with Chinese scrolls in rich reds, golds, and deep greens. These changes involve complex additions and modifications that can affect realism, texture fidelity, structural coherence, and material consistency.

-Sub requirement 1: Replace the existing qipao with a Qing Dynasty-style silk robe featuring dragon embroidery—evaluate whether the new garment maintains natural fabric folds, consistent texture, plausible stitching, and proportionate scale relative to the body.

-Sub requirement 2: Add opulent jade jewelry (e.g., necklaces, earrings, bracelets)—assess whether the materials appear translucent, polished, and physically plausible, with realistic reflections and shadows, and whether they integrate naturally with the skin and clothing.

-Sub requirement 3: Transform the long straight hair into an ornate Qing Dynasty headpiece with intricate jade hairpins—check if the hairstyle maintains anatomical plausibility, proper volume distribution, and seamless integration of hairpins without floating or clipping artifacts.

-Sub requirement 4: Modify the background from a plain gray studio to an elegant study with classical Chinese scrolls—determine whether the new background has coherent depth, lighting consistency with the foreground, and appropriate color palette (reds, golds, deep greens) without mismatched tones or unnatural gradients.

-Sub requirement 5: Ensure all added elements (clothing, jewelry, hairpiece, background) maintain structural consistency and visual credibility—verify that no distortions occur in proportions, geometry, or spatial relationships, especially around joints, limbs, and facial features.

-Sub requirement 6: Evaluate fine details such as embroidery threads, jade surface textures, and scroll patterns—confirm that these are sharp, non-blurry, and free from pixelation or artifacting.

-Sub requirement 7: Assess hand positioning and anatomy—ensure fingers are correctly formed (no extra digits), hands rest naturally on the lap or robe, and skin texture is uniform and unbroken.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the current qipao with a Qing Dynasty-style silk robe featuring dragon embroidery, this involves modifying the garment’s design, texture, and fit. The original qipao already has a dragon pattern, so the edit must preserve or enhance this while ensuring the fabric drapes realistically and the embroidery appears detailed and continuous without distortion.
Question: Does the robe's fabric show natural folds and creases consistent with silk material, and are the dragon and floral embroidery patterns continuous and free from jagged edges or missing stitches?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding opulent jade jewelry, the focus is on the material properties of jade—translucency, smoothness, reflection—and how it interacts with light and surrounding elements. The jewelry should not appear flat, overly shiny, or disconnected from the body.
Question: Do the jade accessories (such as necklace or earrings) display realistic translucency, soft highlights, and subtle internal refraction, and are they properly attached to the body without floating or clipping through skin or clothing?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the hairstyle into an ornate Qing Dynasty headpiece with jade hairpins, the edit involves restructuring the hair and adding rigid objects. This risks geometric distortion or unnatural attachment points. The hair must retain volume and flow, and hairpins must be securely placed without appearing to float or penetrate the scalp improperly.
Question: Is the extended hairstyle anatomically plausible with natural volume and flow, and do the jade hairpins sit securely within the hair without floating, intersecting, or causing unnatural bulges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of changing the background to an elegant study with classical Chinese scrolls, the edit involves replacing a plain studio backdrop. The new background must match the lighting direction and color tone of the subject, avoid harsh transitions, and contain legible scroll details.
Question: Does the background feature clearly visible classical Chinese scrolls with consistent lighting, depth, and color harmony (rich reds, golds, deep greens), and does it blend seamlessly with the subject without abrupt edges or mismatched shadows?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency and avoiding distortions, particularly around the hands, the focus is on anatomical accuracy. The original image shows both hands resting near the waist. The edit must preserve five fingers per hand, correct finger proportions, and natural joint curvature.
Question: Are both hands fully visible with exactly five fingers each, natural finger spacing and curvature, and no signs of fusion, extra digits, or unnatural bending?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving fine details in embroidery, jade surfaces, and scroll patterns, the evaluation focuses on texture clarity and absence of digital artifacts such as blurring, noise, or pixelation. High-frequency details like threadwork and jade grain should remain sharp.
Question: Are the embroidery threads, jade surface textures, and scroll calligraphy sharp and clear, without visible pixelation, smudging, or artificial edge enhancement?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
