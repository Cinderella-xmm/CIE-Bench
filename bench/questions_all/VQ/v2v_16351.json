The background lockers and their colors should be replaced with elements fitting a showroom setting.",
      "question": "Are the lockers in the background seamlessly replaced with mid-century modern showroom elements without visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",

      "question": "Does the luxurious piece of designer furniture appear proportionally correct and physically plausible in place of the jersey display?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "To maintain the overall authenticity and natural appearance, the characters' interactions and gestures should remain consistent with the new setting. The man in the suit appears to be gesturing towards the jersey; this gesture should logically correspond to the new furniture.",
      "question": "Do the characters' gestures and body language remain natural and consistent with the new showroom setting and the luxurious furniture?",

      "question": "Is the lighting and shadow in the showroom consistent with the new setting, without introducing any unnatural or inconsistent effects?",

      "thinking_process": "The sub requirement emphasizes retaining the core elements while ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility. The characters and their clothing should remain unchanged apart from the background and the jersey display.",
