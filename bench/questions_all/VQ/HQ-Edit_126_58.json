      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the ice swan into a high-end winter fragrance bottle, with the wings converted into frosted glass accents, this editing involves material and structural transformation. The original image shows the swan made of translucent ice with defined feather-like textures. The conversion to frosted glass requires assessing whether the new material maintains visual coherence with the original form, including texture consistency and light interaction. This evaluation focuses on whether the frosted glass appearance is natural, free from unnatural texture artifacts or inconsistent transparency.",
      "question": "Do the wing areas of the swan exhibit a consistent frosted glass texture that matches the lighting and translucency of the original ice material without visible seams or unnatural surface distortions?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the neck into a sleek glass stopper, the original swan's neck is curved and smooth with a gradient from dark to light along its length. Transforming it into a glass stopper involves changing both shape and material. The edited version must preserve structural continuity—such as maintaining a logical tapering shape—and avoid geometric distortions like sharp edges or disproportionate scaling. This evaluates whether the neck-to-stopper transition appears physically plausible and integrates naturally with the rest of the bottle.",
      "question": "Is the neck of the swan transformed into a glass stopper with a smooth, tapered shape that maintains proportional alignment with the body and does not exhibit unnatural bending, jagged edges, or volume inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating red, pink, and green decorative elements as part of the bottle’s design, these elements are positioned around the base of the swan in the original image (e.g., pine branches and pink flowers). The editing task involves integrating them into the fragrance bottle’s structure. This requires checking whether the added decorations are seamlessly blended into the design, preserving their natural appearance and avoiding floating or misaligned placement. The focus is on spatial coherence and material integration.",
      "question": "Are the red, pink, and green decorative elements (such as pine branches and flowers) integrated into the base of the bottle in a way that avoids floating or disconnected positioning, and do they maintain natural color and texture without blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding an iridescent logo and naming the fragrance \"Winter Glow\" with a festive font style on the packaging label, this involves introducing text and reflective elements onto the bottle surface. The original image has no text or labels, so this addition must be evaluated for visual plausibility—specifically, whether the text appears properly scaled, legible, and aligned with the curvature of the bottle, and whether the iridescence effect is smoothly rendered without artificial glares or color bleeding.",
      "question": "Is the \"Winter Glow\" text clearly visible, properly aligned with the bottle's curvature, and does the iridescent effect appear smooth and continuous without unnatural color fringes or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining overall structural coherence and visual credibility when converting the swan into a fragrance bottle, the entire object must retain a unified form where all components (body, neck, wings, base) logically connect. The original swan has a balanced silhouette; any transformation must preserve this balance. This includes evaluating whether the proportions between the bottle body, stopper, and decorative elements follow physical logic and avoid distortions such as stretched features or mismatched scales.",
      "question": "Does the overall shape of the transformed swan-bottle maintain structural coherence, with all parts proportionally aligned and without visible warping, stretching, or disjointed sections that break the continuity of the form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
