      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the curved metallic sections into tentacle-like appendages, this involves reshaping the existing flowing balconies and walls. The key concern is whether the new form retains physical plausibility—such as maintaining continuous curvature and avoiding abrupt kinks or impossible bends that break the original architectural flow. The edit should not result in disjointed segments or unnatural bulges that contradict the building’s original volumetric structure.",
      "question": "Are the tentacle-like extensions smoothly integrated into the original curves of the facade without sudden angular breaks or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding fibrous textures across sections, this applies to the metallic surfaces between windows and along the undulating planes. Fibrous textures should mimic natural organic materials like muscle or plant fibers. If the texture appears repetitive, aliased, or unnaturally aligned with grid patterns, it undermines authenticity. The texture must follow the surface contour and avoid sharp edges or blocky patches.",
      "question": "Do the fibrous textures follow the curvature of the facade and appear continuous without repeating patterns or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing window surfaces with translucent, membrane-like panels, this affects the glass areas where reflections and interior views are visible. The new membrane should allow partial visibility while appearing thin and flexible, like biological tissue. If the replacement introduces hard edges, opacity mismatches, or ghosting around the frame, it suggests poor integration. The transition from original glass to membrane should be seamless.",
      "question": "Are the window areas replaced with translucent membranes that maintain soft light transmission and lack sharp borders or visible seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying iridescent, scale-like patterning to the metal, this involves overlaying a detailed texture over the reflective surface. The scales must conform to the complex curves of the facade and reflect light naturally. If the scales appear flat, misaligned, or have unnatural color gradients, it indicates a loss of depth and realism. The pattern should not obscure the underlying architecture or create visual noise.",
      "question": "Do the iridescent scale patterns align with the surface curvature and display smooth color transitions without flat or distorted regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating bio-luminescent lines along edges, this refers to glowing outlines along the balcony edges and structural ridges. The glow should be subtle and diffuse, resembling bioluminescence rather than neon or digital effects. Harsh glows, uniform brightness, or halo artifacts suggest artificiality. The light must interact with surrounding surfaces, casting faint shadows or reflections.",
      "question": "Do the bio-luminescent lines emit a soft, uneven glow that fades naturally at the edges and interacts with nearby surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring structural coherence, this evaluates whether all transformed elements remain connected and proportionate. For example, tentacle extensions should not float away from the main body, and membrane windows should not detach from their frames. Any element that appears detached, oversized, or misaligned compromises visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are all modified elements—tentacles, membranes, textures, and glow lines—properly anchored to the building structure without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving fine details, this checks whether secondary elements like balcony railings, planters, and interior furnishings remain visible and intact after editing. If these details are erased, blurred, or distorted due to texture overlays, it reduces perceptual quality. The presence of small objects like potted plants or furniture helps ground the scene in reality.",
      "question": "Are balcony railings, interior furniture, and planters still visible and undistorted beneath the added textures and lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
