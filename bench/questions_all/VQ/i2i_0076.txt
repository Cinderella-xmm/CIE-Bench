Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the overall realism and natural appearance while adding the word "warm" at the top left corner, we check if the addition harmonizes with the image's existing elements and does not introduce any unnatural textures or artifacts.
Question: Does the word "warm" blend seamlessly into the top left corner without disrupting the natural appearance and introducing any unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of ensuring structural coherence after adding text elements, the placement of "warm" should not distort the geometric shapes present in the image, particularly around the sofa and cushions.
Question: Has the addition of the word "warm" at the top left corner maintained the structural consistency of surrounding elements like the sofa and cushions, avoiding any distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: To uphold the visual plausibility and authenticity, the word "warm" should appear in a font and size that complements the imageâ€™s aesthetic, ensuring it doesn't look out of place or disproportionately large.
Question: Does the size and font of the word "warm" maintain visual plausibility and authentic integration with the rest of the image?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement emphasizes preserving the natural appearance and absence of obvious artifacts, so the inclusion of "freedom" at the bottom right corner should not degrade fine details in that area.
Question: Is the word "freedom" at the bottom right corner added in a manner that preserves the fine details of the floor and plant, avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Structural coherence requires that the addition of "freedom" does not interfere with the integrity of the adjacent geometric shapes, such as the corner of the rug and the base of the plant pot.
Question: Does the placement of the word "freedom" at the bottom right corner respect the structural integrity of nearby elements, such as the corner of the rug and plant pot base, without causing any visible distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
