      "thinking_process": "To ensure the character's defensive shield-raising pose is visually credible and structurally consistent, it is important to assess if the positioning and angle of the shield match the character's posture naturally.",
      "question": "Is the shield held in a manner that complements the character's posture without introducing distorted or broken geometric shapes?",

      "thinking_process": "To validate that the character’s transition into a 3D form maintains structural coherence and avoids distortion, it is necessary to inspect if the proportions of the character's visible body parts are realistic and undistorted.",
      "question": "Do the visible parts of the character’s body maintain proper proportions, avoiding distortion or unnatural scaling?",
