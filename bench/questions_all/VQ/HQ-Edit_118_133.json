      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"translating the metallic texture of the teapot into a high-gloss ceramic finish\", evaluate whether the material transformation at the body of the teapot maintains a natural appearance and avoids unnatural textures or gloss inconsistencies. The original image shows a highly reflective metallic surface with intricate engravings; converting this to ceramic requires preserving fine details while altering reflectivity and texture.",
      "question": "Does the surface of the teapotâ€™s body exhibit a consistent, smooth high-gloss ceramic finish without visible texture artifacts or abrupt transitions from the original metallic look?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"replacing the spout with a wick\", assess whether the new element (wick) is physically plausible and structurally coherent with the rest of the object. The original spout is curved and ornate; replacing it with a thin wick must maintain spatial logic and avoid geometric distortion.",
      "question": "Is the wick positioned at the tip of the former spout location in a straight, vertical orientation that aligns naturally with the candle design, without bending or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"converting the handle into a decorative gold accent\", evaluate whether the material change from dark wood and metal to gold maintains visual credibility and structural integrity. The original handle has a curved wooden grip with metal fittings; transforming it into gold should preserve shape but alter material properties.",
      "question": "Is the handle now rendered as a solid gold-colored accent with no visible remnants of the original wood or metal, and does it retain its original curvature without warping or unnatural thickness changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding a subtle floral pattern around the base\", determine whether the added pattern integrates seamlessly with the existing ornamental style and does not introduce visual noise or mismatched scale. The original teapot features elaborate baroque-style engravings; the new floral design must match this aesthetic.",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns around the base of the teapot evenly spaced, proportionally scaled, and stylistically consistent with the existing engraved motifs, without overlapping or distorting the base structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"naming it 'Eternal Elegance Candle' in elegant script at the front\", evaluate whether the text is legible, stylistically appropriate, and integrated without disrupting the surface continuity. The original image has no text; adding script must not appear floating or misaligned.",
      "question": "Is the text \"Eternal Elegance Candle\" placed centrally on the front face of the teapot in a flowing script font that matches the luxury theme, with no pixelation, shadowing, or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
