Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "enhance her form with comic-style muscular exaggeration", this involves modifying the athlete's musculature, particularly in the arms, shoulders, and abdomen. The editing position includes the upper body and limbs. This transformation must preserve anatomical plausibility while introducing stylized exaggeration. The evaluation focuses on whether the exaggerated muscles maintain structural coherence, avoid unnatural bulges or distortions, and retain smooth transitions between muscle groups without breaking geometric continuity.
Question: Do the exaggerated muscles on the athlete’s arms, shoulders, and abdomen follow natural anatomical contours without introducing unnatural bulges or broken shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "render her gloves in fiery red with gold accents", the editing targets the boxing gloves worn by the athlete. The original gloves are red with white wrist straps. The modification involves changing the color to a more intense fiery red and adding gold accents. The evaluation checks whether the new color scheme maintains material realism (e.g., leather texture), whether the gold accents appear integrated rather than pasted-on, and whether there are no texture artifacts or color bleeding at the edges.
Question: Are the fiery red gloves with gold accents visually consistent in material texture and color, with no visible seams, pixelation, or unnatural highlights?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "set against an electrifying backdrop with vibrant strobe lights", the background has been modified from a standard arena setting to one featuring dynamic, pulsing strobe effects. The editing position is the entire background, especially around the ceiling lights and ambient lighting. Evaluation focuses on whether the strobe effect appears physically plausible (e.g., light diffusion, shadow consistency), whether it integrates naturally with the existing environment, and whether there are no ghosting, double exposure, or inconsistent light sources that break visual credibility.
Question: Are the strobe lights in the background evenly distributed and consistent in direction and intensity, without creating unnatural shadows or light leaks?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "incorporate a blank motivational quote panel on the side", a new element (the panel) has been added to the image, likely positioned along the right or left edge of the frame. The panel should be visually coherent with the rest of the composition—its shape, border, and surface texture should not clash with the scene. Evaluation checks whether the panel is seamlessly integrated, has proper depth cues, and does not introduce floating edges or mismatched lighting.
Question: Is the blank motivational quote panel aligned with the perspective of the scene and does it have consistent lighting and shadowing to appear as if part of the environment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "present as a trio of gym wall prints, using bold typography to amplify the sportif energy", the final output is intended as a series of prints. However, since only one image is being evaluated, we assess whether the current image contains elements that would support such a print format—specifically, whether the composition, framing, and text space allow for scalable, high-quality reproduction. The focus is on whether the central figure is properly centered, the background is balanced, and any added text area (like the quote panel) is large enough and free of distortion for legible printing.
Question: Is the composition balanced and framed appropriately so that the central figure and key elements (gloves, stance, lighting) remain clear and undistorted when scaled for print?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
