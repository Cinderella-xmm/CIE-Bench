      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of anthropomorphizing the swirling energy blast (left side of the image) by adding eyes and a mischievous grin, evaluate whether the facial features are integrated into the energy structure without distorting its original shape or light emission. Specifically, check if the eyes and mouth appear within the glowing blue orb, conforming to the curvature and brightness gradient of the energy, and do not introduce unnatural shadows or breaks in the light trail.",
      "question": "Are the eyes and grin added to the energy blast positioned within the glowing orb and aligned with its curvature, without creating jagged edges or broken light paths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a dialogue bubble near the anthropomorphized energy spirit, assess whether the bubble is placed in a clear area of the image (such as above or beside the energy orb) without overlapping Naruto’s head or hand, and whether its font and outline follow standard comic conventions. Check for visual obstruction or distortion caused by the bubble.",
      "question": "Is the dialogue bubble positioned so that it does not overlap with Naruto’s face or hand, and does it have clean borders and readable text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of depicting the fusion of the spirit with the opposing force in page 2, evaluate whether the interaction between the energy spirit and Naruto’s attack shows a logical convergence of motion lines, light beams, and particle effects. Check if the fusion point maintains continuity in direction and intensity of energy flow without sudden gaps or misaligned vectors.",
      "question": "Do the motion lines and energy beams from the spirit and Naruto’s attack converge smoothly at the fusion point, showing continuous flow without abrupt breaks or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding swirling debris and elemental fragments to the background, assess whether these elements are distributed with consistent lighting, shadow, and size relative to the foreground characters. Check if the fragments appear to be part of the same spatial environment, with proper depth cues and no floating or flat textures.",
      "question": "Are the debris and elemental fragments in the background rendered with consistent lighting and shadow, appearing to float in a shared 3D space rather than being pasted flatly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving Naruto’s facial features and proportions, evaluate whether his face remains intact with correct number of whisker marks, eye shape, and headband alignment. Check if any editing around the face (e.g., for motion blur or energy effects) has caused warping, missing lines, or extra contours.",
      "question": "Does Naruto’s face retain the original number of whisker marks, eye shape, and headband position, with no distorted lines or missing features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating the action bubble “Ultimate fusion strike!” into the scene, assess whether it is placed in a non-obstructive area (such as near the center of the clash) and whether its font and outline match the style of the dialogue bubble. Check if it interferes with the visibility of key action elements.",
      "question": "Is the action bubble placed in a visible area of the image without covering Naruto’s hand or the fusion point, and does it use consistent styling with the dialogue bubble?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
