      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the lid into a crown-like head, this involves reshaping the dome-shaped top of the teapot into a structured owl head. The original lid has a pointed finial and engraved patterns; these must be integrated into a facial structure. The question evaluates whether the shape change preserves geometric coherence and avoids distortions such as stretched or broken edges, ensuring the head appears structurally plausible.",
      "question": "Is the crown-like head formed from the lid free of distorted edges or broken geometry, and does it maintain a consistent metallic surface with the original teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the spout into a sharp beak, the original curved spout must now resemble a bird's beak. The transformation should preserve the metallic texture and reflectivity while adapting the shape to a pointed, tapering form. The question checks for physical plausibility and continuity of material properties.",
      "question": "Does the spout-to-beak transformation maintain a smooth, continuous metallic surface without cracks, unnatural bends, or texture discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the handle into a gracefully curved tail, the original ornate wooden-style handle must now function as a tail. This involves reorienting its curve and possibly extending its length while retaining the same level of detail and material consistency. The question assesses whether the tail’s shape conforms to natural biomechanical curves and integrates seamlessly with the body.",
      "question": "Is the tail formed from the handle smoothly curved and proportionally aligned with the body, without abrupt angles or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding cog-filled eyes that glow softly, the eyes must be placed where the lid’s front would face forward. They should appear embedded within the metallic surface, with internal gears visible and soft light emanating from them. The question evaluates whether the eyes integrate naturally into the head, with proper lighting and texture alignment.",
      "question": "Are the mechanical eyes positioned symmetrically on the head, with visible cogs and soft glow that do not cause halos, color bleeding, or texture mismatch with surrounding metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the owl on a richly carved wooden branch, the original table surface must be replaced or extended to include a new support element. The branch should match the lighting and depth of the scene, with realistic wood grain and shadows. The question checks whether the branch appears grounded and integrated into the environment.",
      "question": "Is the wooden branch beneath the owl well-integrated into the scene, with consistent wood texture, shadowing, and depth relative to the original table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting engraved patterns into metallic feathers, the original floral and scrollwork designs must now resemble layered feather structures. The transformation should preserve fine detail and metallic sheen while adapting the pattern orientation to suggest plumage. The question assesses whether the texture remains coherent and does not appear flattened or artificially repeated.",
      "question": "Do the engraved patterns across the body now resemble metallic feathers with consistent layering and directionality, without pixelation or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
