Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the colossal robot into a miniature 3D articulated model, evaluate whether the scale reduction maintains structural coherence and proportional accuracy relative to the original robot's form. The transformation involves shrinking a massive mech into a small-scale model, which must preserve key geometric features such as limb articulation, joint placement, and overall silhouette without introducing distortions like stretched limbs or collapsed joints. This affects visual credibility and structural consistency.
Question: Does the miniature robot model retain accurate proportions and intact geometric shapes compared to the original robot, with no visible stretching, compression, or misaligned joints?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of encasing the robot in a sleek, circular display case, assess whether the transparent enclosure is visually coherent with the model inside. The case must appear seamless and physically plausible, with proper reflections, refractions, and thickness consistent with glass or acrylic material. Any unnatural edges, ghosting, or inconsistent transparency would degrade realism.
Question: Is the circular display case transparent and smooth, with natural light interaction and no jagged edges, double outlines, or artificial artifacts around its surface?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding intricate tiny gears under transparent panels on the robot’s surface, evaluate whether these mechanical details are clearly visible, properly scaled, and integrated into the model without disrupting the surface continuity. Gears should be positioned logically within panel areas and not overlap or intersect with non-transparent parts in an implausible way.
Question: Are the tiny gears visible under transparent panels correctly aligned with the robot’s surface, uniformly detailed, and free from overlapping or floating anomalies?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the display on a futuristic hexagonal black base with luminous silver model number etching, assess whether the base has clean geometry, realistic material properties (matte black with subtle sheen), and whether the text appears crisp and illuminated without blurring or pixelation. The font style and glow should match a high-tech aesthetic without appearing artificially pasted.
Question: Is the hexagonal base geometrically precise, with uniform edges and a consistent matte-black finish, and does the model number text appear sharp and evenly glowing without haloing or distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of surrounding the display with a subtly detailed mini landscape evoking the original scene, evaluate whether the miniature environment includes proportionally correct terrain, vegetation, and distant structures that mirror the original image’s composition. The elements must be scaled appropriately and not appear oversized or distorted relative to the display case.
Question: Does the mini landscape surrounding the display include naturally scaled trees, ground textures, and distant cityscape elements that maintain spatial consistency with the size of the display case and model?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
