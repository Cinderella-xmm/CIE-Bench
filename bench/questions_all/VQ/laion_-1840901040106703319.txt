Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction requires transforming the entire log cabin into a giant geometric crystal structure, replacing wooden materials with transparent faceted surfaces. This involves a complete material and structural transformation of the building’s exterior, including the roof, walls, beams, and deck. The original image shows a traditional log cabin with visible wood grain, triangular windows, and a gabled roof supported by vertical posts. The transformation must preserve the overall shape and spatial layout while replacing all elements with crystalline facets. This change affects realism, texture coherence, geometric integrity, and material plausibility.
-Sub requirement 1: Replace the wooden exterior (walls, roof, beams, railings) with transparent faceted crystal surfaces that maintain the original cabin’s structural outline and proportions without introducing distortions or unnatural geometry.
-Sub requirement 2: Ensure the crystal surfaces reflect hues of blue and green in a way that appears consistent with light interaction on transparent materials, avoiding flat or unrealistic coloration.
-Sub requirement 3: Transform the wooden support beams and posts into multifaceted crystal edges that retain their original positions and structural function without breaking geometric continuity or appearing misaligned.
-Sub requirement 4: Replace the ground beneath the cabin with a flat white marble platform, ensuring it is level, smooth, and seamlessly integrated with the base of the crystal structure without visual gaps or texture mismatches.
-Sub requirement 5: Add small crystal formations along the base of the cabin as decorative accents, ensuring they are proportionally scaled, naturally positioned, and do not disrupt the overall symmetry or physical logic of the scene.
-Sub requirement 6: Maintain the surrounding environment (trees, sky, rocks) unchanged to preserve context, ensuring no artifacts or inconsistencies arise from blending the transformed cabin with the natural background.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the wooden exterior with transparent faceted crystal surfaces, this question evaluates whether the new crystal material appears physically plausible and maintains the original cabin's structural form. The focus is on whether the transition from wood to crystal preserves geometric accuracy and avoids unnatural textures or jagged edges.
Question: Are the crystal facets on the cabin’s walls, roof, and windows evenly shaped and aligned with the original cabin’s triangular and rectangular outlines?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of rendering the crystal surfaces with hues of blue and green, this question assesses whether the coloration reflects realistic light behavior on transparent materials, such as subtle gradients and refraction effects, rather than flat or artificial coloring.
Question: Do the blue and green hues on the crystal surfaces show variations in transparency and light reflection consistent with real glass or crystal, rather than uniform solid colors?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming wooden beams into multifaceted crystal edges, this question checks whether the structural supports retain their original positions and proportions while being reimagined as crystal forms, ensuring no distortion or misalignment occurs.
Question: Are the vertical support beams and horizontal railings converted into crystal forms that maintain their original spacing, height, and alignment with the cabin’s frame?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the cabin on a flat white marble platform, this question evaluates whether the platform is uniformly smooth, level, and seamlessly connected to the base of the crystal structure, without visible seams or textural inconsistencies.
Question: Is the white marble platform beneath the cabin flat, continuous, and free of cracks or irregularities, and does it extend evenly under the entire base of the structure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding small crystal formations as decorative accents at the base, this question checks whether these elements are proportionally sized, naturally distributed, and integrated without disrupting the scene’s balance or appearing artificially placed.
Question: Are the small crystal formations along the base of the cabin proportionally smaller than the main structure, grouped in clusters, and positioned in a way that suggests natural growth rather than random placement?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
