      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on Sub requirement 1, the sausages must be replaced with tessellated glass tiles in warm terracotta tones while preserving their elongated cylindrical shape. The evaluation focuses on whether the tile pattern follows the original contour of each sausage without distorting its length, curvature, or thickness. Any deviation in proportion or abrupt angular breaks would indicate structural inconsistency.",
      "question": "Do the tessellated tiles forming the sausages maintain the original elongated, curved shape without geometric distortion or unnatural straightening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on Sub requirement 2, the salad area must be transformed into smaller tessellated tiles in leafy green hues, replicating the natural irregularity of lettuce leaves and cherry tomatoes. The key is assessing whether the tile arrangement captures the organic flow and overlapping layers seen in the original salad, avoiding rigid grid patterns or uniform spacing that suggest artificiality.",
      "question": "Are the green-tiled areas shaped to mimic the natural ruffled edges and layered structure of lettuce leaves, with no uniform or blocky alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on Sub requirement 3, the fried egg must be replaced with round tiles in sunny yellow and white, preserving the circular outline and central yolk placement. The evaluation checks whether the tile layout accurately represents the egg’s oval shape and internal structure, especially the yolk’s position and size, without flattening or misshaping.",
      "question": "Is the egg-shaped tile formation perfectly circular with a centrally placed orange-yellow yolk section, matching the original egg’s proportions and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on Sub requirement 4, the entire mosaic composition must be symmetrically arranged on the plate. This includes balanced placement of the sausage tiles, salad tiles, and egg tiles relative to the plate’s center. The symmetry ensures visual credibility and artistic coherence, so any asymmetry or uneven spacing would compromise the intended design.",
      "question": "Are the mosaic elements positioned symmetrically around the plate’s center, with equal spacing and proportional sizing between the sausage, salad, and egg sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on Sub requirement 5, the glass tile material must appear consistent across all elements, with realistic reflective properties, defined edges, and smooth color gradients. The assessment looks for artifacts such as pixelation, blurred tile boundaries, or inconsistent lighting that could make the tiles look digitally flawed or physically implausible.",
      "question": "Do all glass tiles exhibit uniform edge definition, subtle reflection effects, and consistent color shading without visible artifacts like blurring or jagged lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
