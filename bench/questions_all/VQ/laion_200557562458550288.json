      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the cycling jersey into an anthropomorphic cyclist character by adding facial features on the chest area where the star motif is located, evaluate whether the integration of facial features maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The star on the chest (centered on the blue panel) is a key design element; adding facial features here must preserve geometric integrity and avoid distorting the existing shape or introducing unnatural textures. This involves assessing whether the face appears anatomically plausible and seamlessly blended with the fabric texture.",
      "question": "Are the facial features added over the star motif proportionally aligned and integrated without distorting the star’s shape or creating unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of injecting a sense of speed using stylized motion lines around the character, assess whether these motion lines are consistent in style with the original jersey’s graphic elements (e.g., diagonal stripes, color scheme) and do not introduce artifacts such as jagged edges, inconsistent line thickness, or unnatural overlap with the jersey material. The motion lines should enhance dynamism without breaking the visual continuity of the garment.",
      "question": "Do the motion lines surrounding the character have smooth, consistent strokes that align with the jersey's design language and do not exhibit pixelation or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the existing color scheme while converting the jersey into a dynamic ad poster, evaluate whether the colors used in the new elements (e.g., motion lines, facial features, tagline) remain within the original palette (blue, white, red, gray). Any deviation may disrupt visual harmony and reduce authenticity. The addition of new elements must not introduce unexpected hues or chromatic shifts.",
      "question": "Are all newly added elements (facial features, motion lines, tagline) rendered using only the original jersey’s color scheme (blue, white, red, gray), with no unintended color bleed or mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of including the tagline \"Ride Like a Star!\" in bold, diagonal typography across the bottom left, assess whether the text placement respects the spatial layout of the jersey and does not obscure critical design elements (e.g., \"DALLAS\" text, logo areas). The font style and size must be legible and stylistically coherent with the rest of the design. Evaluate if the text appears warped, clipped, or misaligned.",
      "question": "Is the tagline \"Ride Like a Star!\" positioned diagonally in the bottom-left corner without overlapping or obscuring existing text or graphics, and is it clearly readable without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the jersey into an anthropomorphic character while preserving material realism, evaluate whether the fabric texture of the jersey remains visible and consistent across the entire surface, especially around the newly added facial features and motion lines. The transformation must not cause unnatural stretching, loss of pattern detail (e.g., repeating \"DALLAS\" text), or synthetic-looking surfaces that contradict the original textile appearance.",
      "question": "Does the fabric texture of the jersey, including the repeated \"DALLAS\" pattern and mesh-like sections, remain intact and undistorted even in areas near the added facial features and motion lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
