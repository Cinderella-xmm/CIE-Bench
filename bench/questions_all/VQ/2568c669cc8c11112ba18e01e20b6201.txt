Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the original painting into a digital character card styled like an RPG collectible, which involves adding new graphical elements such as stat bars, title banner, nameplate, filigree frame, and parchment backdrop. These additions must be seamlessly integrated with the original neoclassical painterly style while preserving the emotional tone of the mother-child embrace. The core figures (mother and child) must remain structurally intact and visually coherent within the new composition. The added elements should not distort or obscure the original forms, especially in areas such as faces, hands, drapery, and clothing textures. The color palette must remain warm and harmonious, consistent with the original image’s soft lighting and tonal balance. The integration of digital UI components (stat bars, text) must avoid pixelation, misalignment, or unnatural layering that breaks the illusion of a cohesive artwork.

-Sub requirement 1: Adding stat bars ([Empathy +10], [Protection +9], [Grace +8], [Healing +10])—ensure they are positioned without overlapping key facial features or limbs, maintain legibility, and blend stylistically with the painterly aesthetic through appropriate texture, transparency, and color harmony.

-Sub requirement 2: Inserting a ribbon-textured title banner above the figures—verify it does not distort the upper portion of the heads or hair, maintains natural fabric folds and shading, and matches the warm color palette of the original.

-Sub requirement 3: Placing a golden nameplate below the figures—confirm it is proportionally scaled, does not interfere with the lower body or drapery, and has a material appearance consistent with metallic sheen and embossed texture without artificial glow or jagged edges.

-Sub requirement 4: Framing the entire card with ornate filigree—check that the frame does not clip or distort the edges of the figures or background, and that its design complements the neoclassical style without introducing modern or mismatched patterns.

-Sub requirement 5: Replacing the original background with a soft parchment backdrop—ensure the transition between the original figures and the new background is seamless, with no visible seams, color shifts, or loss of depth perception.

-Sub requirement 6: Preserving the gentle embrace and warm color palette—evaluate whether the skin tones, drapery, and lighting remain consistent and unaltered by the edits, particularly around the arms, faces, and hands where anatomical accuracy and soft shadows are critical.

-Sub requirement 7: Ensuring all added elements (text, banners, frame) do not introduce artifacts such as blurring, aliasing, unnatural textures, or inconsistent lighting that breaks the perceived realism of the original painting.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding stat bars without overlapping key facial features or limbs, this question evaluates whether the placement of the stat bars respects the spatial boundaries of the figures, particularly around the heads, arms, and torso, to preserve visual coherence and avoid occlusion.
Question: Are the stat bars positioned such that they do not cover any part of the mother's or child's face, hands, or clothing?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of inserting a ribbon-textured title banner above the figures, this question assesses whether the banner integrates naturally with the existing composition, especially concerning the hairline and head shape, avoiding distortion or unnatural folding.
Question: Does the ribbon-textured banner sit above the figures without distorting the hair or altering the natural curvature of the heads?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing a golden nameplate below the figures, this question checks whether the nameplate is proportionally sized and positioned to avoid interfering with the lower limbs or drapery, and whether its material appearance (metallic sheen, embossing) is consistent with the overall style.
Question: Is the golden nameplate positioned below the figures without overlapping the legs or skirt, and does it display a smooth, reflective surface without pixelation or jagged edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of framing the card with ornate filigree, this question evaluates whether the frame is applied uniformly around the image without clipping or warping the edges of the figures or background, ensuring structural consistency.
Question: Does the ornate filigree frame enclose the entire image without cutting off any part of the figures, drapery, or background?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the background with a soft parchment backdrop, this question assesses whether the transition between the original painted figures and the new background is seamless, maintaining depth and avoiding abrupt color changes or visible seams.
Question: Is the parchment backdrop uniformly blended behind the figures, with no visible edges, color mismatches, or shadow inconsistencies along the figure outlines?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving the gentle embrace and warm color palette, this question evaluates whether the skin tones, lighting, and drapery remain consistent and unaltered by the addition of digital elements, particularly in areas like the arms, hands, and faces where fine details are critical.
Question: Do the skin tones and lighting on the mother and child remain consistent with the original image, with no unnatural color shifts or brightness changes caused by overlay elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q7: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts such as blurring or aliasing, this question checks whether the added text and decorative elements have sharp, clean edges and natural textures, especially in high-detail areas like the stat bars and filigree.
Question: Are the text elements and decorative borders sharp and free from blurring, pixelation, or jagged lines that would indicate low-resolution rendering?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
