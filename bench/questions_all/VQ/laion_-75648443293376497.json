      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the fabric with a rugged leather texture, evaluate whether the material transformation at the entire backpack surface maintains visual coherence and natural appearance. The original image shows a canvas-like fabric with visible stitching and uniform texture; the replacement must preserve structural integrity while introducing a leather texture that does not appear artificially applied or inconsistent in tone, grain, or thickness.",
      "question": "Does the leather texture across the backpack's main body appear uniformly consistent in grain, color, and thickness without unnatural seams or patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enhancing buckles with an antique brass finish, assess whether the metallic elements (specifically the two silver-colored buckles on the front flap) have been modified to reflect a brass-like material with appropriate patina and reflective properties. The original buckles are silver-toned and metallic; any change must maintain geometric accuracy and avoid distortions such as uneven edges or incorrect lighting reflections.",
      "question": "Are the buckle surfaces altered to display a brass-like finish with subtle tarnishing and realistic light reflection, without deformed shapes or mismatched highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding vintage travel patches along the sides, evaluate whether the patches are placed on the side pockets (visible on both left and right sides of the backpack) in a way that respects the original pocket shape and stitching alignment. The patches should be integrated seamlessly without overlapping existing textures or distorting the surrounding fabric.",
      "question": "Are the travel patches positioned on the side pockets with proper alignment to the stitching and fabric contours, showing no warping or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of overlaying typography branding \"EXPLORE VINTAGE\" on the front flap, assess whether the text is placed centrally on the flap area (above the lower pocket and below the top closure) with legible font style and depth that matches the vintage theme. The text must not obscure structural details or cause unnatural shadows or blending artifacts.",
      "question": "Is the \"EXPLORE VINTAGE\" text clearly visible on the front flap, properly aligned with the flapâ€™s curvature, and free from jagged edges or ghosting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of creating a sketch-style compass graphic subtly embossed near the base, evaluate whether the compass design is located near the bottom center of the backpack, beneath the main compartment and above the base straps. The embossing should be faint enough to suggest texture without disrupting the leather appearance, and the compass lines should follow logical geometric proportions.",
      "question": "Is the compass graphic near the base of the backpack rendered with fine, consistent lines that follow a circular pattern and do not distort the surrounding leather texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
