      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving the core shape and embroidery details of the purple blouse when converted into a chibi-style magnet, this question evaluates whether the stylized version retains the original V-neckline, short sleeves, and decorative patterns without distorting proportions or losing critical design features. The focus is on structural consistency and the natural appearance of simplified elements.",
      "question": "Is the outline of the purple blouse magnet smooth and symmetrical, with recognizable embroidered patterns intact and not blurred or fragmented?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the geometric structure and clarity of the lehenga's floral patterns during stylization, this question checks whether the pleats, central motifs, and border details are proportionally represented and free from distortion such as skewed angles or missing segments. It assesses visual credibility and fine detail preservation.",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the lehenga magnet evenly spaced and symmetrically arranged, with no broken or misaligned designs?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving the drape and border design of the red dupatta in chibi form, this question examines whether the flowing edge and decorative trim are accurately simplified without unnatural elongation or compression. It focuses on physical plausibility and texture coherence.",
      "question": "Does the red dupatta magnet show a natural curve at the edge, with the border pattern consistently aligned and not stretched or distorted?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of accurately representing jewelry (maang tikka, earrings, bangles) with metallic textures and proper shape in chibi style, this question evaluates whether the small components like beads, stones, and metalwork are stylized but still identifiable and proportionally correct, avoiding unrealistic scaling or fusion of parts.",
      "question": "Are the jewelry elements (maang tikka, earrings, bangles) depicted with clear outlines and consistent metallic sheen, without merged or malformed components?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining visual coherence in the background wall pattern when rendered as a magnet, this question checks whether the repeating ornamental design remains uniform in scale and alignment, without warping or tile-like breaks that would suggest digital artifacting.",
      "question": "Is the background wall pattern magnet composed of repeated motifs that are evenly spaced and aligned, with no visible seams or distortions?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying uniform glossy finish and rounded edges across all magnets, this question evaluates whether each magnet has consistent surface reflection and smooth borders, ensuring no sharp corners or matte patches that break the intended collectible aesthetic.",
      "question": "Do all six magnets have visibly rounded edges and a uniform glossy surface without uneven reflections or dull spots?",
