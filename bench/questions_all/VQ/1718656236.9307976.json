      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the metallic headdress with an Incan-style one featuring feathers and gold accents, this question evaluates whether the new headdress maintains structural coherence and natural integration with the face and hair. Specifically, it checks for symmetry, correct placement of feathers, and absence of distortions such as bent or overlapping elements that would suggest digital artifacting.",
      "question": "Are the feathers on the headdress evenly distributed and symmetrically placed without appearing warped or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting metallic textures into woven textiles with geometric patterns, this question focuses on the shoulder armor and neckpiece areas. It assesses whether the transition from metal to fabric results in a consistent, believable texture pattern that does not show signs of blurring, repeating errors, or abrupt changes in material appearance.",
      "question": "Do the woven textile patterns on the shoulder armor and neckpiece display uniformity and fine detail without visible seams or unnatural texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the necklace into layered gold and turquoise pieces, this question examines the physical plausibility of the layered structure. It checks whether the layers stack logically, whether turquoise inlays are properly embedded within gold frames, and whether there are any floating or detached elements that violate spatial logic.",
      "question": "Are the layers of the necklace stacked in a way that follows gravitational and structural logic, with no turquoise elements appearing suspended or disconnected from the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying warm, regal color tones, this question evaluates color harmony across the edited elements. It specifically checks whether the new colors (such as gold, red, or green) blend naturally with the skin tone and background, avoiding jarring contrasts or unnatural highlights that might suggest over-saturation or incorrect lighting.",
      "question": "Do the warm tones applied to the headdress, textiles, and jewelry match the lighting conditions and skin tone without creating unnatural color casts or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving the hair and earrings during the transformation, this question ensures that the braided hairstyle remains intact and anatomically consistent under the new headdress. It also checks whether the earrings hang naturally from the earlobes without being obscured or distorted by the new design.",
      "question": "Are the braids and earrings clearly visible and undistorted, with no stretching, clipping, or unnatural separation from the head or ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
