      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the flowing water into a shimmering, translucent mane, this edit occurs primarily in the central cascading section where water flows down the rock face. The key perceptual quality concern is whether the new \"mane\" maintains the dynamic flow and translucency of real water, avoiding unnatural rigidity or opacity. The question evaluates the material authenticity and motion fidelity of the edited water region.",
      "question": "Does the shimmering mane formed from the water maintain fluid motion and transparency consistent with the original waterfall, without appearing solid or rigid?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of morphing the rocks into a scale-armored dragon body, this transformation affects the large, layered stone structures in the upper and mid-sections of the image. The evaluation focuses on whether the new scaled surface preserves realistic rock texture and geometric continuity, avoiding unnatural patterns or broken shapes. The question checks for material coherence and structural integrity.",
      "question": "Are the scale patterns on the transformed rock body seamlessly integrated with the original stone texture, without visible seams, unnatural repetition, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the white foam into misty cloud wings, this edit targets the foamy areas at the base and sides of the waterfall. The question assesses whether the cloud-like wings maintain a plausible form and position relative to the water flow, avoiding floating or disconnected appearance. It checks for physical plausibility and compositional harmony.",
      "question": "Do the cloud wings formed from the foam extend naturally from the dragon’s body and align with the direction of water movement, without appearing detached or floating unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding glowing blue aquatic runes on the dragon’s scales, this edit applies to the surface of the transformed rock body. The evaluation centers on whether the runes have soft, luminous edges that blend with the surface, avoiding harsh outlines or over-bright glows that break realism. The question examines light integration and artifact presence.",
      "question": "Are the glowing blue runes embedded into the scales with smooth, diffused light emission and no sharp edges or unnatural brightness that disrupts the surrounding texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining overall lighting and depth consistency, this edit spans the entire scene. The question evaluates whether shadows, highlights, and reflections remain aligned across the transformed elements, ensuring the dragon appears integrated into the environment rather than superimposed. It checks for visual credibility in global illumination.",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dragon’s body and wings match the direction and intensity of natural sunlight in the original scene, without conflicting illumination or floating highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
