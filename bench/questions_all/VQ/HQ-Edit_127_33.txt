Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the topiary into towering, sentient plant creatures adorned with floral crowns, this involves modifying the shape and texture of the existing conical hedges in the foreground and background. The original image shows tall, symmetrical, green conical topiaries flanking the central path. The editing task requires altering their form to appear animate and crowned with flowers. This change must preserve structural coherence—ensuring that the new forms maintain plausible geometry and natural textures without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts such as jagged edges or inconsistent lighting. The evaluation focuses on whether the modified topiary shapes retain visual credibility while appearing otherworldly.
Question: Do the transformed topiary structures maintain smooth, continuous surfaces and natural-looking textures without visible distortion or pixelation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of turning the fountain into a mystical spring with crystalline water cascading over luminescent rocks, the central fountain in the original image is a traditional three-tiered stone structure with water flowing downward. The editing task involves changing the material properties (e.g., making water appear more transparent and glowing) and adding luminous rock elements beneath the flow. This transformation must avoid breaking geometric continuity, such as uneven water flow paths or floating rocks. The evaluation checks whether the altered materials (water and rocks) appear physically plausible within the scene’s lighting and shadow logic.
Question: Does the water in the fountain exhibit consistent transparency and refraction effects, with no unnatural streaks or broken flow patterns?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of integrating enchanted, vine-like paths spiraling upward toward the sky, the original garden features flat, straight pathways bordered by low hedges. The editing instruction introduces vertical, spiral vine structures that extend from ground level into the air. These new elements must not intersect unnaturally with existing terrain or structures and must follow plausible growth patterns. The evaluation assesses whether the spiral vines have coherent thickness, tapering, and curvature, avoiding abrupt breaks or impossible angles.
Question: Are the spiral vine paths seamlessly integrated into the garden landscape, with gradual transitions and no sudden breaks or floating segments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding delicate, iridescent butterfly-like beings fluttering around the garden, these entities must be placed in areas where they interact naturally with light and air currents—such as near the fountain, roses, or topiary. Their presence should not cause occlusion errors or cast incorrect shadows. The evaluation checks whether the butterflies have consistent wing textures, translucency, and motion blur (if applicable), and whether they are positioned in a way that respects depth and perspective.
Question: Are the butterfly-like creatures positioned at varying depths in the scene, with appropriate size scaling and soft edges that match the ambient lighting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adorning the topiary with floral crowns, the original image shows bare, uniformly trimmed hedges. The addition of floral crowns involves placing flower clusters at the apex of each topiary. This modification must ensure that the flowers do not overlap unrealistically with the hedge surface or appear to float above it. The evaluation checks whether the floral crowns are attached with natural-looking stems and spacing, and whether their color and texture harmonize with surrounding flora.
Question: Are the floral crowns positioned at the tops of the topiary structures with natural attachment points and no floating or misaligned petals?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
