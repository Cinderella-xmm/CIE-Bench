      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the wooden table and chairs with LEGO-style block structures, this question evaluates whether the transformation maintains structural coherence by preserving the original rectangular shape and chair positions. It checks if the LEGO bricks form continuous, aligned surfaces without gaps or distortions in geometry.",
      "question": "Are the table and chairs composed of uniformly sized brown and amber LEGO bricks with clean, interlocking edges and no visible breaks or misalignments in their surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of creating interlocking surfaces for the tabletop and seating, this question assesses whether the LEGO brick pattern is consistent across all surfaces and follows realistic LEGO construction principles (e.g., alternating stud patterns). It ensures that the texture does not appear stretched or fragmented.",
      "question": "Do the tabletop and chair seats display a consistent LEGO brick texture with repeating stud patterns and no unnatural stretching or distortion of individual bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding LEGO plant elements in the center, this question checks whether the replacement object (originally a glass bowl with stones) has been replaced with LEGO-compatible plant pieces that match typical LEGO design (e.g., green stems, flat leaves) and are properly scaled relative to the table.",
      "question": "Is the central element on the table a LEGO-style plant made of green bricks with recognizable leaf shapes, and is it positioned centrally without overlapping or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the set on a simplified gray LEGO baseplate, this question evaluates whether the baseplate is present under the furniture, covers only the required area, and contrasts appropriately with the surrounding concrete patio without blending or extending unnaturally.",
      "question": "Is the furniture placed on a flat, gray LEGO baseplate that fits snugly beneath the table and chairs, with no overhang beyond the furniture edges and no visible seam between the baseplate and the real ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts such as unnatural textures or loss of detail, this question examines whether the transition from wood to LEGO introduces visual anomalies like ghosting, blurring, or inconsistent lighting that would suggest poor rendering quality.",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged edges, pixelation, or unnatural lighting shadows around the LEGO furniture that suggest incomplete rendering or poor integration with the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
