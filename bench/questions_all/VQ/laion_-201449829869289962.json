      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding a transparent dome glass case over the scene,\" this question evaluates whether the dome’s surface exhibits realistic optical properties such as subtle reflections, refractions, and transparency without visible seams, distortion, or unnatural glare. The dome should not interfere with the visibility of underlying elements in an inconsistent way.",
      "question": "Does the dome glass case show smooth transparency with realistic light interaction and no visible stitching or warping around the edges?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"scale reduction of the church and landscape,\" this question assesses whether the proportions of the church tower, roof, and surrounding buildings remain consistent with each other after downsizing. Any mismatch in scale could suggest distortion or incorrect scaling.",
      "question": "Are the dimensions of the church tower, roof, and adjacent buildings proportionally consistent with one another as if reduced uniformly?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding tiny alpine-style houses,\" this question checks whether the new houses match the architectural style of the original village—such as gabled roofs, wooden shutters, and stone walls—and are rendered at a correct scale without appearing flattened or misshapen.",
      "question": "Are the newly added small houses aligned with the original architectural style and do they have correctly shaped roofs, windows, and textures without deformation?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"recreating the church tower with a copper roof,\" this question examines whether the roof material has a natural metallic sheen, weathered texture, and color variation typical of aged copper, rather than a uniform or synthetic appearance.",
      "question": "Does the copper roof on the church tower display realistic texture variations, oxidation effects, and lighting response consistent with real copper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"designing a whimsical rolling mist effect,\" this question evaluates whether the mist blends naturally into the mountain background with soft gradients and no sharp boundaries or layered artifacts that disrupt depth perception.",
      "question": "Is the mist along the distant mountains smoothly diffused with gradual opacity changes and no abrupt edges or blocky patterns?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"positioning a small gold pedestal under the case,\" this question checks whether the pedestal is properly sized and placed beneath the diorama, maintaining balance and stability without appearing floating or disproportionately large/small.",
      "question": "Is the gold pedestal positioned directly under the base of the diorama and does it have a solid, grounded appearance with no floating or misaligned parts?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"textured, terraced hills with vineyards,\" this question assesses whether the vineyard rows and hill contours are continuous, evenly spaced, and free from repeating patterns or jagged lines that indicate low-resolution or procedural artifacting.",
      "question": "Do the terraced vineyards show consistent spacing and natural curvature without visible grid lines or pixelated edges?",
