Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "depicting the woman in a semi-cartoon style", evaluate whether the stylization of the woman's facial features, proportions, and overall figure maintains structural coherence and visual credibility. Specifically, check if her facial symmetry, eye shape, hair flow, and body proportions remain consistent with human anatomy while incorporating cartoon-like elements without distorting natural form.
Question: Does the woman’s face maintain symmetrical features with proportionate eyes, nose, and mouth, and does her hair flow naturally without unnatural bending or clipping?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "enhancing her flowing robe with gold-embossed floral details", assess whether the added gold floral patterns appear seamlessly integrated into the fabric texture, avoiding unnatural textures, floating elements, or inconsistent lighting. The focus is on material authenticity and fine detail preservation.
Question: Are the gold-embossed floral patterns on the robe evenly distributed, aligned with the fabric folds, and free from pixelation or floating edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "integrating red lanterns with luminous glow surrounding her silhouette", evaluate whether the glow effect around the lanterns and the woman’s outline appears physically plausible and avoids over-saturation, halo artifacts, or unnatural light bleeding. Check if the glow interacts correctly with surrounding objects.
Question: Do the red lanterns emit a soft, consistent glow that illuminates nearby areas without creating harsh halos or unrealistic light leakage onto the woman’s robe?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "using soft cream paper as background", assess whether the entire image composition simulates a calendar layout with a cream-colored paper base, including visible grid lines for months and floral motifs derived from the robe’s pattern. Check if the background integration is seamless and visually coherent.
Question: Is the background rendered as a uniform cream paper texture with faint month grids and floral patterns matching the robe’s design, without overlapping or misaligned elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "each month's grid designed around the robe's intricate floral patterns", evaluate whether the calendar grid elements (such as borders, text, or divisions) are logically placed within the image space and follow the floral motif without distorting the original scene. Ensure no geometric distortion occurs in the overlay.
Question: Are the calendar grid lines and month labels positioned in a way that follows the floral patterns of the robe without causing misalignment or breaking the continuity of the design?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
