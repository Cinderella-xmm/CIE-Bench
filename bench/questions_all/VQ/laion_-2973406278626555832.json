      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding a simplified laboratory background in Panel 1 that must integrate naturally with the original scene,\" this evaluates whether the background maintains consistent lighting, depth cues, and perspective relative to the foreground figure. The presence of shadows, surface materials, and object scaling must align with the original image's spatial logic.",
      "question": "Does the laboratory background in Panel 1 have consistent lighting and depth alignment with the foreground figure, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"preserving the relative size and position of the vape device and hand during the transition to a comic panel,\" this checks whether the scale and orientation of the device and hand remain anatomically and physically plausible within the new context.",
      "question": "Is the vape device held in the hand at a natural angle and proportion, with no stretching, compression, or misalignment of fingers around it?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"rendering the vape device in detailed, realistic style while retaining its original material properties,\" this assesses whether the glass body, black cap, and liquid inside appear with consistent texture, transparency, and reflection, free from digital artifacts.",
      "question": "Does the vape device in Panel 1 show clear glass transparency, smooth surface reflections, and accurate labeling without pixelation, blurring, or unnatural highlights?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"accurately representing internal components in the cross-section diagram with correct proportions and physical plausibility,\" this evaluates whether the coil, liquid, battery, and airflow paths are depicted with logical spatial relationships and realistic shapes.",
      "question": "Are the internal components in Panel 2 shown with correct relative sizes and connections, such as the coil being positioned above the liquid and the airflow path following a continuous route without broken lines or impossible geometry?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding handwritten-style text and labels without obscuring or distorting underlying elements,\" this checks whether the text placement respects the visibility of the manâ€™s clothing, lanyard, and other features, and whether the font style appears legible and integrated.",
      "question": "Do the text bubbles and labels in both panels avoid overlapping critical facial or clothing features, and are they aligned with natural reading direction without clipping or misplacement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"maintaining natural hand anatomy during the transformation,\" this evaluates whether the hand holding the device has five distinct fingers with proper curvature, spacing, and skin texture, and whether there are no extra or missing digits.",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the vape device have exactly five fingers with natural joint bends and no visible deformities, such as fused or elongated fingers?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"ensuring seamless transition between photographic subject and illustrated panels,\" this checks for visual artifacts such as edge halos, color bleeding, or inconsistent contrast at the boundaries between the real and drawn elements.",
      "question": "Is there a clean boundary between the photographic figure and the illustrated panels, with no visible seams, double outlines, or color mismatches along the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
