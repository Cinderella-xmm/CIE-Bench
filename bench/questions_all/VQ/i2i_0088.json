      "thinking_process": "Considering the sub requirement of \"keeping the napkin unchanged,\" verify if the interaction between the napkin and the newly added gold spoon looks natural. This ensures that the replaced element doesn’t introduce inconsistencies like shadows or highlights that disrupt the overall authenticity.",
      "question": "Does the interaction between the gold spoon and the napkin appear natural without disrupting the napkin’s texture or shadows?",

      "question": "Do the patterns on the gold spoon integrate naturally with the scene and appear as part of the spoon rather than a separate overlay?",

      "question": "Does the gold spoon exhibit realistic reflectivity and shine consistent with a metallic spoon under the lighting conditions of the image?",
