      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the cactus arms into segmented, flexible appendages ending in glowing orbs, this evaluates the shape, proportion, and continuity of the modified limbs. The original arms are thick, ribbed, and upright; any segmentation should preserve their general direction and tapering while introducing joint-like divisions. The glowing orbs at the ends must appear integrated and not abruptly attached. The question checks for unnatural bending, broken geometry, or misaligned segments.",
      "question": "Do the cactus arms show smooth, continuous segmentation without abrupt breaks or distorted joints, and do the glowing orbs at their ends appear naturally attached and aligned with the limb direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of covering the cactus surface with iridescent scales that blend desert hues, this evaluates material authenticity and texture coherence. The original cactus has vertical ribs and spines; the new scales must overlay these features without clashing textures or repeating patterns. Iridescence should vary subtly across surfaces, matching light direction and not appearing as flat color patches.",
      "question": "Are the iridescent scales evenly distributed across the cactus surface, following the original rib pattern without visible seams, repetitive textures, or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of morphing the central column into a crystal spine, this evaluates structural plausibility and optical consistency. The crystal must extend vertically from the base, maintain symmetry, and exhibit realistic refraction and translucency. It should not appear as a pasted object or break the continuity of the original trunk’s shape.",
      "question": "Does the crystal spine rise vertically from the base of the cactus with consistent facets and internal clarity, maintaining alignment with the original trunk and showing no signs of digital clipping or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating bioluminescent thorn-like tendrils that map the cactus's form, this evaluates spatial logic and lighting consistency. Tendrils should emerge from the surface in a natural growth pattern, avoid overlapping in illogical ways, and emit light that interacts realistically with nearby objects and shadows.",
      "question": "Are the bioluminescent tendrils positioned along the cactus’s surface in a coherent, organic pattern, with consistent thickness and spacing, and do they cast soft glows that match the ambient lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of anchoring the transformed cactus on sandy terrain as a sentient sentinel, this evaluates grounding and shadow coherence. The base must remain embedded in the sand, casting a shadow that matches the sun angle and does not float or disconnect from the ground. Surrounding vegetation should not be obstructed or displaced unnaturally.",
      "question": "Is the base of the transformed cactus fully grounded in the sand, casting a shadow that aligns with the light source and does not show floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
