      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the attire into an elaborate African tribal art-inspired mosaic while preserving original geometric patterns, evaluate whether the patterned dress maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The editing involves converting fabric texture into a mosaic-like appearance, which may introduce unnatural tiling or broken geometry if not executed carefully. Focus on whether the shapes remain intact, aligned, and consistent with physical logic.",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the dress preserved as continuous, non-distorted shapes without broken edges or misaligned tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reimagining beaded jewelry as vibrant stained glass tiles, assess whether the material transformation retains visual credibility. The original beads are small, spherical, and layered; replacing them with stained glass implies flat, translucent, angular surfaces. Check for unnatural transitions, inconsistent lighting, or loss of fine detail that could break realism.",
      "question": "Do the necklaces appear as flat, transparent stained glass tiles with consistent color gradients and no jagged or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of retaining the colorful hairstyle as a bas-relief sculpture, evaluate whether the hair maintains its original structure but is now rendered in 3D relief form. This change affects depth perception and surface texture. Ensure the braids do not lose their individuality or show unnatural flattening or warping.",
      "question": "Are the individual braids still distinguishable and proportionally accurate, with smooth transitions between segments and no collapsed or fused strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the landscape into a tapestry of warm earth tones capturing Africaâ€™s diverse terrains, assess whether the background transformation preserves natural terrain features. The original image shows a savanna with distant hills; the edited version should maintain plausible topography and texture without artificial stitching or uniform coloring.",
      "question": "Does the background display varied textures and elevation changes consistent with natural terrain, without uniform patches or unnatural color blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining cultural essence through accessories and attire, evaluate whether the bracelets on the arms retain their original placement and number while being transformed into mosaic or stained-glass style. Check for symmetry, correct count (original has multiple stacked bracelets), and absence of deformation.",
      "question": "Are the bracelets on both arms symmetrically positioned, correctly numbered, and free from distortion such as stretching or overlapping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
