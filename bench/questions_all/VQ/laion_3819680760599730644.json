      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the lens into wide eyes, this involves changing the central circular element of the camera into a stylized eye. The evaluation focuses on whether the new eye design retains the original lens's circular symmetry and reflective surface properties while adding cartoon features like iris and pupil. It checks for distortions in shape, unnatural highlights, or broken textures around the lens rim.",
      "question": "Is the lens area transformed into eyes with smooth, symmetrical shapes and natural-looking reflections, without jagged edges or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using the buttons as expressive brows, this targets the top-left portion of the camera where the mode dial and shutter button are located. The modification should preserve the original button shapes but stylize them as eyebrows. The question evaluates whether the reshaping maintains geometric integrity and avoids warping or stretching that would break the button’s original form.",
      "question": "Are the buttons on top of the camera reshaped into brows with preserved circular and rectangular outlines, without deformation or unnatural contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a small explorer’s hat on the top of the camera, near the \"Canon\" logo, this involves placing a new object above the camera body. The evaluation checks whether the hat is proportionally sized relative to the camera, has proper shading, and is anchored realistically without floating or clipping through the camera surface.",
      "question": "Is the explorer’s hat positioned correctly on top of the camera, with consistent lighting and no visible gaps or overlaps with the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a mini backpack to the back of the camera, even though it's not visible from the front, any visible part (like a strap or edge) should appear in the image. The evaluation checks for plausible attachment points and shadowing if any part extends into the visible frame, ensuring it doesn’t look artificially glued or disconnected.",
      "question": "If any part of the backpack is visible, does it show realistic shadows and attachment to the camera body without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the background with a jungle scene, this involves changing the white backdrop to an illustrated environment. The evaluation checks whether the transition between the camera and the new background is seamless, with no visible edges, halos, or color mismatches along the camera outline.",
      "question": "Does the jungle background blend smoothly with the camera’s edges, without visible outlines, pixelation, or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding the tagline “Capture every quest!”, this involves inserting text into the image. The evaluation checks whether the text is clearly readable, stylistically appropriate (bold, dynamic), and placed without overlapping key features like the lens or brand name, and whether it has proper drop shadow or depth for integration.",
      "question": "Is the tagline “Capture every quest!” clearly visible, stylistically consistent with the cartoon theme, and positioned without obscuring important camera details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
