Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the sports-themed bedspread into a LEGO block quilt. This involves replacing the existing patchwork design with multicolored LEGO-like blocks, where spherical sports items (football, basketball, soccer ball, baseball) are recreated using round tile pieces. This transformation affects the entire surface of the quilt, including color, texture, and shape. The original quilt has a soft fabric appearance with stitched patterns, while the new version must simulate rigid, interlocking LEGO bricks. Attention must be paid to whether the transition from fabric to plastic-like texture maintains visual coherence and avoids unnatural textures or distortions in geometry.
-Sub requirement 1: Replace the quilt’s fabric pattern with a LEGO block design, ensuring that the new material appears consistent with LEGO tiles (e.g., matte finish, grid lines), and verify that the transition does not introduce artifacts such as blurred edges, inconsistent shading, or mismatched proportions.
-Sub requirement 2: Recreate the sports balls (football, basketball, soccer ball, baseball) using round LEGO tile pieces; check if these circular elements maintain proper proportions, alignment, and depth relative to surrounding square blocks, avoiding flattening or warping.
-Sub requirement 3: Replace the pillow with a cube made of stacked LEGO bricks; assess whether the cube is geometrically accurate (equal sides, right angles), properly scaled relative to the bed, and visually consistent with the rest of the LEGO theme.
-Sub requirement 4: Change the bed frame and base to a plain white LEGO baseplate; evaluate whether the bed structure now appears flat, uniform, and free of shadows or depth inconsistencies that would suggest it's not a solid baseplate.
-Sub requirement 5: Set the background to a smooth white surface; ensure no visible walls, windows, or furniture remain, and confirm that lighting is even and without reflections or shadows suggesting an original room environment.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the quilt with a LEGO block design, this question evaluates whether the material texture of the quilt has been successfully changed to resemble LEGO tiles—specifically checking for the presence of grid lines, matte surface, and consistent block shapes. The original quilt has soft stitching and fabric folds; the edited version must avoid fabric-like wrinkles or seams and instead show clean, rigid edges typical of LEGO.
Question: Does the quilt display uniform square blocks with visible grid lines and a matte finish consistent with LEGO bricks, without any fabric-like folds or stitching?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of recreating sports balls using round LEGO tile pieces, this question checks whether the circular elements (e.g., football, soccer ball) are proportionally correct and integrated into the grid without distortion. In the original image, these are printed on fabric; in the edited version, they must appear as raised or inset circular tiles within the block structure.
Question: Are the round sports elements (e.g., football, soccer ball) represented as circular LEGO tiles with consistent size and alignment within the square grid, without stretching or deformation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the pillow with a cube of stacked LEGO bricks, this question assesses the structural accuracy of the new pillow. It must be a perfect cube with equal sides, sharp edges, and no gaps between bricks, matching the scale of the bed and the surrounding LEGO elements.
Question: Is the pillow replaced by a cube composed of stacked LEGO bricks with equal dimensions on all sides, right angles, and no visible gaps or misalignments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of changing the bed base to a plain white LEGO baseplate, this question evaluates whether the bed frame and foundation now appear flat, seamless, and uniformly white, consistent with a LEGO baseplate. The original bed has a wooden frame and white box spring; the edited version must remove all non-baseplate features.
Question: Is the bed base a flat, white, seamless surface with no visible wood grain, shadows, or depth cues, resembling a standard LEGO baseplate?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of setting the background to a smooth white surface, this question checks whether all original environmental elements (walls, window, nightstand, rug, picture) have been removed and replaced with a uniform white backdrop. The lighting should be even without directional shadows or highlights that suggest a real room.
Question: Is the entire background a smooth, uniform white surface with no visible walls, furniture, or windows, and are there no shadows or lighting gradients indicating a physical space?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
