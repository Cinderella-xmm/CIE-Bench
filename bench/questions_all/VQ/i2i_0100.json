      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence and avoiding distortions like broken geometric shapes while generating a top-down view and an angled side view of the sink structure, we assess the fidelity of the visual representation of the sink's edges and cabinetry in both views.",
      "question": "Are the edges of the sinks and cabinets accurately depicted without any broken or warped shapes in both the top-down and angled side views?",

      "thinking_process": "Considering the necessity to reflect overall realism and natural appearance during the transition from a front-facing perspective to additional views, we examine if the lighting and shadow transitions align naturally with the new perspectives created.",
      "question": "Do the shadows and light reflections on the countertop, mirrors, and cabinetry appear natural and consistent with the lighting sources in both the top-down and angled side views?",

      "thinking_process": "In relation to the demand for preserving fine details and avoiding unnatural textures, we analyze if the material texture of surfaces like the marble countertop and white paint on the cabinetry is preserved across the views.",
      "question": "Does the texture of the marble countertop and the finish of the white cabinetry remain clear and authentic in both the top-down and angled side views?",

      "thinking_process": "To ensure that the edits maintain visual plausibility and structural consistency, particularly concerning the positioning of elements like the faucets and fixtures, we verify their alignment and proportionality relative to the sink basins.",
      "question": "Are the faucets and fixtures proportionate and correctly positioned relative to the sink basins in both the top-down and angled side views without any distortions?",

      "question": "Is the layout of the top-down view and angled side view logically arranged and spaced to facilitate easy interpretation of the sink structure?",
