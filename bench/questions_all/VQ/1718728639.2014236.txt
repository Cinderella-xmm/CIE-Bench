Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction requires transforming the metallic armor into shimmering tesserae with geometric patterns in gold and azure. This involves a material transformation from solid metal to mosaic-like tiles, which affects texture, reflectivity, and surface detail. The original image shows a smooth, reflective metallic armor with fine engraved lines. The conversion must preserve structural integrity while introducing new textures without breaking geometry or creating unnatural seams. Therefore, attention must be paid to whether the tesserae follow the original contours of the armor, maintain consistent scale, and avoid visual artifacts like misaligned tiles or inconsistent lighting.

-Sub requirement 1: Transform the metallic armor into tesserae-style mosaic, ensuring that the new material maintains structural coherence with the original armor shape, avoids broken or misaligned tile edges, and preserves natural lighting and shadow interactions.

-Thinking process 2: The wings are to be stylized with ornate feather motifs, replacing their current realistic metallic texture. The original wings have layered, feather-like structures with metallic sheen. Converting them into stylized forms must retain the overall wing shape and proportion while introducing decorative patterns. The key concern is whether the stylization distorts the wing’s anatomy or introduces unnatural bends, gaps, or asymmetries.

-Sub requirement 2: Modify the wing structure to include ornate feather motifs, ensuring that the stylized feathers maintain anatomical plausibility, do not distort the wing’s span or curvature, and preserve symmetry between left and right wings.

-Thinking process 3: The background is to be transformed into a celestial dome with a radiant light circle and decorative borders echoing ancient Christian iconography. The original background is blurred and modern, possibly futuristic. The new background must seamlessly integrate with the foreground figure without visible blending errors, such as mismatched depth, color bleeding, or unnatural gradients. It must also maintain spatial consistency with the figure's position and scale.

-Sub requirement 3: Replace the background with a celestial dome featuring a radiant light circle and iconographic borders, ensuring that the dome appears to surround the figure naturally, maintains proper perspective, and does not introduce visible artifacts like sharp edges or inconsistent lighting.

-Thinking process 4: The crown and neckpiece are part of the original metallic design and must now reflect the Byzantine mosaic style. This includes adding geometric patterns and gold/azure coloration while preserving the form and structural details of the original headpiece. The transition must not cause warping or loss of fine details such as engravings or gem placements.

-Sub requirement 4: Convert the crown and neckpiece into mosaic style, ensuring that the intricate patterns align with the original shape, maintain symmetry, and do not obscure or distort underlying structural elements.

-Thinking process 5: The entire figure must be rendered in a cohesive Byzantine mosaic aesthetic, meaning all materials (armor, wings, crown) must share a unified visual language. This includes consistent use of gold and azure tones, similar tile sizes, and matching light reflection properties. Any deviation may break the visual harmony and reduce perceived authenticity.

-Sub requirement 5: Ensure all edited elements (armor, wings, crown, background) conform to a unified Byzantine mosaic style, maintaining consistent material properties, color palette, and lighting behavior across the entire composition.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the metallic armor into shimmering tesserae with gold and azure patterns, this question evaluates whether the material change at the chest and torso area maintains structural coherence and avoids unnatural textures. The focus is on whether the mosaic tiles follow the contours of the armor without distortion, and if the lighting reflects consistently across the surface.
Question: Do the tesserae on the chest and torso follow the original armor’s curves without visible breaks, misalignments, or inconsistent tile sizes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of stylizing the wings with ornate feather motifs, this question checks whether the wing structure remains anatomically plausible and symmetrical after editing. The focus is on the left and right wings to ensure they mirror each other and maintain natural feather layering despite stylization.
Question: Are the left and right wings symmetrically styled with ornate feathers, and do they maintain natural layering and curvature without unnatural bends or gaps?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the background with a celestial dome featuring a radiant light circle and iconographic borders, this question assesses whether the new background integrates naturally with the figure. The focus is on depth, lighting consistency, and absence of visible seams or clipping artifacts.
Question: Does the celestial dome background appear to surround the figure without visible edges, color bleeding, or inconsistencies in lighting direction?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the crown and neckpiece into mosaic style, this question evaluates whether the intricate patterns on these elements remain aligned with the original structure and maintain symmetry. The focus is on the central gem, the shape of the crown, and the connection to the neckpiece.
Question: Are the mosaic patterns on the crown and neckpiece aligned with the original shape, symmetrically placed, and free of distorted or missing sections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining a unified Byzantine mosaic style across all elements, this question checks whether the color and material consistency is preserved across the armor, wings, and crown. The focus is on whether gold and azure tones are uniformly applied and whether light interaction is consistent across surfaces.
Question: Are the gold and azure colors used consistently across the armor, wings, and crown, with matching reflectivity and no abrupt transitions between materials?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
