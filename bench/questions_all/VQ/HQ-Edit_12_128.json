      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the wooden frame and decorative elements with frosted crystal, evaluate whether the new material maintains the original shape and structural details without introducing distortions such as warped edges, inconsistent translucency, or loss of fine carvings. The original clock has ornate floral and scrollwork at the top and sides; these must remain geometrically intact under the crystal material.",
      "question": "Does the frosted crystal frame preserve the original carved details (such as the floral crest and side columns) without warping or flattening the shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the clock face with smooth, clear crystal featuring etched Roman numerals, assess whether the numerals are accurately positioned in their original locations, have consistent depth and clarity, and do not blur or fade due to the transparent material. The original numerals are black and clearly spaced around the dial.",
      "question": "Are the Roman numerals etched into the crystal face evenly spaced, legible, and aligned with the original hour positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reshaping the pendulum into a faceted crystal ornament, check whether the new pendulum has a symmetrical, physically plausible form, is properly connected to the chains, and displays realistic light refraction through its facets. The original pendulum is circular with an engraved center and hangs centrally below the clock.",
      "question": "Is the faceted crystal pendulum symmetrically shaped, properly suspended by the chains, and free from floating or misaligned connections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of mounting the clock on a minimalist white marble wall, evaluate whether the background is uniform in color and texture, lacks visible seams or abrupt transitions, and casts appropriate shadows consistent with the clock's position and lighting direction.",
      "question": "Is the white marble wall uniformly textured, free from visible stitching or artificial boundaries, and does it cast soft, natural shadows beneath the clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining visual credibility across all components, check whether the transition between the crystal frame, face, hands, and pendulum appears seamlessâ€”ensuring no material mismatches, such as sudden opacity shifts, incorrect reflections, or disconnected joints.",
      "question": "Are the crystal components (frame, face, pendulum) visually integrated without noticeable gaps, material inconsistencies, or unnatural reflections at their junctions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
