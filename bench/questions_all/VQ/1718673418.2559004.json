      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming rooftops into mushroom canopies, this edit involves altering the shape and material of the roof structures. The original roofs are traditional gabled forms; changing them to mushroom-shaped canopies introduces organic curvature and new textures. To evaluate perceptual quality, we must check whether the new shapes are smoothly integrated, maintain consistent scale relative to the buildings, and use materials (e.g., cap-like surfaces) that appear natural and free of artifacts like clipping or misalignment.",
      "question": "Are the mushroom-shaped rooftops proportionally scaled to the buildings and do they display smooth, continuous surfaces without visible seams or distorted geometry?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of turning the lake reflection into a shimmering mirage, this involves modifying the waterâ€™s surface properties. The original reflection is clear and mirror-like; introducing a mirage effect should create soft, wavy distortions that mimic heat haze or magical refraction. We need to verify that the shimmering effect does not break the water's surface continuity, introduces no blocky noise, and remains visually consistent with the surrounding environment.",
      "question": "Does the lake surface show a uniform, flowing shimmer effect without pixelated or fragmented patterns, and does it reflect the sky and buildings in a way that appears fluid and continuous?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of turning the mountains into towering roots, this edit transforms geological formations into biological structures. The original mountains are rocky and angular; converting them into root-like forms requires maintaining structural integrity while adding organic curves and textures. We must assess whether the root shapes are anatomically plausible, lack sharp discontinuities, and blend naturally with the surrounding terrain.",
      "question": "Do the mountain structures resemble large, intertwined roots with natural branching patterns, and do they maintain smooth transitions from base to tip without abrupt geometric breaks or unnatural color shifts?",

Vines should grow naturally from one building to another, following logical paths and maintaining consistent thickness and texture. We must check whether the vines appear physically grounded, do not clip through walls, and have realistic lighting and shadow integration.",
      "question": "Are the vines connecting the buildings uniformly textured, properly anchored at both ends, and free of floating segments or unnatural bends that violate plant growth logic?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of introducing colorful, ethereal bridges between buildings, this edit adds non-physical structures that must appear semi-transparent or glowing. These bridges should connect specific points on buildings without appearing suspended in midair or disconnected. We must ensure the bridges have consistent material properties (e.g., translucency, soft glow) and do not introduce jagged edges or rendering artifacts.",
      "question": "Do the bridges between buildings have smooth, glowing surfaces with no visible polygonal edges, and are they positioned so that they logically span between architectural supports without floating disconnectedly?",

The original boats are wooden and docked; the new airships should resemble leaves in form and texture, and hover above the water level with soft cloud support. We must evaluate whether the airships have natural leaf-like contours, are positioned above the water at a plausible height, and the clouds beneath them are softly diffused without hard edges.",
      "question": "Do the leaf-shaped airships have organic, vein-like textures and hover above the water at a height consistent with their size, with underlying clouds rendered as soft, pastel-colored masses without sharp outlines?",
