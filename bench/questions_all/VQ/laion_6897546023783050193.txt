Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction involves transforming a realistic stone statue into a ukiyo-e style artwork, which includes significant stylistic and material changes. This transformation affects multiple regions of the image: the robes, arms, face, and background sky. Each region must be evaluated for consistency with ukiyo-e aesthetics while maintaining structural coherence and avoiding unnatural artifacts. The original image shows a large stone statue of a figure with outstretched arms, draped robes, and a clear sky background. The editing requires flattening the robes into patterned cloth using indigo and gold, emphasizing arms with calligraphic lines, softening the facial features, and replacing the sky with stylized wave-like clouds. These changes involve altering textures, colors, shapes, and spatial relationships, so perceptual quality evaluation must focus on whether these transformations preserve visual plausibility and avoid distortions.

-Sub requirement 1: Evaluate whether the robes have been flattened into flowing patterned cloth using indigo and gold without introducing unnatural textures or loss of detail, ensuring that the fabric appears consistent with ukiyo-e artistic conventions while retaining the general shape and flow of the original drapery.

-Sub requirement 2: Assess whether the arms are emphasized with calligraphic lines in a way that maintains anatomical proportion and does not distort the hand structure (e.g., number of fingers, ergonomic shape), and whether the lines appear integrated naturally into the form rather than as superimposed artifacts.

-Sub requirement 3: Determine if the face has been rendered in soft, serene outlines consistent with ukiyo-e style, preserving facial proportions and avoiding distortion or loss of key features such as eyes, nose, and mouth, while ensuring the transition from stone texture to line art is smooth and plausible.

-Sub requirement 4: Check whether the sky has been replaced with stylized, wave-like clouds that maintain a coherent composition and do not introduce geometric inconsistencies or abrupt transitions with the statue, ensuring the ethereal atmosphere is achieved without visual dissonance.

-Sub requirement 5: Verify that the overall composition retains structural coherence—specifically, that the figure remains upright and balanced, with no misalignment between limbs, torso, and head—and that the interaction between the statue and the new background elements supports visual credibility.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the robes into flowing patterned cloth using indigo and gold, this question evaluates whether the texture and color application on the robes appear natural within the ukiyo-e style, avoiding patchy or inconsistent patterns, and whether the folds retain plausible flow despite being flattened.
Question: Are the robes depicted with consistent indigo and gold patterns that follow the contours of the original drapery without visible seams or unnatural texture breaks?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of emphasizing the arms with calligraphic lines, this question checks whether the lines are applied in a way that respects the arm’s anatomy and does not distort the hand or forearm, particularly focusing on finger count and joint alignment.
Question: Do the arms feature calligraphic lines that follow the natural curvature of the limbs without distorting the hands or creating more than five fingers per hand?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of rendering the face in soft, serene outlines, this question assesses whether the facial features remain recognizable and proportionate after stylization, and whether the transition from solid stone to line-based representation is smooth and free of jagged edges or missing details.
Question: Is the face composed of clean, continuous outlines that preserve the shape of the eyes, nose, and mouth without exaggerated or broken lines?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the sky with stylized, wave-like clouds, this question evaluates whether the new background integrates seamlessly with the statue, maintaining spatial coherence and avoiding abrupt edges or unnatural cloud formations.
Question: Are the wave-like clouds in the background smoothly blended with the statue's silhouette, without sharp boundaries or overlapping inconsistencies?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence and visual credibility, this question checks whether the entire figure remains upright and proportionally balanced, with limbs aligned correctly relative to the torso and head, and no floating or disconnected parts.
Question: Is the statue's posture stable, with arms symmetrically extended and the head centered above the torso, showing no signs of misalignment or deformation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
