Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the pyramid's steps into armored body segments, evaluate whether the geometric structure of the steps has been altered in a way that maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows clearly defined, symmetrical stone steps with consistent depth and alignment. Any transformation must preserve these proportions and avoid distortions such as uneven segmentation, misaligned edges, or broken geometry.
Question: Are the pyramid’s steps transformed into armored segments with consistent thickness, alignment, and geometric integrity, without visible breaks or unnatural warping?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the entrance into a mystical eye, assess whether the new eye feature integrates naturally with the surrounding architecture. The original entrance is a small rectangular opening near the top of the pyramid. The edited version should maintain plausible scale and placement while introducing organic eye-like features (e.g., iris, pupil) without disrupting the stonework texture or introducing artificial-looking materials.
Question: Is the entrance at the top of the pyramid replaced with an eye-like structure that matches the stone material and scale, without abrupt texture changes or floating elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of turning the surrounding jungle into intricate vine-like scales, evaluate whether the vegetation around the pyramid has been reimagined into a patterned, scale-like form that still appears natural and cohesive. The original jungle consists of dense green foliage. The edited version should show vine-like textures forming repeating patterns that resemble biological scales but remain visually plausible and not overly stylized or pixelated.
Question: Do the trees and foliage surrounding the pyramid transform into vine-like scales that follow natural growth patterns and maintain consistent texture and lighting, without unnatural sharp edges or disconnected patches?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of integrating ancient stone patterns into the creature’s base, assess whether the lower portion of the pyramid retains recognizable Mayan-style carvings or motifs that are seamlessly blended into the new form. The original base shows weathered stone blocks with faint relief details. The edited version should preserve these patterns while incorporating them into a larger, mythical design without distorting or erasing existing architectural features.
Question: Are ancient stone patterns preserved and integrated into the base of the pyramid-creature, maintaining continuity with original carvings and avoiding mismatched or floating decorative elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of surrounding the creature with luminescent flora inspired by temple details, evaluate whether the glowing plants introduced around the base emit light in a physically plausible manner. The original ground is grassy and shadowed. The added flora should glow softly, casting subtle illumination on nearby surfaces without creating harsh highlights, color bleeding, or unnatural brightness gradients.
Question: Do the luminescent plants around the base emit soft, localized light that interacts realistically with the environment, without overexposed areas or unnatural color spillage?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
