      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding a popcorn kernel in cozy autumn attire\" at the position near the jar of unpopped kernels (bottom left), evaluate whether the added character maintains natural texture and proportion relative to surrounding elements. The kernel should retain realistic corn-like surface details while incorporating clothing without distorting its shape or introducing unnatural textures.",
      "question": "Does the kernel wearing autumn attire maintain consistent size and texture with real corn kernels, and does the clothing appear seamlessly integrated without visible edges or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"bursting from the jar with cartoon energy lines\" at the central open jar (front center), assess whether the motion effect is visually coherent and physically plausible. The popcorn pieces should appear to be emerging naturally from the jar, with energy lines that do not break geometric continuity or introduce jagged artifacts.",
      "question": "Are the energy lines emanating from the popcorn pieces smooth and consistent with the direction of motion, and do they avoid intersecting or distorting the popcorn shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"a popcorn piece donning an explorer hat interacting with pumpkin and spices\" near the bowl of popped popcorn (right side), evaluate whether the explorer-hatted popcorn maintains structural integrity and material consistency. The hat and interaction with spices should not cause deformation or unnatural lighting.",
      "question": "Is the popcorn piece with the explorer hat properly scaled and textured, and do the spices and pumpkin elements adjacent to it appear naturally positioned without overlapping distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"a celebratory popcorn parade into ceramic bowls\" involving the two white bowls with blue rims (bottom left and right), assess whether the movement of popcorn into the bowls follows logical spatial flow. The popcorn should enter the bowls in a way that respects gravity and container boundaries without floating or clipping through surfaces.",
      "question": "Do the popcorn pieces entering the ceramic bowls follow a downward trajectory consistent with gravity, and do they remain within the bowl boundaries without appearing to float above or clip through the rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using \"vibrant oranges and browns\" throughout the scene, evaluate whether the color palette remains harmonious and free from abrupt transitions or unnatural saturation. The added whimsical elements should blend with the original warm tones without creating visual dissonance.",
      "question": "Are the colors of the added elements (such as hats, energy lines, and spices) consistent with the original orange-brown theme, and do they lack over-saturation or color bleeding at edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
