Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of maintaining the overall realism and natural appearance while transforming the character into a 3D chibi style, we need to assess if the character's new proportions and features still appear coherent and plausible within the context of the snow globe setting.
Question: Does the character's 3D chibi appearance maintain structural consistency and visual credibility without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement of ensuring the retained core elements ensure structural consistency and visual credibility, we need to evaluate if the snowy crag and surrounding miniature elements like tiny evergreen trees and mountains inside the snow globe retain their natural textures and shapes.
Question: Are the tiny evergreen trees and miniature mountain peaks inside the snow globe depicted with natural textures and shapes, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: To address the sub requirement of avoiding the introduction of artifacts such as unnatural textures and loss of details, we need to examine if the soft daylight filtering through the frosty window creates realistic icy reflections and gentle sparkles within the snow globe.
Question: Do the icy reflections and gentle sparkles created by the soft daylight filtering through the frosty window appear natural and free from unnatural artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the sub requirement of maintaining the overall sense of reality and natural appearance, we need to verify if the snow globe resting atop a stone pedestal near a frosty window integrates seamlessly with the snowy mountain range outside, preserving visual plausibility.
Question: Does the snow globe resting atop a stone pedestal near a frosty window integrate seamlessly with the snowy mountain range outside, maintaining visual plausibility without any obvious distortions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: In line with the sub requirement of ensuring the proportion and physical rationality of each element avoid distortion such as damaged geometric shapes, we need to confirm if the character's shield and sword retain their proper shapes and proportions within the 3D chibi style.
Question: Do the character's shield and sword retain their proper shapes and proportions within the 3D chibi style, avoiding any unnatural distortions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
