      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of extending geometric patterns into feathered wings, this transformation occurs primarily on the sides of the door where the carved panels meet the frame. The feathers must emerge naturally from the existing wood texture and follow the same light direction and material properties as the original door. Any deviation in scale, edge sharpness, or texture continuity would break realism.",
      "question": "Do the feathered wing extensions on the sides of the door maintain consistent wood grain and carving depth, with smooth transitions from the original panel edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of morphing the iron studs into shimmering eyes, the central vertical row of dark studs is the target area. The transformation must preserve their original spacing and alignment while adding reflective surfaces and organic contours resembling eyes. If the eyes appear misaligned, oversized, or detached from the door’s surface, it would violate structural consistency.",
      "question": "Are the shimmering eyes formed from the iron studs aligned with their original positions and embedded within the wood without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of evolving the arch into a celestial crown, the upper curved portion of the door is the focus. The crown must extend upward from the arch’s apex in a way that respects its original curvature and does not introduce jagged edges or disconnected segments. Lighting and shadow should remain consistent with the rest of the structure.",
      "question": "Does the celestial crown emerging from the arch maintain continuous curvature and seamless integration with the original arch shape, without broken lines or floating pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding etched runes across the wooden body, the runes must appear carved into the surface, following the same relief depth and lighting as the existing patterns. They should not overlay or obscure original designs but rather blend into them. Inconsistencies in depth or color would indicate poor integration.",
      "question": "Are the etched runes visible across the door’s surface consistent in depth, color, and lighting with the original carvings, and do they not cover or distort existing patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the doorframe into a cloak-like structure, the surrounding stonework and frame must transition into fabric folds. This change must respect the original thickness and shadows of the frame, with folds appearing volumetric and lit consistently. If the cloth appears flat, stretched unnaturally, or disconnected from the wall, it would lack visual credibility.",
      "question": "Does the cloak-like structure around the doorframe exhibit natural fabric folds with consistent lighting and shadow, and does it maintain connection to the original stone frame without gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
