      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the woman and child into cartoon form with enlarged eyes, evaluate whether the facial features—particularly the eyes—have been proportionally altered in a way that maintains visual credibility and avoids distortion. The original image shows realistic proportions; thus, any enlargement must not result in unnatural spacing, misalignment, or loss of anatomical coherence.",
      "question": "Are the eyes of the woman and child enlarged but still aligned with their facial structures without visible distortion or unnatural spacing?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding playful hand gestures, assess whether the hands of both figures maintain anatomical accuracy (e.g., correct number of fingers, natural joint positioning) and avoid deformation or clipping artifacts. The original image shows clearly defined hands in interaction; thus, any stylization should preserve ergonomic plausibility.",
      "question": "Do the hands of the woman and child show five fingers each, with natural finger curvature and no overlapping or missing digits?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of depicting the scene in soft watercolor tones, evaluate whether the color transitions across the entire image are smooth and consistent with watercolor aesthetics—such as subtle gradients, soft edges, and absence of harsh digital boundaries—without compromising the natural appearance of textures like skin, clothing, or foliage.",
      "question": "Are the color transitions across the woman’s dress, the child’s dress, and the background flowers smooth and free of sharp digital edges or unnatural blotches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding floral accents in the background for liveliness, evaluate whether these added elements are integrated seamlessly into the existing garden environment without disrupting spatial depth, perspective, or lighting consistency. The original background contains real flowers; new ones must match scale, shadow, and material properties.",
      "question": "Are the added floral accents in the background consistent in size, lighting, and texture with the existing flowers and do they cast plausible shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of framing the print with a warm wooden border, assess whether the frame appears physically plausible—consistent in thickness, grain, and color—with no visible seams, distortions, or mismatched edges around the image boundary. The frame must not interfere with the composition or create floating effects.",
      "question": "Does the wooden border have uniform thickness, natural wood grain, and proper alignment with the image edges without gaps or warping?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
