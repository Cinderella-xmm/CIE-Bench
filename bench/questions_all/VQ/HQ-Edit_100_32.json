Any exaggeration must preserve anatomical plausibility to avoid unnatural appearance.",
      "question": "Are the eyes, nose, and mouth aligned symmetrically and proportionally, with no distorted shapes such as stretched eyelids or misshapen lips?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of assessing the camera’s enlargement and metallic accents, this question evaluates whether the camera remains physically plausible in size relative to the hands and body, and whether the added metallic effects follow realistic material behavior.",
      "question": "Is the camera proportionally enlarged but still held securely by both hands without floating or unnatural grip angles, and do the metallic accents show consistent highlights and reflections?",

      "question": "Does the background gradient blend seamlessly with the subject’s edges, with no visible haloing, sharp cutoffs, or color bleeding?",
