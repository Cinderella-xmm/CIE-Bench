      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a transparent showcase box around the horse, evaluate whether the box maintains visual clarity and structural coherence. The box should encase the horse without distorting its form or introducing optical anomalies like ghosting, reflection errors, or incorrect transparency gradients. The edges of the box must align precisely with the horse’s silhouette.",
      "question": "Is the transparent showcase box fully aligned with the horse’s outline and free from visual distortions such as warped edges, double images, or unnatural light refractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating gold accents on the box, assess whether these elements exhibit realistic metallic properties. Gold accents should have consistent color, reflectivity, and thickness, matching typical premium packaging materials. They must not appear flat, overly shiny, or mismatched in tone with surrounding surfaces.",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the showcase box have uniform color and reflective properties consistent with polished metal, without unnatural highlights or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing a modern brand logo on the black base stand, evaluate whether the logo appears properly scaled, sharply rendered, and positioned without overlapping or clipping. The logo should not introduce jagged edges, low-resolution artifacts, or textural inconsistencies.",
      "question": "Is the brand logo clearly legible, properly centered on the black base stand, and free from pixelation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of inserting an ancient Chinese motif backdrop inside the box, assess whether the pattern is correctly placed within the depth of the box and maintains proper perspective. The design should not appear stretched, clipped, or misaligned with the box’s interior geometry.",
      "question": "Does the internal backdrop pattern follow the correct perspective of the box and avoid warping, tiling errors, or partial cutoffs at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of designing a magnetic closure for the box, evaluate whether the closure mechanism (e.g., hinge, seal, or flap) appears physically plausible and logically positioned. It should not create gaps, misalignments, or floating elements that violate structural logic.",
      "question": "Is the magnetic closure mechanism visibly integrated into the box structure without gaps, overlaps, or floating components that suggest mechanical impossibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving the original horse sculpture, assess whether its surface details—such as the mane, saddle, and red pigment traces—are unaltered and visible through the transparent box. The sculpture should not be obscured, distorted, or shadowed in a way that reduces perceived authenticity.",
      "question": "Are all visible parts of the horse sculpture (including the head, legs, saddle, and painted areas) clearly preserved and unobscured by the added packaging elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
