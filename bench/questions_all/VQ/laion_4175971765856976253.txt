Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a dynamic collectible packaging in isometric perspective labeled "DUAL TRANSFORMER HEROES", evaluate whether the newly added box structure maintains geometric consistency and visual plausibility. The editing position involves introducing a new 3D container around the existing toy figures, which must align with the spatial relationships of the car and robot forms in the original image. This requires checking for correct proportions, clean edges, and realistic shading to avoid unnatural depth or distortion.
Question: Does the isometric packaging box have consistent edges, proper depth cues, and accurate alignment with the toy figures without visible warping or misalignment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of featuring chibi-style versions of both the car and robot inside the box, assess whether the stylized figures maintain recognizable features from the original models while adhering to chibi proportions (large heads, small bodies). The editing position includes the interior of the box where these miniature figures are placed. Evaluate if their shapes are simplified but still coherent with the source designs and if they lack distorted limbs or disproportionate elements.
Question: Are the chibi-style figures inside the box proportionally consistent with typical chibi design rules (e.g., large heads, short limbs) and do they retain identifiable features of the original car and robot?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of including accessories such as a mini tool set, interchangeable helmets, and a gear base within the packaging, evaluate whether these small objects appear physically plausible and correctly scaled relative to the figures. The editing position includes the accessory area inside the box. Check for clarity in object shape, texture, and placementâ€”ensuring no floating items or overlapping that breaks spatial logic.
Question: Are the mini tool set, interchangeable helmets, and gear base clearly defined, properly scaled, and positioned without floating or clipping through other elements inside the box?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of displaying the figures outside the box with realistic textures for a lifelike appearance, evaluate whether the external figures retain high-resolution surface details such as reflections, material finish (metallic red and black), and smooth transitions between parts. The editing position includes the exterior surfaces of both the car and robot forms. Assess if textures appear uniform and free of pixelation, noise, or unnatural sheen.
Question: Do the external surfaces of the car and robot exhibit consistent metallic textures with natural highlights and reflections, without visible artifacts like blotches or jagged edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the figures in a polished showcase, evaluate whether the surrounding environment (e.g., glass-like surface, lighting, reflections) enhances realism without introducing inconsistencies. The editing position includes the base and background areas around the figures. Check for logical light sources, reflection symmetry, and absence of mismatched shadows or glossiness.
Question: Are the reflections and lighting on the showcase surface consistent with the direction of light and the materials of the figures, without unnatural glare or shadow mismatches?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
