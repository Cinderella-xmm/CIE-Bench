      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Considering the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility while designing the creature, we need to ensure that the creature's body proportions and shapes remain consistent with the tools and materials in the original image. This involves checking if the creature's form integrates naturally with the scissors, ruler, pen, and patterned paper.",
      "question": "Does the creature's body maintain structural coherence and visual plausibility, avoiding any unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "To evaluate the natural appearance and authenticity of the added elements, specifically focusing on the orb or capsule near the creature's feet, we need to ensure that its colors and patterns harmonize with the gridlines, beige paper, and metallic textures seen in the original image. This involves assessing whether the orb/capsule looks like it belongs in the scene without introducing any unnatural textures.",
      "question": "Does the orb or capsule near the creature's feet blend seamlessly with the surrounding elements, avoiding any unnatural textures or out-of-place patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The sub requirement emphasizes the avoidance of introducing artifacts and loss of details. When integrating the creature into the image, it's crucial to ensure that the fine details of the scissors, ruler, pen, and patterned paper are preserved and not degraded. This involves checking if the creature's design respects these details without causing any visual disruption.",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the scissors, ruler, pen, and patterned paper preserved, with no degradation or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The sub requirement focuses on maintaining the overall sense of reality and natural appearance. The creature's design should reflect the charm and functional aesthetics of the tools and materials in the original image. This involves verifying if the creature's design elements, such as its patterns and textures, align with the visual cues provided by the scissors, ruler, pen, and patterned paper.",
      "question": "Does the creature's design elements, such as patterns and textures, align with the visual cues from the scissors, ruler, pen, and patterned paper, contributing to a natural and authentic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The sub requirement highlights the importance of ensuring that the composition and layout of the elements have visual credibility. The placement of the creature, the orb/capsule, and the text displaying the creature's name and elemental type should be coherent and visually plausible within the context of the original image.",
      "question": "Is the composition and layout of the creature, the orb/capsule, and the text displaying the creature's name and elemental type visually credible and well-integrated into the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
