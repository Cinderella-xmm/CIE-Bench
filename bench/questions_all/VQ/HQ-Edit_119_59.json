      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the weightlifter into a cartoon style with exaggerated arms, evaluate whether the arm proportions and musculature remain structurally coherent and visually credible despite exaggeration. The original image shows well-defined, anatomically accurate muscles; thus, any exaggeration must preserve basic human anatomy to avoid unnatural distortions such as elongated limbs or misshapen joints.",
      "question": "Do the exaggerated arms maintain anatomical plausibility with visible muscle groups that follow natural contours and joint alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the attire to include gym-themed motifs in a cartoon style, assess whether the added patterns on the tank top and shorts are integrated seamlessly without disrupting fabric texture or material consistency. The original clothing has clean lines and realistic fabric folds; thus, any motif addition must not introduce texture conflicts or visual noise.",
      "question": "Are the gym-themed motifs on the tank top and shorts clearly rendered with consistent material properties and no overlapping or fragmented textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the barbell weights with colorful icons, evaluate whether the replacement maintains spatial logic and physical plausibility. The original barbell has symmetrical, circular plates with defined edges and metallic sheen; replacing them with icons must preserve the bar's balance and structural integrity while avoiding floating or misaligned elements.",
      "question": "Are the colorful icons positioned symmetrically on both sides of the barbell and aligned with the barâ€™s axis without appearing detached or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of filling the mirror reflection with creative shadow illustrations instead of a realistic reflection, assess whether the shadows are artistically coherent and do not conflict with the surrounding environment. The original mirror reflects a clear, logical image; introducing abstract shadows must not break depth perception or create inconsistent lighting effects.",
      "question": "Do the shadow illustrations in the mirror maintain consistent lighting direction and depth relative to the main subject and surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a detachable calendar strip at the bottom of the wooden panel, evaluate whether the strip is proportionally scaled and physically plausible within the composition. The original image has a flat floor surface; adding a calendar must not interfere with perspective or appear suspended unnaturally.",
      "question": "Is the calendar strip aligned horizontally along the bottom edge of the panel and sized appropriately to match the scale of the figure and surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
