      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enhancing the beadwork on the bride’s shoulder straps, this edit targets the intricate beaded design visible on her upper arm and shoulder area in the original image. The question evaluates whether the enhanced beadwork retains natural texture and spatial consistency with the surrounding fabric, avoiding pixelation, over-sharpness, or floating elements that would break realism.",
      "question": "Are the enhanced beads on the bride's shoulder straps evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the fabric's surface without appearing detached or unnaturally sharp?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enlarging the groom’s suit lapel, this edit focuses on the left side of his jacket where the lapel meets the collar and boutonnière. The question checks whether the enlarged lapel maintains proportional relationship with the rest of the suit, particularly the collar and pocket square, and whether the edge remains smooth and geometrically sound.",
      "question": "Is the enlarged lapel of the groom's suit proportionally consistent with the rest of the jacket, and does it retain a smooth edge without jagged lines or distorted angles?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding action presets such as holding hands, this edit introduces new hand positioning between the couple. The original image shows the bride’s right hand resting on the groom’s waist, so any change to a \"holding hands\" pose must ensure proper finger count, joint alignment, and skin texture continuity. This question evaluates anatomical correctness and natural posture.",
      "question": "Do the hands in the \"holding hands\" pose have five fingers each, correctly aligned joints, and natural skin texture without distortion or overlapping limbs?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of framing the image in a gold-trimmed, heart-shaped border on a cream envelope with floral engravings, this edit adds an external decorative element around the couple. The question assesses whether the border is cleanly rendered, properly aligned with the subject, and does not clip into or obscure parts of the figures or their clothing.",
      "question": "Is the heart-shaped border fully contained around the couple without cutting into their bodies or clothing, and are the gold trim and floral engravings clearly defined without blurring or misalignment?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of cartoonizing the couple with exaggerated details, this edit applies stylistic changes to both figures. The question evaluates whether the overall style shift maintains visual coherence—such as consistent line thickness, shading direction, and material representation—without introducing conflicting textures (e.g., overly flat areas next to hyper-detailed ones).",
      "question": "Are the cartoonized features of both the bride and groom uniformly stylized, with consistent line work and shading that do not clash with each other or create abrupt transitions in texture?",
