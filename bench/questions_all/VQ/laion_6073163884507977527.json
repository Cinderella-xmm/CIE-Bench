      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a transparent glass dome over the entire scene, evaluate whether the dome is rendered with appropriate transparency, minimal distortion, and consistent lighting interaction. The dome must not warp the house, tree, or ground beneath it, nor introduce artificial reflections or shadows that break realism.",
      "question": "Does the glass dome cover the entire scene without distorting the underlying elements such as the house, tree, or ground?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding mossy green pathways, assess whether the new moss paths are integrated with the existing ground texture and elevation. The transition between moss and surrounding cork-like material must be smooth, with no sharp edges or color mismatches.",
      "question": "Are the mossy green pathways aligned with the terrain level and blended naturally with the surrounding ground texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding tiny shrubs, check whether the new shrubs match the scale and appearance of existing vegetation. They should not appear oversized or clustered in unnatural patterns, and their leaf texture should be consistent with the rest of the foliage.",
      "question": "Do the newly added shrubs have a size and texture consistent with the existing plants in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of inserting a lake with a shimmering silver surface, verify that the lake has defined edges, realistic depth, and reflects light appropriately. It must not appear flat or disconnected from the terrain, and its position should allow logical access via the bridge.",
      "question": "Is the lake positioned on the ground with defined edges and a reflective surface that interacts realistically with surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of weaving fairy lights around the tree, determine whether the lights follow the natural branching pattern and emit a soft glow without creating bright halos or overexposed areas. The lights should not obscure the tree's structure.",
      "question": "Are the fairy lights wrapped around the tree branches in a way that follows their shape and emits a soft, uniform glow without harsh highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing a small bridge across the lake, evaluate whether the bridge connects two solid land masses, maintains consistent width and height, and has supports that appear structurally sound. It must not float or tilt unnaturally.",
      "question": "Does the bridge span the lake with stable supports and connect directly to the ground on both sides without floating or tilting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining stylistic and material coherence, assess whether all added elements (dome, lake, bridge, lights) share a consistent visual language. The materials should not clash—e.g., metallic-looking bridge on a wooden-style house—and the lighting should be harmonious.",
      "question": "Are all added elements (dome, lake, bridge, lights) rendered with materials and lighting that match the rustic, natural aesthetic of the original scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
