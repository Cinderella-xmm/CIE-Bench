      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding cutout windows to reveal internal chocolate layers, this edit affects the surface integrity of each tier. The cutouts must align with the internal chocolate drops and not create broken or incomplete edges. The goal is to preserve the illusion of solid chocolate with transparent sections revealing content inside. The question evaluates whether the cutouts have clean, geometrically consistent edges and do not introduce gaps or irregularities that suggest poor rendering.",
      "question": "Are the cutout windows on each tier aligned with the chocolate drops and have smooth, uninterrupted edges without jagged or fragmented borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying gold foiling, the foil must appear as a thin, reflective layer over the chocolate surface. The original image already includes gold foil on some nuts and drops, so extending this to other areas must maintain visual continuity. The question checks for unnatural shine, inconsistent reflectivity, or patchy coverage that would indicate a poorly rendered texture.",
      "question": "Does the gold foiling applied across the surface show uniform reflectivity and smooth transitions without visible seams, pixelation, or overly bright spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding intricate nut embellishments, the nuts must be physically plausible—correctly shaped, sized, and textured—and placed in a way that suggests they are part of the chocolate structure. The original image includes nuts within the drops, so new external nuts must match this style. The question assesses whether the nuts appear anchored to the chocolate and not floating or misaligned.",
      "question": "Are the nut embellishments attached to the chocolate surface with natural positioning, showing correct shadows and depth, and no floating or misplaced instances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of introducing a subtle sparkle effect, the sparkles must enhance the festive look without overwhelming the image. They should be small, scattered, and softly lit, resembling light reflection on a glossy surface. The question evaluates whether the sparkle effect appears as natural light diffusion rather than artificial glitter or noise.",
      "question": "Are the sparkle effects evenly distributed and faint enough to resemble light reflections on chocolate, without forming clusters or sharp, unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the base text and adding seasonal motifs, the new branding must be clearly legible and stylistically harmonious with the deep brown color scheme. The motifs must be proportionally sized and integrated without overlapping or distorting the base ring. The question checks whether the text and motifs are properly aligned and visually cohesive.",
      "question": "Is the new text “ChocoConifer Delights” clearly readable, properly spaced, and integrated into the base without overlapping or distorting the surrounding chocolate ring or motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the overall shape and proportions, the tower must retain its conical tapering structure even after edits. Any stretching, compression, or misalignment of tiers would compromise visual credibility. The question assesses whether the vertical alignment and spacing between tiers remain consistent and geometrically accurate.",
      "question": "Are the tiers of the tower evenly spaced and aligned vertically, preserving the original conical shape without bulging, shrinking, or skewed angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
