      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Considering the sub requirement of ensuring the overall authenticity and natural appearance during the transformation to a 3D-style image, it's essential to evaluate if the kitten's body, positioned centrally in the image, maintains its structural coherence and avoids any distortion or unnatural textures.",
      "question": "Does the kitten's body appear structurally consistent without any unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the natural appearance and avoiding obvious artifacts, we must ensure that the texture of the fur, especially near the kitten’s face, looks genuine and retains fine details after the 3D-style transformation.",
      "question": "Are the fur details around the kitten’s face natural and free from any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "To align with the sub requirement of preserving the visual plausibility and avoiding broken geometric shapes, it's important to assess if the perspective and positioning of the kitten create a believable illusion of depth for the 3D effect while maintaining realistic proportions.",
      "question": "Does the kitten's position and perspective accurately simulate a 3D jumps-out effect without breaking its geometric shapes or distorting its proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Considering the sub requirement to maintain a sense of reality and natural appearance, it is crucial to verify that the material aspects of the surrounding elements, like the fuzzy blue blanket, remain visually credible post-editing and contribute positively to the overall scene.",
      "question": "Do the material properties of the blue blanket around the kitten look natural, supporting the 3D illusion without introducing any artificial artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The sub requirement of ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility necessitates confirming that the kitten’s paws maintain their natural shape and position, even with the added 3D effect. This ensures the action depicted is plausible.",
      "question": "Are the kitten's paws shaped naturally, consistently placed, and free from any distortion or unrealistic deformations after applying the 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
