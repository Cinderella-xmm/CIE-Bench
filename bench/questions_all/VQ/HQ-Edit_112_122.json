      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the woman's dress into a semi-cartoon style with enlarged floral patterns, evaluate whether the texture and pattern details of the dress maintain visual coherence and avoid unnatural distortions. The original image shows a flowing red and blue gown with realistic fabric folds; thus, any stylization must preserve structural integrity while introducing cartoonish elements without breaking geometric logic or creating inconsistent textures.",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the dress clearly defined, proportionally consistent with the garment’s scale, and free from jagged edges or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering ethereal lighting from the top right, assess whether the light source direction is consistently applied across all elements—especially the woman’s hair, dress, and surrounding flowers—and whether shadows and highlights follow natural illumination rules. The original image already features dynamic lighting, so the edited version must maintain plausible light interaction without artificial glow or misplaced brightness.",
      "question": "Does the lighting from the top right cast soft gradients on the woman’s face, dress, and nearby flowers without causing unnatural overexposure or disconnected highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding whimsical petal and floral embellishments, determine if these floating petals are physically plausible in terms of motion, size, and distribution. In the original image, petals appear to drift naturally; the edited version should not introduce clumped, overlapping, or unnaturally suspended particles that break visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are the floating petals distributed evenly in mid-air, showing natural dispersion and depth, with no clustered or floating-in-place anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of including a blank writing area framed by floral vines, evaluate whether this added element integrates seamlessly into the scene. The frame must be structurally coherent—vines should grow logically from existing flora, follow natural curvature, and not clash with background depth or perspective.",
      "question": "Do the floral vines forming the writing area extend naturally from surrounding plants, maintaining consistent thickness, color, and growth direction without abrupt starts or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the overall style to semi-cartoon while preserving core elements like the woman’s pose and dress structure, assess whether her body proportions remain anatomically sound. Specifically, check her hands and limbs for correct finger count, joint alignment, and skin texture continuity, especially as movement may affect limb appearance.",
      "question": "Does the woman’s left hand show five distinct fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and does the hand appear attached correctly to the arm without distortion?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
