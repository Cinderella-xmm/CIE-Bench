Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction involves transforming the original image of a bear catching a salmon into a two-panel educational comic. This requires significant changes to the scene: adding elements like spectacles and a speech bubble on the bear in Panel 1, modifying the bear’s expression and posture to resemble an elder guide, and introducing a transformation chart with labeled stages of salmon development in Panel 2. These edits involve both style modification (e.g., cartoonish or illustrative elements) and structural additions. The original image features a realistic bear in a natural forest environment with high detail in fur, water, and foliage. Therefore, any added elements must maintain visual coherence with the original realism while transitioning into an educational format. The key perceptual quality concerns are whether added elements (like glasses, speech bubbles, text, and diagrams) appear seamlessly integrated without distorting existing structures, introducing unnatural textures, or breaking geometric consistency. Additionally, color fidelity must be preserved—especially blue for water-related stages and brown-green for forest areas—to maintain natural appearance.

-Sub requirement 1: Adding spectacles to the bear's face—does this modification preserve facial structure and avoid distortion such as unnatural eye shape or misaligned lenses?  
-Sub requirement 2: Altering the bear’s expression to a wise, elderly demeanor—does this change maintain anatomical plausibility and avoid unnatural facial deformation?  
-Sub requirement 3: Introducing a speech bubble near the bear—does it align properly with the bear’s mouth position and avoid overlapping or obscuring key details like fur or water splash?  
-Sub requirement 4: Replacing the salmon in the bear’s mouth with a diagrammatic representation showing life cycle stages—does this replacement maintain spatial logic and avoid disrupting the bear’s jaw or mouth geometry?  
-Sub requirement 5: Adding a transformation chart with labeled stages (egg, fry, smolt, adult)—does this overlay respect depth cues and avoid floating or misaligned labels?  
-Sub requirement 6: Including a fact box with text—does the placement avoid visual clutter and ensure legibility without interfering with natural elements like trees or water?  
-Sub requirement 7: Using a modern sans-serif font—does the text appear crisp, readable, and consistent with the image’s resolution and lighting?  
-Sub requirement 8: Maintaining realistic color fidelity—do blue hues for water stages and brown-green for forest background remain consistent with original tones and not introduce chromatic aberration or color bleeding?  
-Sub requirement 9: Preserving fine details such as fur texture, water droplets, and leaf patterns—do these remain intact despite overlays and modifications?  
-Sub requirement 10: Ensuring overall composition follows 16:9 aspect ratio—does the layout balance both panels without cropping or stretching core elements?

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding spectacles to the bear's face, this edit affects facial anatomy. The spectacles must fit naturally over the bear’s eyes without distorting the eye shape, altering fur around the snout, or creating unnatural reflections or shadows. The material of the lenses should appear transparent and consistent with light interaction in the scene.
Question: Are the spectacles positioned correctly over the bear’s eyes without deforming the surrounding fur or causing unnatural lens reflections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of changing the bear’s expression to a wise, elder-like demeanor, this involves modifying facial muscles and wrinkles. The edit must not cause unnatural creases, disproportionate features, or asymmetry that breaks anatomical plausibility.
Question: Does the bear’s facial expression show subtle aging features (like wrinkles) without distorting the nose, mouth, or jawline geometry?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a speech bubble near the bear’s mouth, this element must originate from the correct point (mouth area) and avoid overlapping critical details like fur or water splash. It should also have clean edges and proper shadowing to blend into the scene.
Question: Is the speech bubble clearly connected to the bear’s mouth and does it not obscure or distort nearby fur or water details?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the salmon in the bear’s mouth with a transformation chart, this edit alters the bear’s jaw contents. The new graphic must fit within the mouth cavity without extending beyond natural boundaries or causing visible gaps or warping in the bear’s teeth or gums.
Question: Does the transformation chart fit naturally within the bear’s mouth without exceeding jaw limits or causing visible deformations in the mouth structure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding labeled life cycle stages (egg, fry, smolt, adult) in a chart format, this involves placing graphical elements in space. These must align with perspective cues and avoid floating above the river or forest floor without grounding.
Question: Are the labeled stages in the transformation chart aligned with the river surface and do they cast appropriate shadows or depth cues consistent with the scene?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of including a fact box with text, this element must be placed where it doesn’t interfere with key visual elements like trees or the bear. The text must be legible and its background must not disrupt natural textures.
Question: Is the fact box positioned in an open area of the image (e.g., near the riverbank) without covering important details like tree trunks or water flow?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q7: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using a modern sans-serif font, the text must appear sharp and consistent with the image resolution. It should not blur, pixelate, or have jagged edges, especially under bright lighting conditions.
Question: Is the text in the speech bubble and fact box rendered with clean edges and no pixelation or aliasing artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q8: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining realistic color fidelity, particularly blue for water stages and brown-green for forest background, the added elements must match the original palette. Color shifts or unnatural saturation could break visual coherence.
Question: Do the blue hues in the transformation chart and the brown-green tones in the forest background match the original image’s color grading without noticeable shifts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q9: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving fine details like fur texture and water droplets, the addition of graphics should not erase or blur these features. For example, the bear’s fur should still show individual strands even near overlaid elements.
Question: Are the bear’s fur strands and water splashes still visible and detailed around the added speech bubble and transformation chart?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q10: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining a 16:9 aspect ratio, the final composition must not stretch or crop key elements. Both panels should fit proportionally without truncating the bear, river, or trees.
Question: Do both panels occupy their intended regions within the 16:9 frame without cutting off the bear’s legs or the tree line at the edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
