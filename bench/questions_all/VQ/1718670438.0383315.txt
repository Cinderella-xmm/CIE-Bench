Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a glass bell jar around the robot, evaluate whether the transparency and surface reflections of the glass are consistent with real-world physics and do not introduce unnatural distortions or artifacts. The position involves the entire outer boundary of the robot, where the glass should enclose it without altering its shape or causing visible warping.
Question: Does the glass bell jar surrounding the robot have clear, smooth surfaces with natural reflections and refractions that do not distort the robot’s structure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the robot on a small, cog-adorned pedestal, assess whether the pedestal is proportionally scaled relative to the robot and physically plausible in terms of support and design. The editing position is beneath the robot’s feet, where the pedestal must align with the robot’s base and maintain structural coherence.
Question: Is the pedestal under the robot properly aligned, proportionally sized, and made of materials consistent with the steampunk theme (e.g., brass, copper) without visible seams or deformation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of surrounding the robot with miniature clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils, evaluate whether these elements are realistically integrated into the scene—specifically checking for correct scale, material consistency, and spatial placement. The editing position includes the area around the robot's base within the jar.
Question: Are the miniature clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils positioned at a plausible scale and orientation around the robot, with natural textures and no floating or disconnected parts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding tiny glowing orbs as decorative accents, determine if the orbs are visually coherent—properly lit, with soft glow effects that do not create harsh halos or unrealistic light leaks. The editing position is within the space inside the jar near the robot and gadgets.
Question: Do the glowing orbs emit a soft, localized glow that blends naturally with the ambient lighting and does not produce unnatural light artifacts or overexposed areas?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of etching intricate steampunk patterns on the jar's base, assess whether the patterns are clearly defined, stylistically consistent with the rest of the scene, and applied without smudging or distortion. The editing position is the lower part of the glass jar.
Question: Are the etched patterns on the base of the glass jar sharp, detailed, and stylistically coherent with the steampunk aesthetic, without blurring or irregular lines?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of changing the backdrop to a rusted metal texture harmonizing with the robot’s antique bronze tones, evaluate whether the new background maintains visual continuity with the robot’s color palette and avoids abrupt transitions or texture mismatches. The editing position is the wall behind the robot.
Question: Does the rusted metal background match the color and texture of the robot’s materials and blend seamlessly without visible edges or tonal inconsistencies?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
