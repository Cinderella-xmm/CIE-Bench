      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the elderly gentleman into a cartoon form while preserving anatomical accuracy, this question evaluates whether the hands show the correct number of fingers (five per hand), natural finger spacing, and ergonomic positioning when holding the newspaper. It checks for deformations such as extra fingers, missing digits, or bent joints that defy biomechanics.",
      "question": "Do both hands of the elderly gentleman have exactly five fingers each, with natural spacing and joint alignment consistent with human anatomy?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of making the newspaper oversized and replacing text with illustrated content, this question assesses whether the scale of the newspaper is physically plausible relative to the man’s body—specifically, whether it can realistically rest on his lap and be held by his hands without appearing disproportionately large or floating unnaturally.",
      "question": "Is the size of the newspaper proportionate to the man’s body such that it rests naturally on his lap and is fully supported by his hands without appearing to float or exceed physical plausibility?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a blank thought bubble near the man’s head, this question evaluates whether the thought bubble is positioned in a way that avoids overlapping with facial features or clothing, has smooth, continuous edges, and follows standard cartoon conventions for shape and placement.",
      "question": "Is the thought bubble placed adjacent to the man’s head without overlapping any part of his face or hair, and does it have a smooth, closed outline without jagged or broken edges?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of simplifying the park background into cartoon-style graphics, this question checks whether the trees and grass retain coherent geometric forms—such as straight trunks, symmetrical canopies, and evenly spaced foliage—without warping, floating elements, or fragmented textures that suggest digital artifacts.",
      "question": "Are the tree trunks and foliage in the background rendered with consistent, non-warped geometry and uniform texture, without floating leaves or broken shapes?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying a textured cardstock effect and soft pastel accents, this question evaluates whether the surface texture appears uniformly applied across the image without obscuring fine details such as facial features, clothing folds, or newspaper illustrations. It also checks if the pastel coloring enhances the scene without causing unnatural color bleeding or loss of contrast.",
      "question": "Is the textured cardstock effect visible across the entire image without distorting fine details like facial lines, clothing seams, or newspaper content, and are the pastel colors evenly distributed without causing color bleed or shadowing?",
