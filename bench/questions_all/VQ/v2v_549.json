      "question": "Does the chibi-style Funko Pop figure maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the baseball player's pose and attire without introducing unnatural distortions?",

      "thinking_process": "To address the sub requirement of avoiding the introduction of artifacts such as unnatural textures and loss of details, we need to check if the transition between the chibi-style figure and the realistic depiction introduces any unnatural textures or loss of fine details.",
      "question": "Is there an absence of unnatural textures or loss of fine details where the chibi-style figure transitions to the realistic depiction of the figure outside the box?",
