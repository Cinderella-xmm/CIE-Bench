Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires replacing the stone texture of the entire castle with wooden puzzle pieces made of natural oak and mahogany. This involves a full material transformation across all visible surfaces of the structure, including towers, walls, windows, and architectural details. The original image shows a detailed stone castle with defined textures, window frames, and structural joints. Replacing these with wood puzzle pieces must preserve the original geometry and proportions while introducing new material characteristics. The key perceptual quality concerns are whether the transition from stone to wood maintains structural coherence, avoids unnatural textures or seams, and retains visual plausibility in terms of material consistency and lighting interaction.
-Sub requirement 1: Replace the stone texture of the castle’s exterior (including towers, walls, and architectural features) with interlocking wooden puzzle pieces made of oak and mahogany, ensuring the material substitution does not introduce artificial seams, color inconsistencies, or loss of fine detail.
-Sub requirement 2: Maintain the original architectural form and proportions of the castle, especially in the two towers, central archway, and surrounding wall sections, to ensure structural consistency and avoid geometric distortion.
-Sub requirement 3: Ensure the tower tops feature intricate interlocking wooden puzzle details that appear physically plausible and consistent with the rest of the structure, without floating or misaligned elements.
-Sub requirement 4: Position the entire scene on a smooth wooden tabletop, which must be visually integrated with the castle base and reflect realistic lighting and shadow interactions, avoiding abrupt transitions or unnatural grounding.
-Sub requirement 5: Preserve the natural appearance of the materials by ensuring the wood grain, color variation, and lighting response (such as reflections and shadows) are consistent with real oak and mahogany, avoiding synthetic or overly uniform textures.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the stone texture with wooden puzzle pieces, this question evaluates whether the material transformation at the castle's exterior (towers, walls, windows, and base) maintains natural wood appearance without introducing unnatural textures, such as repetitive patterns, inconsistent grain, or mismatched color patches. The focus is on the visual authenticity of the wood material across all surfaces.
Question: Are the wooden puzzle pieces covering the castle's exterior uniformly textured with natural oak and mahogany variations, showing no repeating patterns or artificial seams?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the original architectural form, this question checks whether the structural geometry of the towers, central archway, and connecting walls remains intact after material replacement. The goal is to ensure no warping, stretching, or collapse of shapes due to editing, preserving visual credibility.
Question: Do the towers, archway, and surrounding walls retain their original shape and proportions without any geometric distortion or misalignment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of intricate interlocking details on the tower tops, this question assesses whether the top edges of both towers display clearly defined, interlocking wooden puzzle joints that appear physically plausible and structurally sound, rather than floating or broken pieces.
Question: Are the top edges of both towers composed of clearly interlocked wooden puzzle pieces with no gaps, floating fragments, or disconnected segments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the scene on a smooth wooden tabletop, this question evaluates whether the base of the castle is seamlessly grounded on a flat, continuous wooden surface that matches the material style and lighting of the structure, avoiding abrupt transitions or unnatural shadows.
Question: Is the castle resting on a smooth, continuous wooden surface that matches the wood type and finish of the puzzle pieces, with consistent lighting and shadow under the base?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving natural material appearance, this question checks whether the lighting interaction with the wooden surface—such as reflections, highlights, and shadows—is consistent with real wood, particularly in areas like the water reflection and base of the structure, to ensure realism.
Question: Do the reflections in the water and shadows beneath the castle show accurate interaction with the wooden surface, with no unnatural glare, color shifts, or floating reflections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
