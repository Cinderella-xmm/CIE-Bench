Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the instruction to make the wall painting appear three-dimensional and blend into the real space, we must assess if the transition between the painting and the wall maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility while avoiding unnatural artifacts or distortions. 
Question: Does the transition area between the painting and the wall maintain the natural texture of the wall material without introducing obvious artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q2: 
Thinking process: The painting should emerge with a 3D effect. This implies examining if the proportions and physical dimensions of the elements within the painting remain realistic after blending into the space. 
Question: Are the proportions of the trees and water in the painting maintained realistically without appearing stretched or distorted?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q3: 
Thinking process: To achieve a seamless blend of the painting into the real space, the lighting and shadows in the painting should naturally interact with the room's ambient light. 
Question: Do the shadows and lighting in the painting align consistently with the room's light source, avoiding unnatural contrasts or disruptions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q4: 
Thinking process: The editing instruction emphasizes a 3D effect, which means assessing the depth and layering of the painting post-editing. This requires evaluating if the painting retains its depth as intended.
Question: Does the painting preserve its depth and layering, creating a believable 3D effect without disrupting its visual coherence?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q5: 
Thinking process: Making the painting pop out of the frame requires ensuring that the frame itself doesn't lose structural integrity or appear unnatural during the blending process. 
Question: Does the frame around the painting retain its structural integrity and material appearance without visible damage or unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
