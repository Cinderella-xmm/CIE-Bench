      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to transform the fox mask into a stylized Art Deco form with geometric shapes and bold lines, this question evaluates whether the facial structure of the mask retains coherent proportions and symmetry after editing. Specifically, it checks if the eyes, nose, and mouth area maintain natural alignment and avoid distortion such as stretched or warped features, which could compromise visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are the facial features of the fox mask (eyes, nose, mouth) aligned symmetrically and proportionally, without any stretched or deformed areas?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to simplify floral patterns into stylized motifs, this question assesses whether the floral designs on the kimono have been converted into geometric, symmetrical patterns without losing structural clarity or introducing unnatural textures. It focuses on the pattern continuity and edge definition.",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the kimono replaced with clean, geometric motifs that follow consistent lines and shapes, without blurred or fragmented edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to apply a color palette of deep reds, pale pinks, and metallics, this question evaluates whether the colors are applied uniformly and harmoniously across both the mask and kimono, without abrupt transitions or unnatural color patches that would suggest poor blending or artifacting.",
      "question": "Do the colors on the kimono and mask transition smoothly between deep reds, pale pinks, and metallic tones without visible color bleeding or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to maintain overall silhouette and composition, this question checks whether the figure's posture and garment shape remain structurally consistent after editing. It ensures that the kimono drapes naturally and that no parts appear unnaturally flattened or distorted due to stylization.",
      "question": "Does the kimono retain a natural drape and fold structure, with no unnatural flattening or stretching of fabric that would disrupt physical plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to avoid artifacts such as jagged edges or texture misalignment, this question evaluates the surface quality of the edited mask and kimono. It checks for signs of digital artifacts like pixelation, seam breaks, or inconsistent material rendering that would indicate low perceptual quality.",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the fox mask and kimono free from jagged edges, pixelation, or texture seams that suggest incomplete rendering or editing errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
