      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the tree's leaves with luminescent ferns, evaluate whether the new foliage maintains a natural appearance in terms of shape, texture, and color consistency with the surrounding environment. The original tree has dense, rounded red foliage; replacing it with fern-like structures must preserve visual coherence without introducing unnatural textures or clumping.",
      "question": "Do the luminescent ferns in the canopy have consistent, organic shapes and smooth gradients that resemble real plant growth patterns without pixelation or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding intricate silver tribal patterns to the bark, assess whether the patterns integrate naturally into the tree’s trunk structure without appearing overlaid, distorted, or violating anatomical plausibility. The original trunk is thick and solid, so any added design should follow its curvature and surface topology.",
      "question": "Are the silver tribal patterns on the bark aligned with the natural contours of the trunk and free from floating, misaligned, or unnaturally sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the canopy into translucent, shimmering wings, evaluate whether the wing-like structures maintain structural integrity and plausible physics—such as symmetry, translucency gradient, and connection to the trunk—without appearing broken or disjointed from the rest of the tree.",
      "question": "Are the translucent wings extending from the canopy smoothly connected to the tree’s branches, showing gradual transparency and consistent layering without visible seams or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the trunk with twisting glass-like fibers, assess whether the new material appears cohesive and physically plausible—considering light refraction, continuity, and structural support—while avoiding artificial textures or unnatural bending.",
      "question": "Do the glass-like fibers forming the trunk exhibit realistic light refraction, consistent thickness variation, and continuous flow without abrupt breaks or unnatural twists?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating glowing vine-like tendrils at the base extending into the ground, evaluate whether these tendrils emerge naturally from the base of the tree, follow plausible underground paths, and interact credibly with the grassy field without clipping through terrain or appearing flat/textureless.",
      "question": "Do the glowing tendrils extend from the tree base into the ground with smooth curvature and consistent luminosity, without intersecting the grass unnaturally or showing flat, non-continuous surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
