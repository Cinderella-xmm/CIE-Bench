      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the two boys into cartoon characters with specific hairstyles (curly hair and bald), evaluate whether the transformation of their facial features, head shapes, and proportions maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows a boy with short brown hair and another with a shaved head; altering these to stylized cartoon forms must preserve anatomical consistency and avoid unnatural distortions such as elongated heads or misshapen ears.",
      "question": "Do the cartoon versions of the two boys have proportionally correct head shapes and facial features that align with typical human anatomy, without exaggerated or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the classroom furniture colors to bright cyan and lemon yellow, assess whether the color changes affect the material appearance and texture of the tables and chairs. In the original image, the furniture has natural wood tones and standard schoolroom textures. Replacing them with vibrant hues should not introduce unnatural sheens, inconsistent lighting, or disrupted surface patterns.",
      "question": "Are the cyan and lemon yellow furniture elements rendered with consistent material textures and lighting that match the surrounding environment, avoiding glossy or flat-painted artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding floating books and animated tablet screens, evaluate whether these new elements are integrated naturally into the scene. The original image includes a real tablet being held by one child; transforming it into an animated screen with motion effects must not break physical laws or create visual inconsistencies such as floating objects without support or incorrect shadows.",
      "question": "Are the floating books and animated tablet screen positioned in a way that respects spatial depth and casting appropriate shadows, ensuring they appear physically plausible within the classroom setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating friendly robots and fun gadgets hovering around the children, assess whether these added elements conform to ergonomic design and realistic scale relative to the children. The original image contains no such objects, so inserting them requires checking for proper size ratios, smooth contours, and absence of jagged edges or pixelation.",
      "question": "Are the robots and gadgets placed at appropriate scales and distances from the children, with smooth surfaces and no visible digital artifacts like aliasing or missing textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using a bold, cheerful font for the title \"A Classroom Adventure\" at the top, evaluate whether the text is legible, stylistically consistent with the whimsical theme, and properly aligned without overlapping or distorting other elements. The placement at the top of the image should not obscure key visual content or disrupt the composition.",
      "question": "Is the title text clearly readable, positioned at the top without overlapping critical elements, and styled with clean lines and uniform thickness that match the playful aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
