Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the editing instruction does not apply to the current image but if we were to add motion elements like skater's trajectory against this beach scene, we'd assess the addition's impact on naturalism.
Question: If motion trajectory lines were added around the horse, would they appear naturally integrated with the environment without disrupting the image's authenticity?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Given the current image doesnâ€™t involve a skater, but focusing on the context if one was introduced, ensuring realistic integration would be key.
Question: If a skater was added near the house in the background, would the scale and perspective match the existing scene correctly, maintaining structural consistency?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Evaluating the naturalness of any additional elements such as a skater's motion sequence demands checking for visual plausibility.
Question: If the skater's three motion phases were imposed over the sea and land, would the transitions between these phases look smooth without introducing artifacts or unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: An important aspect while adding elements like skaters in motion would be to ensure that fine details and material textures remain unaffected.
Question: Would the details of the horse's fur texture and the surrounding grass remain visually coherent and undistorted after adding the skater's motion trajectory?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Considering the addition of motion elements, it's vital to confirm that the overall composition retains its visual credibility.
Question: If the skater's starting motion frames were placed in this scenic setting, would the composition maintain balance and coherence without appearing out of place?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
