      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the skater into a futuristic cyberpunk athlete with sleek metallic armor and neon accents replacing the hoodie and jeans, evaluate whether the replacement of clothing elements maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows a red hoodie and black jeans on the skater, so this edit involves modifying the torso, arms, legs, and footwear. Attention must be paid to whether the new armor follows natural human anatomy, avoids geometric distortions, and integrates seamlessly with the body posture during mid-air motion.",
      "question": "Does the metallic armor on the skater's torso and limbs maintain anatomical proportions and avoid unnatural bends or stretched shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the skateboard with a hoverboard featuring a glowing, transparent deck, assess whether the transformation preserves physical plausibility and material consistency. The original skateboard has a solid wooden deck with visible wheels and grip tape; the edited version should show a transparent, illuminated surface without breaking geometric continuity or introducing floating fragments.",
      "question": "Is the hoverboardâ€™s transparent deck visually consistent in shape and structure, with no broken edges or misplaced glow effects that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the skate park into a neon-lit urban landscape with digital graffiti animations, evaluate whether the background elements retain spatial logic and visual credibility. The original image includes concrete ramps, metal railings, power lines, and graffiti walls. These must now appear as part of a futuristic cityscape with dynamic lighting and animated textures without distorting perspective or scale.",
      "question": "Are the graffiti elements on the ramps and walls rendered as animated digital displays rather than static paint, with smooth transitions and no pixelation or jagged outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding neon accents and maintaining a vibrant, otherworldly illustration style, examine whether the lighting and color scheme enhance realism without introducing unnatural glows or chromatic aberrations. The skater's armor and hoverboard should emit light in a way that interacts naturally with surrounding surfaces and shadows.",
      "question": "Do the neon highlights on the armor and hoverboard cast soft, consistent glows on nearby surfaces without creating harsh, unrealistic reflections or color bleed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving dynamic motion lines to emphasize movement, evaluate whether these added elements follow the direction of motion and do not interfere with existing structures. The original image shows a skater mid-jump with arms extended; motion lines should originate from the body and board, aligning with velocity vectors.",
      "question": "Are the motion lines positioned along the trajectory of the skater and hoverboard, following natural flow without intersecting or overlapping key features like limbs or the board in an implausible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
