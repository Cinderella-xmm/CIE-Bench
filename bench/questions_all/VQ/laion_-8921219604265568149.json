      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the cathedral into a miniature encased in a baroque-style display case, evaluate whether the material change from stone to warm beige resin affects the perceived realism and natural appearance. The original façade is made of textured light-colored stone with visible weathering and architectural details. The editing involves replacing this material with resin, which may alter texture, reflectivity, and depth perception. This change must preserve fine surface details such as carvings, columns, and arches without introducing artificial smoothness or uniformity that contradicts the original’s aged look.",
      "question": "Does the cathedral façade maintain detailed textures and depth consistent with the original stone structure, or does it appear uniformly smooth and plastic-like due to the resin material?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding tiny, elaborately dressed figures strolling the square, assess whether these figures are proportionally correct relative to the cathedral and surrounding environment. The original image shows people at normal human scale; inserting miniature figures requires accurate scaling and positioning to avoid visual distortion. Their clothing and poses must not appear warped or unnaturally small compared to architectural elements like doors, columns, and windows.",
      "question": "Are the added miniature figures proportionally scaled and positioned so they appear naturally smaller than the cathedral and surrounding buildings without appearing stretched, flattened, or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of including miniature lamps with dim, antique-style glow, evaluate whether the lighting effect introduced by these lamps is physically plausible and visually coherent. The original scene has bright daylight with clear shadows. Adding dim, warm glows from lamps within a miniature setting should not contradict ambient lighting unless intentionally stylized. However, any unnatural halos, inconsistent brightness, or floating light sources would break realism.",
      "question": "Do the miniature lamps emit soft, localized light that appears consistent with their size and placement, without creating unrealistic glows or illuminating areas that should remain in shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enclosing the scene in an ornate baroque-style display case, evaluate whether the addition of the case introduces structural distortions or breaks geometric continuity. The case must frame the entire scene without overlapping or cutting through key architectural features such as the bell towers or central entrance. It should also have consistent perspective and thickness, avoiding warped edges or transparent sections that suggest poor rendering.",
      "question": "Is the display case fully integrated around the cathedral and square with clean, continuous edges and no intersecting or fragmented parts that disrupt the geometry of the original structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding an engraved plaque with the cathedral's name and history, evaluate whether the text and engraving style are legible, appropriately sized, and stylistically consistent with the baroque theme. The plaque must be placed in a logical location (e.g., front base of the case) without obstructing key views or appearing disproportionately large or small. Its material and texture should match the ornate design of the case.",
      "question": "Is the engraved plaque clearly visible, properly aligned, and styled with appropriate depth and lettering that matches the baroque aesthetic without appearing flat or digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
