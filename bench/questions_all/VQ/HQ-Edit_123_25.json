      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying a stylized paper-cut effect to the embroidered garment, particularly the intricate floral and scroll motifs on the back of the dress, this question evaluates whether the transformation preserves the fine details and natural texture of the embroidery. The goal is to ensure that the paper-cut style does not cause pixelation, jagged edges, or loss of depth in the patterns.",
      "question": "Are the floral and scroll motifs on the back of the dress clearly defined with smooth edges and no visible pixelation or broken lines after the paper-cut effect is applied?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying a blue gradient to emphasize the dress in one postcard, this question checks whether the gradient blends naturally with the fabric's original color and texture, avoiding harsh transitions or unnatural color shifts that could break visual coherence.",
      "question": "Does the blue gradient overlay on the dress transition smoothly without creating abrupt color boundaries or altering the underlying texture of the fabric?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enhancing the silver hair accessory with silver tones, this question examines whether the metallic finish appears consistent with the original design and does not introduce unrealistic reflections, shadows, or color inconsistencies that would suggest digital artifacting.",
      "question": "Is the silver tone of the hair accessory uniform and reflective in a way that matches the lighting direction and does not show unnatural highlights or dark patches?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating bamboo patterns into the third postcard, this question assesses whether the added bamboo motifs integrate seamlessly with the background, maintaining proper alignment, scale, and depth relative to the existing bamboo forest behind the subject.",
      "question": "Do the bamboo patterns in the third postcard align correctly with the background bamboo stalks and maintain consistent spacing and perspective without overlapping or floating anomalies?",

      "question": "Does the silk-bound book have a consistent material texture, proper thickness, and clean edges that match the appearance of a real physical object without stretching or warping?",

      "question": "Are the three postcards positioned within the book layout with equal margins and no partial cropping or overlap that would disrupt the visual presentation?",
