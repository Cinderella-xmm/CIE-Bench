      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the rubber tire surfaces must be transformed into durable armor with tread patterns mimicking natural armadillo plates, this question evaluates whether the texture of the tires has been modified to resemble segmented armor without losing fine tread details or introducing unnatural smoothing, blurring, or repeating patterns.",
      "question": "Are the tread patterns on the tire surfaces preserved and reinterpreted as armored segments with no visible texture repetition or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that metallic joints must be introduced within the wheel openings (original hub areas) to simulate articulation points, this question checks whether the added joints appear integrated with the rim geometry, maintaining correct proportions and avoiding distortion or misalignment with the existing circular hub structure.",
      "question": "Do the metallic joints within the wheel openings align properly with the original rim shape and appear physically connected without gaps or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that central wheel hubs must be replaced with glowing mechanical eyes, this question assesses whether the replacement maintains structural integrity, with light emission confined to the eye area and no unwanted glow bleed or artifacting around the edges.",
      "question": "Are the glowing mechanical eyes centered within the hub openings, emitting light consistently without haloing, pixelation, or unnatural brightness spillage onto adjacent surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that antennae-like protrusions with electric blue accents must be added, this question evaluates whether the antennae extend logically from the structure, maintain consistent thickness and curvature, and have smooth transitions between materials (metallic base and blue accent) without floating or clipping issues.",
      "question": "Are the antennae attached to the upper portion of the tire stack with continuous, smooth geometry and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the overall composition must maintain structural coherence and visual credibility, this question checks whether the transformed tire stack retains a stable, grounded appearance with no broken or misaligned components, ensuring the creature form appears plausible and not fragmented.",
      "question": "Is the entire structure composed of the tires forming a unified, balanced creature shape with no missing, duplicated, or incorrectly scaled parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
