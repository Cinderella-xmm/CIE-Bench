      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a spherical glass dome over the sandcastle, this question evaluates whether the dome appears physically coherent and free of artifacts such as jagged edges, incorrect refraction, or unnatural reflections. The dome must fully enclose the sandcastle without distorting its shape or creating visible seams.",
      "question": "Is the spherical glass dome transparent and smooth, with no visible seams, distortions, or incorrect light refractions affecting the sandcastle inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing a sculpted mahogany base under the dome, this question checks if the base has realistic wood grain, appropriate thickness, and correct proportion relative to the sandcastle. It also ensures the base does not appear artificially flattened or warped.",
      "question": "Does the mahogany base have a natural wood texture and consistent thickness, and is it properly scaled to support the dome and sandcastle without appearing distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying glittering grains to emulate sandy texture, this question assesses whether the added glitter enhances realism or creates unnatural sparkle clusters, blurring, or loss of original detail on the sandcastle’s surface.",
      "question": "Are the glittering grains evenly distributed and subtle enough to mimic sand texture without obscuring fine architectural details of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating tiny ornately detailed seashells around the castle, this question evaluates whether the shells are realistically sized, shaped, and textured, and whether they are positioned naturally within the dome without appearing clipped, duplicated, or unnaturally sharp.",
      "question": "Are the seashells around the sandcastle clearly defined, appropriately small in scale, and free from pixelation or unnatural edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a ceramic plaque with text, this question checks whether the plaque is legible, has a consistent matte pearl finish, and is anchored properly to the base without floating or casting inconsistent shadows.",
      "question": "Is the ceramic plaque with “Empire of the Shores” inscribed clearly readable, properly attached to the base, and displaying a uniform matte pearl surface without glare or texture mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying a soft matte pearl finish to all internal surfaces, this question evaluates whether the overall surface treatment maintains a consistent, non-glossy appearance across the sandcastle and shells, avoiding shiny spots or uneven lighting.",
      "question": "Is the matte pearl finish uniformly applied across the sandcastle and surrounding shells, with no areas showing excessive shine or reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence of the sandcastle, this question checks whether any part of the original structure—such as towers, staircases, or arches—is deformed, broken, or misaligned due to the addition of the dome or base.",
      "question": "Are all architectural elements of the sandcastle (towers, stairs, arches) intact and geometrically consistent, with no stretching, bending, or missing sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
