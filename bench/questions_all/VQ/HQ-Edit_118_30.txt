Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the steam train into large colorful blocks, evaluate whether the locomotive and passenger cars have been converted into geometric block forms while maintaining structural coherence. The original train is a detailed steam engine with defined mechanical parts (e.g., wheels, boiler, chimney), so converting it into puzzle-like blocks must preserve its overall shape and proportions without introducing distorted or broken geometries. This transformation affects the realism and visual credibility of the central object.
Question: Are the train’s locomotive and carriages transformed into interlocking geometric blocks that maintain their original proportions and alignment along the track without visible distortions or misaligned edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting smoke into swirling white forms, assess whether the plume of steam has been replaced with stylized, puzzle-like swirls that still appear consistent with the motion and direction of the original smoke. The original smoke is voluminous and billowing upward, so the edited version should retain this dynamic flow in a stylized manner without unnatural textures or sharp breaks.
Question: Is the smoke above the train rendered as smooth, continuous swirling white forms that follow the natural trajectory of rising steam without jagged edges or texture artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing people with smaller puzzle pieces depicting vintage attire, evaluate whether the human figures at the station platform have been replaced by flat, interlocking puzzle elements shaped like individuals in period clothing. These puzzle pieces must maintain recognizable silhouettes and postures without anatomical distortions or missing limbs. The original image shows six distinct people in various poses (sitting, standing, reading), so each should be represented as a coherent puzzle piece.
Question: Are all human figures at the station platform replaced by small, flat puzzle-shaped elements wearing vintage clothing, with no visible distortions in limbs or posture, and do they retain recognizable positions relative to benches and luggage?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the landscape into geometric designs, assess whether the fields, hedgerows, and hills have been transformed into abstract, interlocking geometric patterns while preserving the general layout and color palette of the countryside. The original image features patchwork fields and rolling hills; the edited version should show these as stylized shapes without breaking continuity or introducing unnatural transitions between colors or shapes.
Question: Are the fields and hills in the background rendered as clearly defined geometric patterns (e.g., rectangles, triangles) that form a cohesive, interlocking design without gaps, overlapping errors, or abrupt texture changes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of positioning the entire scene on a light wooden tabletop, evaluate whether the entire composition—train, landscape, station, and figures—is now placed on a flat, light-colored wooden surface with visible grain and edge boundaries. The original image lacks such a surface, so adding it requires consistent perspective and shadowing to avoid floating elements. The transition from ground to tabletop must be seamless and visually plausible.
Question: Is the entire scene, including the train, tracks, station, and landscape, placed on a light wooden tabletop with visible wood grain and consistent lighting, and are there no floating elements or mismatched shadows?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
