Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the natural rock arch into a fantastical stone guardian creature. This involves significant conceptual and structural modification of the central arch structure, which is currently a naturally formed cave opening with smooth, curved rock surfaces. The transformation includes adding crystalline growths along the arch’s curve, glowing veins, skeletal wing-like extensions replacing the arch outline, runic symbols on the inner surface, and a radiant orb as its energy core. These additions must integrate seamlessly with the existing rock textures and lighting conditions to maintain visual coherence. The original image features earthy tones, rough textures, and natural light entering through the archway. Any added elements must respect these physical properties—such as material consistency, shadow direction, and scale—to avoid breaking realism. The sub requirements are derived from ensuring that each added or modified element does not introduce artifacts, distort geometry, or violate natural laws of form and light.

-Sub requirement 1: Transforming the rock arch into a stone guardian creature by modifying its shape and adding new structures (crystalline growths, wings, runes, orb) must preserve structural coherence and avoid geometric distortion, especially in the arch’s curvature and surrounding rock formations.

-Sub requirement 2: Crystalline growths added along the arch’s curve must match the texture and lighting of the surrounding rock, avoiding unnatural glossiness or color mismatches that would break realism.

-Sub requirement 3: Glowing veins across the surface must follow natural patterns resembling mineral veins or biological networks, maintaining consistent brightness gradients and avoiding harsh edges or pixelation that suggest digital artifacts.

-Sub requirement 4: Replacing the arch’s outline with skeletal, wing-like extensions must preserve proportional relationships and physical plausibility—extensions should not intersect improperly with the rock or appear floating without support.

-Sub requirement 5: Runic symbols on the inner surface must be integrated into the rock without disrupting texture continuity, appearing carved rather than pasted, and matching the depth and shading of natural erosion marks.

-Sub requirement 6: The radiant orb at the core must emit soft, diffused light consistent with ambient illumination, casting realistic shadows and reflections on nearby surfaces without overexposure or halo artifacts.

-Sub requirement 7: All modifications must maintain the original lighting direction and shadows (sunlight entering from the top-right), so added elements do not cast inconsistent shadows or glow incorrectly.

-Sub requirement 8: Fine details such as cracks, dust, and soil on the ground and rock surfaces must remain intact and not be obscured or distorted by edits.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the rock arch into a stone guardian creature while preserving structural coherence, evaluate whether the new skeletal wing-like extensions replace the arch’s outline without causing geometric distortion or floating appearance. The extensions must logically connect to the rock mass and not break the continuity of the surrounding terrain.
Question: Do the skeletal wing-like extensions emerge naturally from the rock arch's edges without gaps, floating sections, or unnatural angles?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that crystalline growths must match the rock’s texture and lighting, assess whether the added crystals have appropriate reflectivity and color integration with the surrounding stone. They should not appear overly shiny or mismatched in hue compared to the natural rock.
Question: Are the crystalline growths along the arch’s curve textured and colored to blend with the surrounding rock, avoiding excessive gloss or unnatural highlights?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that glowing veins must follow natural patterns and avoid digital artifacts, examine whether the veins exhibit smooth gradients and organic branching, without sharp edges, pixelation, or abrupt transitions that suggest artificial addition.
Question: Do the glowing veins across the surface follow natural mineral-like patterns and have soft, continuous light emission without jagged edges or blocky artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that runic symbols must appear carved into the rock, assess whether the symbols are embedded with proper depth, shadow, and texture alignment, avoiding flat or pasted-on appearances that disrupt the rock’s natural surface.
Question: Are the runic symbols on the inner surface of the arch carved into the rock with consistent depth and shadow, matching the texture of natural erosion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that the radiant orb must emit realistic light, check whether the orb casts soft shadows and subtle glows on nearby surfaces, and whether its light direction aligns with the sunlight entering from the top-right of the frame.
Question: Does the radiant orb emit light that matches the ambient lighting direction and creates realistic soft shadows and reflections on adjacent rock surfaces?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that fine details like cracks and soil must remain intact, evaluate whether the ground and lower rock surfaces retain their original texture and detail, without blurring, smudging, or occlusion due to added elements.
Question: Are the ground textures, cracks, and soil near the base of the arch preserved and not obscured or distorted by the added elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
