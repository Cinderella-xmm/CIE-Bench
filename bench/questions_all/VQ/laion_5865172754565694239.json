      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a cartoon face near the handlebars on the frame, evaluate whether the facial features (eyes, mouth, etc.) are properly aligned with the frame’s geometry, have consistent texture and shading matching the red paint, and do not introduce jagged edges or color bleeding.",
      "question": "Are the facial features on the frame near the handlebars seamlessly integrated with the red surface, showing no visible seams, texture mismatch, or color artifacts?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding limbs from the hubs, assess whether the limbs emerge from the center of each wheel without deforming the hub, bending spokes, or violating the circular symmetry of the wheel structure.",
      "question": "Do the cartoon limbs extend from the hub centers without distorting the wheel rims, spokes, or hub components?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding motion lines, check whether the lines originate from appropriate positions (e.g., rear wheel or frame) and extend in a direction consistent with forward motion, avoiding obstruction of the drivetrain or branding.",
      "question": "Are the motion lines positioned along the sides of the bike and angled forward, without crossing over the chain, derailleur, or “DUCATI” logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the frame into a hero suit, evaluate whether the red frame retains its original shape and thickness, and any added patterns or outlines do not create false depth or break the continuity of the frame tubes.",
      "question": "Does the frame retain its original tubular structure and dimensional consistency despite the added hero suit design, with no bulges, collapses, or incorrect curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of overlaying sound effects, verify that the text elements like “Vroom!” and “Zoom!” are clearly readable, placed in motion-aligned locations (e.g., trailing behind the bike), and do not overlap critical components such as the seat post or handlebars.",
      "question": "Are the sound effect texts positioned outside the main structural components of the bike and oriented in a way that suggests movement, without obscuring the “DUCATI” branding or control levers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
