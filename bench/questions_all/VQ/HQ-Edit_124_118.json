      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming waterfalls into dynamic animated projections on glass surfaces, evaluate whether the waterfall area (center of the image, cascading from the cliff) maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original waterfall is a natural flow of water; converting it to a holographic projection requires assessing if the shape, transparency, and motion simulation appear physically rational and free of unnatural textures or distortions such as jagged edges or inconsistent light refraction.",
      "question": "Does the waterfall in the center of the image appear as a coherent, transparent projection with smooth flow lines and consistent light interaction, without visible pixelation or broken geometric shapes?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing trees with iridescent fiber optic filaments, assess the tree trunks and branches in the foreground and midground (especially the large twisted vine structure on the left). These elements must retain structural consistency while incorporating artificial luminous materials. Check whether the transition from natural bark to glowing fibers appears seamless and physically plausible, avoiding unnatural texture shifts or abrupt color gradients.",
      "question": "Are the tree trunks and vines in the foreground displaying iridescent fiber-optic-like strands that follow natural branch contours without breaking geometric continuity or exhibiting patchy, non-uniform glow patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of virtualized vines twisting into kinetic light sculptures, examine the vine structures extending from the left and right sides of the frame, particularly where they curve over the river. These should maintain botanical plausibility while appearing as dynamic light forms. Evaluate whether the loops and twists are structurally sound and avoid impossible angles or floating segments that violate physical logic.",
      "question": "Do the vine formations in the foreground and along the riverbanks form continuous, self-supporting loops without floating disconnected segments or geometrically impossible bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating natureâ€™s vibrancy into futuristic architectural space, assess the background environment including distant hills and sky. The original scene features natural terrain and soft atmospheric lighting. After editing, this area must not introduce artifacts such as mismatched lighting, unnatural shadows, or inconsistencies between projected elements and environmental depth. Focus on whether the integration of holographic elements preserves spatial depth and ambient coherence.",
      "question": "Is the background landscape (distant mountains and sky) visually consistent with the foreground projections, showing no abrupt transitions, mismatched lighting, or unnatural fog effects that suggest poor layer blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining fine details without degradation, evaluate the surface textures of the riverbed, leaves, and moss-covered rocks in the lower half of the image. These areas should retain high-resolution detail even after stylization. Check for loss of texture clarity, blurring, or repetitive patterns that indicate low-quality rendering or compression artifacts.",
      "question": "Are the textures of the river stones, foliage, and moss-covered surfaces in the lower portion of the image sharp and detailed, without blurred edges or repeating pattern artifacts?",
