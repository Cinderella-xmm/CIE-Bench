      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the central figure’s wedding dress into a regal velvet gown with intricate lacework and pearls, evaluate whether the material texture and structure of the new gown maintain visual plausibility. The original image shows a fitted white lace wedding dress with defined seams and floral embroidery; replacing it with a velvet fabric must preserve natural folds, light interaction, and structural coherence without introducing unnatural sheen or distorted patterns.",
      "question": "Does the central figure’s gown display consistent velvet texture with realistic folds and shading, and are the lacework and pearl embellishments seamlessly integrated without visible artifacts?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the bouquet held by the central figure from white roses to dark roses, assess whether the new bouquet maintains natural proportions, color depth, and botanical accuracy. The original bouquet features white flowers with greenery and ribbon; the replacement must retain similar size, shape, and hand-holding posture without distorting the stem alignment or introducing unnatural color gradients.",
      "question": "Are the dark roses in the central figure’s bouquet proportionally correct, with natural petal layering and stem arrangement that matches the hand grip and overall bouquet structure?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the bridesmaids’ dresses into brocade gowns with gold embroidery, evaluate whether the new fabrics exhibit realistic textile patterns and reflect proper lighting behavior. The original dresses have a sheer, patterned gold-and-white design; the transformation to brocade must preserve geometric consistency in the weave and avoid pixelation or mismatched textures at seams and shoulder areas.",
      "question": "Do the bridesmaids’ dresses show coherent brocade patterns with natural gold thread highlights, and are the textures continuous across the fabric without breaks or unnatural repetitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the background with an arched garden featuring classical statues and stone pathways, assess whether the new environment integrates naturally with the figures. The original background includes green foliage and a metal railing; the new setting must maintain consistent perspective, scale, and shadow alignment with the subjects' positions and lighting direction.",
      "question": "Are the architectural elements (arches, statues, pathways) in the background correctly scaled and positioned relative to the figures, with consistent lighting and shadows that match the ambient illumination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of updating the bridesmaids’ bouquets to vintage floral arrangements, evaluate whether the hands holding the bouquets remain anatomically accurate. The original image shows clearly defined hands with five fingers each; any editing must preserve finger count, joint alignment, and skin texture without distortion or merging of digits.",
      "question": "Do the hands of both bridesmaids hold their bouquets with five distinct fingers, natural knuckle curvature, and unbroken skin texture, without visible warping or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
