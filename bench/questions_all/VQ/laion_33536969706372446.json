      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the white sheer canopy with deep burgundy drapery, this question evaluates whether the new fabric exhibits natural folds, soft transitions between light and shadow, and realistic interaction with the ceiling light. It checks for artifacts such as jagged edges, unnatural transparency, or repeating textures that suggest low-resolution synthesis.",
      "question": "Do the deep burgundy drapes hang naturally with smooth folds and consistent shadow gradients, and do they cast realistic shadows on the wall and floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding ornate gold woodwork to the bed frame, this question examines whether the new carvings and gilded surfaces are geometrically intact, proportionally correct, and visually integrated with the original wooden structure. It checks for distorted lines, misplaced details, or inconsistent material properties.",
      "question": "Are the gold woodwork details on the bed frame continuous, symmetrical, and free from warped or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing floral patterns on pillows with oil-painted cherub images, this question evaluates whether the new artwork appears as a physical painting on fabric—specifically, whether it shows texture variation, depth, and edge blending consistent with real paint application, not a flat digital overlay.",
      "question": "Do the cherub images on the pillows show visible brushstroke texture, subtle color gradients, and seamless integration into the pillow surface without sharp borders or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining consistent lighting across all modified elements, this question checks whether the shadows and highlights on the new drapery, woodwork, and pillows align with the direction and intensity of the ceiling light source, ensuring no floating or disconnected illumination effects.",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the new canopy drapes and gold woodwork match the direction of the ceiling light and fall consistently on adjacent walls and floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving spatial logic and structural coherence, this question verifies whether the transformed bed remains proportionally balanced within the room—i.e., its height, width, and depth are consistent with the surrounding furniture and ceiling clearance, avoiding clipping or unrealistic scaling.",
      "question": "Is the redesigned canopy bed fully contained within the room boundaries, with no parts extending beyond the ceiling or overlapping the wall, and does it maintain a realistic scale relative to the nightstand and rug?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
