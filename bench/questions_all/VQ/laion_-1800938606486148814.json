      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the shoe upper with sleek, transparent materials revealing intricate circuitry patterns, evaluate whether the material transition from original textile to transparent synthetic is visually coherent and free of unnatural textures. The editing position is the entire upper portion of the sneaker (including mesh panels, overlays, and strap), which must maintain structural integrity while introducing transparency and internal circuitry. Focus on whether the transparency appears consistent, whether internal patterns are clearly defined without blurring or distortion, and whether the texture of the new material aligns with the perceived physical properties of a futuristic tech surface.",
      "question": "Does the transparent upper material appear smooth and uniform without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent opacity across the shoe's surface?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adjusting the Swoosh logo to emit a cool neon blue glow, assess whether the glow effect is physically plausible and integrated naturally into the shoe’s design. The Swoosh is located on the lateral midfoot, and the glow should not distort surrounding materials or create unnatural light bleed into adjacent areas. Evaluate if the glow has soft gradients and does not produce harsh halos or color contamination.",
      "question": "Is the neon blue glow around the Swoosh evenly distributed with smooth transitions and no abrupt color shifts or light leaks into neighboring surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of attaching a small digital screen on the strap displaying dynamic animations, evaluate the placement and appearance of the screen on the white strap near the midfoot. The screen must be proportionally sized relative to the strap, have realistic pixel density, and display coherent motion without flickering artifacts. Check if the screen integrates seamlessly into the strap's structure without causing geometric distortion or unnatural shadows.",
      "question": "Is the digital screen on the strap properly aligned with the strap’s curvature, showing clear and stable animation content without pixelation or visual noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a collapsible digital shoe box with holographic branding and metallic finish, evaluate the spatial relationship between the shoe and the box. The box should be positioned in a way that suggests it can contain the shoe, with clean geometric lines and reflective surfaces that match modern tech aesthetics. Assess whether the box exhibits logical folding mechanics and whether the holographic elements appear layered and coherent rather than flat or distorted.",
      "question": "Does the digital shoe box exhibit consistent geometry and metallic reflection patterns without warped edges or misaligned holographic layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating modern geometric patterns on the metallic shoe box, evaluate whether these patterns are rendered with precision and scale appropriate to the object. The patterns should not appear stretched, repeated unnaturally, or disconnected from the surface. Check for continuity in pattern alignment and whether they contribute to a sense of depth and realism without introducing visual noise.",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the shoe box evenly spaced and aligned with the surface contours, without repeating anomalies or misregistration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
