      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the ballerina into a classical Greek sculpture, the entire figure must be converted to marble texture with chisel marks. This involves altering the skin, clothing, and footwear to appear as carved stone. The question evaluates whether the material transformation at the body surface maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details.",
      "question": "Does the surface of the ballerina’s body show consistent marble texture with subtle chisel marks across all areas including arms, torso, legs, and face?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The original image shows a pink tutu made of layered tulle. In the edited version, this should be replaced with a draped classical robe that conforms to ancient Greek attire. The question checks if the new fabric has natural folds and draping consistent with cloth physics and historical accuracy, avoiding unnatural creases or floating sections.",
      "question": "Are the folds and flow of the robe draped over the ballerina's body physically plausible and consistent with how heavy fabric would hang on a sculpted form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The editing instruction specifies adding a stylized laurel wreath on the head. Since the original image shows a neat bun hairstyle, the addition of a crown-like element must not distort the head shape or cause overlapping inconsistencies. The question assesses whether the wreath is properly positioned and integrated without breaking geometric continuity or creating unnatural shadows.",
      "question": "Is the laurel wreath positioned correctly on the head without distorting the skull shape or causing misalignment with facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The original pose includes pointed toes in ballet shoes, which are now expected to be transformed into stone feet within a sculptural context. The transition from soft pointe shoes to rigid marble feet must preserve anatomical proportions and balance. The question examines whether the foot structure remains structurally sound and proportionally accurate after conversion.",
      "question": "Do the feet retain proper human anatomy and alignment while appearing as carved stone, with no deformation or disproportionate elongation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The background is to be changed to an ancient Greek temple setting with Ionic columns and a mosaic floor. This requires replacing the plain wall and wooden floor with architecturally correct elements. The question evaluates whether the new environment integrates naturally with the figure, maintaining perspective consistency and spatial logic.",
      "question": "Are the Ionic columns and mosaic floor aligned with the figure’s scale and perspective, showing no mismatch in depth or proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
