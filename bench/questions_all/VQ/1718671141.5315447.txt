Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the circular glass building into a steampunk-inspired structure with brass gears and copper funnels, evaluate whether the material properties (e.g., metallic sheen, texture, color) of the newly added elements match the intended steampunk aesthetic while maintaining visual coherence with the original architectural form. Specifically, check if the integration of brass and copper components appears physically plausible and avoids unnatural textures or inconsistent lighting.
Question: Are the brass gears and copper funnels added to the building's exterior consistent in material appearance, showing realistic metallic reflections and surface details without artificial or pixelated textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the moon with giant clock faces integrated into the observatory dome, assess whether the clock faces are proportionally scaled and geometrically aligned with the dome’s curvature. Check for structural distortions such as warped numbers, misaligned hands, or inconsistencies in depth perception that would compromise visual credibility.
Question: Do the clock faces on the observatory dome maintain correct proportions and alignment with the spherical shape, with no visible warping or bending of clock numerals or hands?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding steam venting from the structure, evaluate whether the steam plumes emerge logically from designated vents and follow natural flow patterns (e.g., rising vertically, dispersing gradually). Assess whether the steam has appropriate translucency and volume, avoiding flat or blocky rendering that suggests digital artifacts.
Question: Does the steam emanating from the structure appear volumetric and translucent, rising naturally from vents without abrupt edges or unnatural clustering?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of integrating ornate metalwork onto the observatory dome, examine whether the decorative elements (such as filigree, rivets, or scrollwork) are evenly distributed and structurally coherent with the dome’s surface. Check for broken lines, missing segments, or mismatched scale that could indicate editing artifacts.
Question: Are the ornamental metal details on the observatory dome continuous and properly scaled, with no gaps, overlapping errors, or jagged edges suggesting incomplete rendering?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency between the edited building and its reflection in the water, assess whether the reflected image accurately mirrors the modified features (e.g., gears, clocks, steam vents) without distortion or misalignment. Evaluate if the reflection preserves symmetry and clarity, especially around complex shapes like curved domes and angular metalwork.
Question: Is the reflection of the building in the water a symmetrical and undistorted mirror image of the edited structure, including all added steampunk elements such as gears, clock faces, and steam vents?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
