Q1: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement is to ensure the overall authenticity and natural appearance when the river bend and bridge are replaced with a battlefield scene. The character’s pose and facial expression must remain unchanged. The battlefield scene should maintain a natural appearance and avoid introducing unnatural textures.
Question: Does the battlefield scene in the background appear naturally integrated without unnatural textures or color clashes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: To maintain structural coherence and visual plausibility, the character's pose and facial expression should remain consistent with the original while the background changes. The transition between the character and the new background needs to be smooth and undistorted.
Question: Are the character's pose and facial expression consistent with the original image and not distorted by the new background?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: The battlefield scene in the midst of an explosion should be visually credible and structurally consistent with the rest of the image. There should be no broken geometric shapes or degraded fine details within this new background.
Question: Does the battlefield scene in the background avoid broken geometric shapes and retain fine details?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The replacement of the bridge and river bend with a battlefield scene while retaining the character's pose and expression requires examining if the new elements introduce any artifacts or unnatural blending issues.
Question: Are there no visible artifacts or blending issues where the new battlefield scene meets the edges of the character?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The new battlefield scene should complement the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the image. The presence of an explosion in the battlefield should be coherent with the existing character's emotional expression.
Question: Does the explosion in the battlefield scene coherently match the character’s expression and contribute to the overall natural appearance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
