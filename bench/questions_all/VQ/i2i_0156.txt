Q1:  
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of extending the slightly curled pages out of the frame and ensuring overall realism and natural appearance, consider if the extension of the page edges appears realistic and consistent with the rest of the book. Additionally, evaluate if the shadows cast by the extended pages look natural.
Question: Do the extended page edges blend naturally into the frame without introducing any unnatural breaks or abrupt transitions at the corners?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q2: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement to maintain structural coherence and visual plausibility while adding a curved shadow, assess whether the shadow aligns logically with the light source in the original image and if it enhances the perception of depth without appearing artificial.
Question: Does the curved shadow cast by the extended pages follow the lighting direction present in the original image, contributing to a natural perception of depth?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q3: 
Thinking process: To ensure the absence of obvious artifacts and preservation of fine details, examine if the texture of the extended pages matches the original pages and if there's any loss of detail in the text or paper grain.
Question: Are the texture and fine details of the extended pages consistent with the original pages, with no visible loss or distortion of the text and paper grain?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q4: 
Thinking process: Considering the goal to create the impression that the book is unfolding towards the viewer, analyze if the perspective and curvature of the extended pages align with this intended effect. Ensure there is no distortion in the geometry of the pages.
Question: Is the curvature of the extended pages consistent with the perspective of the original image, creating a believable unfolding effect without distorting the geometric shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q5: 
Thinking process: In order to maintain visual credibility and authenticity of the scene, verify that the interaction between the book and the wooden table surface remains plausible after the edits. Check if the edges of the book still interact correctly with the table.
Question: Does the interaction between the base of the book and the wooden table appear natural, with no unrealistic gaps or overlaps introduced by the extension of the pages?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
