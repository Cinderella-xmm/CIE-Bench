      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the heart-shaped board of produce into a LEGO mosaic, the avocado half at the top-left must be transformed using smooth LEGO bricks to mimic its texture. This involves assessing whether the transition from a natural, curved surface to a pixelated, blocky structure maintains visual coherence and avoids unnatural edges or distortions in shape.",
      "question": "Does the LEGO representation of the avocado half retain a smooth, curved appearance with consistent brick alignment along its edge, avoiding jagged or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The berries (blueberries and raspberries) are located at the top-center of the heart shape. The editing instruction specifies using round LEGO bricks for berries. This requires evaluating whether the spherical nature of each berry is preserved through rounded brick placement, ensuring no flattened or misshapen forms that would compromise realism or structural plausibility.",
      "question": "Are the blueberries and raspberries represented with uniformly sized round LEGO bricks that maintain their individual spherical form without flattening or merging into irregular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The broccoli at the bottom-right of the heart-shaped board has a complex, fractal-like structure. Converting it into chunky LEGO bricks must preserve its branching geometry while avoiding unnatural simplification or loss of fine detail. This tests whether the LEGO version retains structural fidelity and visual credibility despite material change.",
      "question": "Does the LEGO broccoli maintain a layered, tree-like branching structure with distinct florets, avoiding overly simplified or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The red bell pepper at the bottom-center is a large, smooth, curved object. Its conversion into LEGO bricks should use appropriately sized bricks to simulate curvature without introducing sharp angles or visible gaps. This evaluates whether the material transformation preserves the natural contour and avoids artifacts like uneven surfaces or misaligned seams.",
      "question": "Is the surface of the LEGO red bell pepper smoothly curved with tightly fitted bricks, showing no visible gaps or abrupt angular transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The heart-shaped wooden board itself must remain intact in outline but be replaced entirely with LEGO bricks. The integrity of the heart shape is critical for visual coherence. This checks whether the outer border of the LEGO construction precisely follows the original heart contour without bulges, dents, or misalignment.",
      "question": "Does the outer edge of the LEGO heart-shaped board follow the exact contour of the original wooden board without deviations, breaks, or irregularities in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The asparagus bundle, tied with twine, is positioned vertically near the center-left. Converting this into LEGO bricks requires maintaining the slender, elongated shape and bundled appearance. This assesses whether the LEGO version preserves the parallel alignment of stalks and the presence of a rope-like element, avoiding distortion or separation.",
      "question": "Are the LEGO asparagus stalks aligned in parallel and bound together by a LEGO representation of twine, preserving the original bundle's structure and proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The background changes from a dark wooden plank surface to a neutral gray base. This shift must not affect the heart-shaped LEGO boardâ€™s placement or introduce shadows or reflections inconsistent with a flat, neutral surface. This evaluates whether the new background supports the LEGO aesthetic without visual conflict or artifacting.",
      "question": "Is the LEGO heart-shaped board placed on a uniform gray base with no visible shadows, highlights, or texture inconsistencies that suggest mismatched lighting or depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
