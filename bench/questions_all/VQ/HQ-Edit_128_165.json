      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the central dome into a translucent bell-shaped body, this question evaluates whether the surface of the new bell shape appears uniformly translucent with smooth gradients and no visible stitching or artificial texture artifacts. The material should resemble living tissue or gelatinous matter rather than glass or metal.",
      "question": "Does the bell-shaped body of the jellyfish have a consistent translucent appearance with no sharp edges, visible seams, or unnatural texture patches?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the metal framework into iridescent tendrils, this question assesses whether the tendrils flow naturally from the main body, exhibit smooth curvature, and display iridescence without pixelation or abrupt color shifts. The geometry must avoid mechanical rigidity and mimic organic movement.",
      "question": "Are the tendrils extending from the jellyfish's body smooth, curved, and iridescent, with no angular distortions or segmented appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing geometric patterns with swirling bioluminescent designs, this question checks if the internal glow patterns are fluid, continuous, and organic in shape, avoiding sharp lines or repetitive digital motifs that would suggest artificial rendering.",
      "question": "Do the internal glowing patterns within the jellyfish's bell appear as natural, swirling bioluminescent designs without repeating geometric shapes or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding glowing star-like nodules along the tendrils, this question evaluates whether these nodules emit soft, diffused light with realistic falloff and are evenly spaced in a way that suggests biological growth, not random placement or digital over-rendering.",
      "question": "Are the glowing nodules along the tendrils softly illuminated with gradual light spread and positioned in a natural, non-uniform but plausible arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of recontextualizing the environment as an underwater realm, this question examines whether the lighting has shifted to a diffuse, blue-green hue typical of underwater scenes, and whether there are subtle water particles or depth effects present, while maintaining the original ceiling structure’s relative position and scale.",
      "question": "Is the ambient lighting in the scene diffused and tinted with blue-green hues, and are there faint water particles or depth cues visible around the jellyfish, consistent with an underwater environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining a seamless transition from the original hanging chain to the jellyfish’s attachment point, this question checks whether the connection between the jellyfish and the ceiling is physically plausible—such as a gentle tapering or organic fusion—without floating or disconnected parts.",
      "question": "Is the connection point between the jellyfish and the ceiling smooth and continuous, with no floating segments or abrupt breaks in structure?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
