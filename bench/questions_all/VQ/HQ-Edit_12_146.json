      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the attire into a Baroque-inspired royal ensemble with opulent fabric and gold filigree embroidery, the original image features a richly embroidered blue jacket with floral patterns. The editing involves changing the color scheme to include purples and deep reds while maintaining intricate embroidery. This requires evaluating whether the new colors blend naturally with the existing textures and whether the added gold filigree appears physically plausible and consistent with the fabric’s structure. The focus is on material authenticity and visual coherence.",
      "question": "Are the newly introduced purple and deep red hues in the attire seamlessly integrated with the existing fabric texture without creating unnatural color transitions or clashing patterns?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The original headpiece includes a turban adorned with flowers, peacock feathers, and jewelry. The instruction specifies replacing it with an elaborate feathered crown adorned with jewels. This transformation affects shape, material, and spatial arrangement. The evaluation must determine if the new crown maintains geometric integrity, realistic proportions, and natural placement of feathers and gems relative to the head and face.",
      "question": "Does the redesigned feathered crown maintain symmetrical and anatomically plausible positioning on the head, with feathers and jewels arranged in a way that does not distort facial features or create floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The original image shows hands with henna-like designs and rings. The instruction calls for reimagining hand accessories with intricate gold rings and bracelets. This involves adding or modifying metallic jewelry. The evaluation focuses on whether these additions appear physically attached to the skin, conform to hand anatomy, and do not introduce unnatural shadows, reflections, or overlapping issues.",
      "question": "Are the gold rings and bracelets on the hands positioned naturally, with proper alignment to finger joints and no signs of clipping, misalignment, or artificial edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The original background is a plain brown gradient. The instruction specifies replacing it with a richly textured tapestry backdrop reflecting regal heritage. This change affects depth, lighting, and composition. The evaluation checks whether the new backdrop integrates smoothly with the subject, respects light direction from the original scene, and avoids abrupt edges or inconsistent textures.",
      "question": "Is the tapestry backdrop visually continuous with the subject's clothing and lighting, showing no visible seams, mismatched textures, or unnatural shadowing around the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The original image includes a peacock feather held by the subject. The instruction implies this element may be retained or enhanced as part of the Baroque aesthetic. The evaluation checks whether the feather remains structurally coherent—its curvature, barbs, and iridescence are preserved or realistically enhanced—and whether it interacts naturally with the hand and surrounding environment.",
      "question": "Does the peacock feather held in the hand display natural curvature and feather structure, with no broken barbs, unnatural color patches, or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
