Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "adding 'Breathe' at the top left corner maintaining a natural and realistic appearance", we need to assess if the text addition introduces any unnatural artifacts or disrupts the plant's structural coherence.
Question: Does the addition of 'Breathe' at the top left corner blend naturally with the image without introducing any visible artifacts or disrupting the plant's structural appearance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the sub requirement of "adding 'Calm' at the bottom right corner while keeping a natural appearance", we need to verify if this addition distorts the window frame's geometric coherence and the overall scene's consistency.
Question: Is the inclusion of 'Calm' at the bottom right corner naturally integrated into the scene, ensuring that the window frame's geometry remains intact and visually plausible?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement to "maintain structural consistency and visual credibility across the entire image after adding the text", itâ€™s essential to confirm that neither the light reflections nor shadowing on the leaf surfaces appear unnaturally altered.
Question: Are the light reflections and shadows on the leaves natural and consistent with the lighting source, unaffected by the added text 'Breathe' and 'Calm'?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: To ensure the sub requirement of "absence of obvious artifacts and loss of fine details is met", we must check if the texture details of the terracotta pot and its saucer remain intact and unaltered post-editing.
Question: Do the texture details of the terracotta pot and its saucer remain authentic and detailed, with no degradation or introduction of unnatural textures due to the addition of text?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Following the sub requirement of "ensuring the proportion and physical rationality of elements avoid distortion such as broken geometric shapes", we need to evaluate if the positioning of the text does not distort the plant's form or window's symmetry.
Question: Has the positioning of 'Breathe' and 'Calm' preserved the plant's form and the window's symmetry, avoiding any distortion or disruption in proportions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
