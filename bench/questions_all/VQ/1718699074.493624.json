      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to replace the head structure with luminous digital panels while preserving original geometry, this question evaluates whether the new panel surfaces conform to the existing facial contours and structural lines of the head. It checks for unnatural breaks, misaligned edges, or mismatched normals that would suggest poor integration.",
      "question": "Do the luminous panels follow the exact shape and curvature of the original headâ€™s surface without visible gaps or overlapping seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to add dynamic neon animations, this question examines whether the animated elements (such as glowing lines or shifting colors) are rendered with consistent brightness, smooth transitions, and no jagged edges or aliasing that would indicate low-resolution or poorly integrated effects.",
      "question": "Are the neon animations on the digital panels displayed with sharp, continuous light patterns and no pixelated or fragmented sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to replace natural overgrowth with synthetic glow-in-the-dark foliage, this question evaluates whether the new vegetation has a uniform yet natural distribution, emits light consistently from within, and does not appear as flat textures or unrealistic shapes.",
      "question": "Does the synthetic foliage emit a soft, even glow from within, and do the individual plant forms have defined structure and depth without appearing like flat decals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to refine surrounding buildings with metallic facades and AR features, this question checks whether the new materials reflect light realistically, have consistent surface detail, and do not exhibit warping or stretching that would suggest deformation.",
      "question": "Do the metallic surfaces of the surrounding buildings show accurate reflections and subtle surface variations without distorted grid patterns or stretched textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to preserve architectural angles and spatial relationships, this question ensures that the transformed head and pedestal retain correct perspective alignment with the background structures, avoiding floating or misaligned components.",
      "question": "Is the transformed head and pedestal aligned correctly with the horizon and surrounding buildings, showing no angular distortion or perspective mismatch?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
