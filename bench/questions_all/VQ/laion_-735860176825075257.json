      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering the building in paper-cut style with sharp, angular edges emphasizing Tudor elements, this involves transforming the architectural features such as the timber-framed gables and brickwork into stylized geometric forms. The editing target includes the rooflines, window frames, and structural beams visible in the original image (e.g., the pointed gable above the entrance and the half-timbered sections). The question evaluates whether the transformation maintains structural coherence and avoids distortion of geometric shapes, particularly at junctions like eaves and corners.",
      "question": "Are the edges of the rooflines, gables, and timber framing sharply defined and angular without rounded or blurred transitions that contradict the paper-cut style?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to enhance window frames and plant motifs with gold foil accents for contrast, the editing targets include the white window frames across the facade (especially on the upper floors) and the flower boxes along the wall and balcony. This modification introduces a reflective metallic texture. The question assesses whether the gold foil appears integrated and physically plausible, without unnatural sheen or textural inconsistencies that break realism.",
      "question": "Do the gold foil accents on the window frames and flower box edges appear uniformly applied with consistent reflectivity and no pixelated or smudged textures?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to depict the entrance awning in bold crimson hues, the editing target is the light blue awning above the main entrance, which currently has a neutral tone. The change involves color replacement while preserving the shape and structure. The question checks if the new crimson color maintains visual credibility by not clashing with surrounding materials or creating unnatural shadows or highlights.",
      "question": "Is the crimson color of the entrance awning evenly distributed and consistent with the lighting direction, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural shadowing?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to print on textured cream-colored paper with geometric arch borders, the editing involves adding a background layer simulating paper texture and border design around the entire scene. This affects the overall composition and perceived medium. The question evaluates whether the simulated paper texture is uniform and realistic, and whether the geometric arch borders are aligned properly without intersecting or distorting architectural elements.",
      "question": "Are the geometric arch borders cleanly aligned with the edges of the image and do they not overlap or distort any part of the building's structure?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to frame the postcard in simple borderless framing for a modern look, this implies removing or minimizing physical frame boundaries. However, since the final output is a postcard, the absence of a visible frame must not introduce gaps or misalignment in the composition. The question ensures that the edge of the image does not show artifacts such as cropping errors, jagged lines, or incomplete rendering due to the borderless format.",
      "question": "Does the edge of the image appear clean and continuous without visible clipping, jagged lines, or missing pixels that suggest improper trimming or rendering?",
