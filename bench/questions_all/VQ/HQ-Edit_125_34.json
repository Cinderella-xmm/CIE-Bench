      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the desk into an elaborate control panel with brass gears and levers, evaluate whether the added mechanical components (gears, levers) maintain structural coherence with the original ornate wooden desk. The editing position is the central desk surface and legs, which originally feature intricate carvings. The addition of steampunk elements must preserve geometric integrity and avoid unnatural textures or misaligned joints. The question assesses whether the integration of brass elements appears physically plausible and free from distortions such as floating parts or inconsistent material transitions.",
      "question": "Are the brass gears and levers on the desk properly aligned with the deskâ€™s structure, showing no signs of floating, misshapen geometry, or unnatural material seams?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying books into mysterious glowing tomes with mechanical bookmarks, evaluate the visual plausibility of the book modifications. The original image shows stacked books on the right side of the desk and under it. These books must be altered to emit a soft glow while retaining their physical form and texture. The mechanical bookmarks should appear integrated without breaking the natural shape of the pages or introducing artifacts like pixelation or inconsistent lighting.",
      "question": "Do the modified books display consistent glowing effects without distorting their page edges or causing unnatural light bleeding into surrounding surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adjusting the globe on the screen to appear as a holographic 3D model, evaluate whether the monitor's display has been transformed into a convincing holographic projection. The original image shows a flat world map on the computer screen. The hologram must appear suspended above the screen with depth, transparency, and light refraction effects that are visually coherent and not artificially rendered. The question checks for realistic volumetric rendering and absence of jagged edges or misplaced shadows.",
      "question": "Is the holographic globe above the monitor clearly visible with proper depth and transparency, and does it cast natural shadows or reflections on the desk surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating elaborate, ornate frames around the windows to enhance the steampunk vibe, evaluate the visual consistency of the new window frames. The original image features simple wooden window frames with dark curtains. The addition of intricate steampunk-style patterns must align with the existing architectural style and avoid overlapping or conflicting with the curtain placement or glass panes. The question focuses on whether the new frames maintain geometric accuracy and material realism.",
      "question": "Are the newly added ornate frames around the windows seamlessly integrated with the existing window structure, without overlapping glass panes or creating distorted perspective lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining overall authenticity and natural appearance in all modifications, evaluate whether the combined elements (brass components, glowing books, hologram, ornate frames) coexist without introducing visual inconsistencies such as mismatched lighting, texture conflicts, or compositional imbalance. The entire scene must retain a unified aesthetic where each edited element supports the steampunk theme without appearing pasted or isolated.",
      "question": "Do all edited elements (gears, glowing books, hologram, window frames) share consistent lighting and shadow behavior, avoiding abrupt changes in brightness or material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
