Q1:
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "adding 'Warm' at the top left without affecting the overall realism and natural appearance", consider the addition of text and its effect on the image's authenticity and coherence.
Question: Does the text 'Warm' at the top left blend seamlessly into the image without disrupting the natural appearance or introducing any unnatural artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of "adding 'Start' at the bottom right while maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility", evaluate if the new text fits naturally with the existing scene and does not cause visual distortion.
Question: Is the text 'Start' at the bottom right positioned in a way that it aligns well with the surrounding elements and does not introduce any visible distortion or artifact?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Focusing on ensuring that the added texts do not degrade the fine details or introduce unnatural textures, assess the texture and clarity around the newly added texts.
Question: Are the textures around the added texts 'Warm' and 'Start' consistent with the rest of the image, maintaining clarity and avoiding any visible degradation of detail?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Evaluate if the addition of new text elements affects the structural consistency of the image, specifically looking at whether the geometric shapes and proportions remain logical and undistorted.
Question: Do the geometric shapes and proportions of objects within the image remain intact and logically consistent after the addition of the texts 'Warm' and 'Start'?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Confirm that the overall composition and layout of the image maintain a sense of visual credibility and naturalness after incorporating the new text elements, ensuring the branding message is effectively conveyed.
Question: Does the overall composition and layout, including the placement of 'Warm' and 'Start', contribute to a visually credible and coherent brand ad message without any apparent inconsistencies?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
