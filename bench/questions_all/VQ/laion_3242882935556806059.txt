Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the orange lilies into intricate crystal sculptures with transparent and tinted amber hues while maintaining petal shapes through layered jagged crystal facets, this involves a material and texture transformation. The editing position is the flower cluster (specifically the petals), which must retain their original floral form but now appear as crystalline structures. This requires evaluating whether the new material (crystal) is applied consistently without introducing unnatural textures or distortions in shape.
Question: Are the petal shapes preserved with jagged crystal facets that follow the natural curvature of the original lily petals, without visible warping or geometric breaks?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the stems and leaves with delicate glass rods emanating from the vase, the editing position includes the green stems and any visible foliage below the bloom. The transformation from organic plant stems to artificial glass rods affects structural coherence and visual plausibility. It must be checked whether the glass rods maintain proportional length and thickness relative to the bouquet and whether they appear integrated with the vase.
Question: Do the glass rods extend naturally from the vase upward, matching the number and spacing of the original stems, without appearing disconnected or misaligned?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of positioning the transformed bouquet on a sleek black marble tabletop, the editing position extends to the base area beneath the vase. This introduces a new surface element that must align spatially and visually with the vase and bouquet. The presence of a reflective, polished black marble surface should enhance elegance but must not introduce inconsistent lighting, reflections, or shadowing that contradict the scene's physical logic.
Question: Is the black marble surface beneath the vase smooth, uniformly dark, and reflective, with shadows and highlights consistent with the light source and object placement?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using transparent and tinted amber hues for the crystal lilies, the editing position is the entire flower cluster. The coloration must reflect realistic light interaction within translucent materials—amber tones should vary subtly with depth and angle, mimicking real crystal refraction. Any flat or uniform coloring would reduce perceived authenticity.
Question: Do the crystal petals exhibit subtle variations in amber hue and transparency, with internal light refractions and depth cues that suggest volume and translucency?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency between the transformed elements and the vase, the editing position includes the interface between the glass rods and the water inside the vase. Since the rods are artificial and non-organic, their entry into the water must respect optical physics—such as bending due to refraction—and avoid abrupt transitions or floating effects.
Question: Do the glass rods enter the water at angles consistent with refraction, showing slight bending at the waterline, and remain submerged without floating or disappearing mid-length?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
