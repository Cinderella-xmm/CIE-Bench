Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of modifying the fox’s facial features to include exaggerated expressions and a leaf crown, evaluate whether the added elements (leaf crown) maintain natural texture and structural coherence with the fox's head. The original image shows a realistic fur texture and anatomical proportions; thus, any addition must not introduce unnatural textures or distortions in shape or material.
Question: Does the leaf crown on the fox’s head have natural leaf shapes, consistent texture, and proper alignment with the head without visible seams or unnatural edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of changing the fox’s pose to standing on hind legs with one paw extended, assess whether the new posture maintains anatomical plausibility and physical balance. The original image shows the fox in a seated position with natural limb proportions; therefore, altering the pose must preserve leg structure, joint angles, and overall body geometry.
Question: Are the fox’s hind legs properly aligned and proportioned when standing upright, with no distorted joints, unnatural curvature, or missing limbs?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the background into playful minimalist tree outlines and adding other animals listening, evaluate whether the trees retain coherent geometric forms and whether the new animal figures are proportionally consistent and structurally plausible within the scene. The original image has detailed, realistic tree trunks and foliage; thus, simplification must avoid broken lines or inconsistent scaling.
Question: Do the tree outlines in the background maintain clean, continuous lines without jagged edges, overlapping inconsistencies, or missing segments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting greens to vibrant pastels, assess whether the color shift affects the natural appearance of vegetation and moss without introducing unnatural color patches or loss of detail. The original image features rich green tones with subtle gradients; thus, the palette change should preserve texture clarity and spatial depth.
Question: Are the pastel colors applied uniformly across the forest floor and foliage without creating unnatural color bleeding, pixelation, or loss of fine details like moss texture?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a speech bubble with bubbly font text, evaluate whether the speech bubble integrates naturally into the scene without visual artifacts such as floating edges, incorrect shadows, or mismatched scale. The original image has soft lighting and depth cues; thus, the added element must align with lighting direction and perspective.
Question: Is the speech bubble positioned at a plausible distance from the fox, with correct shadowing and edge blending that matches the lighting and depth of the scene?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
