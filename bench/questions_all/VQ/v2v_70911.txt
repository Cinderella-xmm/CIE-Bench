Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility while cracking open the Axe container, we need to assess if the crack appears natural and does not introduce any unnatural artifacts or distortions.
Question: Does the crack on the Axe container appear natural and maintain the structural integrity of the container without any visible artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement of ensuring the overall authenticity and natural appearance involves checking if the vibrant miniature nebula inside the container blends well with the container's interior and does not look out of place.
Question: Does the miniature nebula inside the container blend naturally with the interior of the container and maintain visual plausibility?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: To ensure the absence of obvious artifacts and the retention of fine details, we need to verify if the cosmic dust and gases within the nebula retain their texture and detail without appearing pixelated or unnatural.
Question: Are the cosmic dust and gases within the nebula detailed and textured, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or pixelation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility requires us to confirm that the proportions and physical rationality of the nebula match the size and shape of the container's opening.
Question: Does the size and shape of the nebula fit naturally within the container's opening, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: To ensure the overall realism and natural appearance, we need to check if the fiery red and energetic pink hues borrowed from the label design are consistent with the nebula's colors and do not appear jarring.
Question: Are the fiery red and energetic pink hues in the nebula consistent with the label design and contribute to the overall natural appearance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
