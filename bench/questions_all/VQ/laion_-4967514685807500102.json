      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"anthropomorphizing the shrimp into a character with limbs and facial features\", this involves modifying the shrimp’s body to include human-like appendages and expressions. The original shrimp have a specific curved shape and segmented texture. The question evaluates whether the added limbs (e.g., arms, hands) are proportionally scaled and anatomically consistent with the shrimp body, avoiding unnatural elongation or joint distortion.",
      "question": "Does the shrimp character’s arm and hand have five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and are they attached at a logical joint point without deforming the shrimp’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding a chef’s hat to the shrimp character\", the hat must be rendered with proper lighting, shadows, and material texture (e.g., fabric folds) that match the surrounding environment. The original image has metallic sheen and soft shadows, so the hat should not appear flat or overly bright.",
      "question": "Does the chef’s hat cast a subtle shadow on the shrimp and have visible fabric texture and creases consistent with real-world materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"depicting the shrimp squeezing a lemon slice\", this involves adding a hand interacting with the lemon wedge. The hand must have a realistic grip, with fingers wrapping around the lemon naturally. The lemon itself must retain its original shape and texture from the original image.",
      "question": "Is the hand gripping the lemon slice positioned with fingers properly curved and spaced, and does the lemon retain its natural wedge shape and surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding motion lines and hovering herb sprinkles\", these elements must follow physical logic—motion lines should radiate from the shrimp’s movement direction, and herbs should appear airborne but not floating in mid-air without source or trajectory.",
      "question": "Are the motion lines aligned with the shrimp’s direction of movement and do the herb particles appear to be dispersing from a logical origin point near the shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"showing the shrimp standing atop a hill of shrimp tails\", this involves constructing a pile of tails that must obey basic physics—no floating tails, no gaps that suggest instability, and tail orientation should resemble natural stacking.",
      "question": "Are the shrimp tails arranged in a stable, gravity-consistent pile with overlapping layers and no floating or suspended pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"using a dynamic, whimsical font for all text\", the font must be readable and stylistically consistent across panels. It should not overlap with characters or objects in a way that obscures content or appears clipped.",
      "question": "Are all text elements clearly legible, positioned without overlapping key visual elements, and rendered with consistent stroke thickness and style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
