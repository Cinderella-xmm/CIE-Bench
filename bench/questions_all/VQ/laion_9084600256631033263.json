      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the car’s body into a sleek silver glass bottle while preserving the original curves, evaluate whether the shape of the edited car maintains the original proportions and silhouette without stretching, compression, or geometric distortion. The transformation must respect the spatial relationships between the hood, fenders, and doors.",
      "question": "Does the glass bottle form retain the original car’s side profile and curvature without visible warping or disproportionate scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the headlights with faceted glass stoppers, assess whether the new stoppers are correctly sized and positioned where the original headlights were, and whether their facets reflect light naturally and integrate with the glass surface. The stoppers should not appear disconnected or overly sharp compared to the smooth glass.",
      "question": "Are the faceted glass stoppers aligned with the original headlight positions and do they show consistent lighting and reflection patterns with the surrounding glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a chrome-finish, gear-shaped lid to the roof area, check whether the lid is centered, symmetrical, and proportionally sized relative to the car’s width. The lid should appear attached and not floating, with no gaps or misalignments at the edges.",
      "question": "Is the gear-shaped lid positioned centrally on the roof and securely connected to the glass body without visible seams or floating edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of embossing the Datsun emblem on the front, evaluate whether the emblem is located where the original grille badge was, and whether it appears raised and clear without distorting the glass surface. The text must be readable and stylistically consistent with both vintage and modern design.",
      "question": "Is the embossed Datsun emblem clearly visible on the front of the glass bottle and does it maintain proper depth and clarity without surface distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing materials to glass and chrome, assess whether the surface of the bottle shows realistic reflections, refractions, and transparency consistent with polished glass. Check for unnatural textures, blurred edges, or areas where the material appears flat or inconsistent.",
      "question": "Does the glass body display natural reflections and highlights across its surface without abrupt transitions or artificial sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
