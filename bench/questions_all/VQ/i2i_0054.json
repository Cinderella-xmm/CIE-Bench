      "thinking_process": "Considering the sub requirement of changing the background to a matte solid gray while ensuring the overall authenticity and avoiding artifacts, we need to verify if the new background integrates seamlessly with the elephant subject and does not introduce any unnatural elements. This evaluation ensures the structural consistency and visual credibility of the image.",
      "question": "Does the newly added matte gray background appear uniform and free of any distortion or unnatural textures?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Given the instruction to remove shadows and achieve a minimalistic design, it is crucial to assess whether the absence of shadows affects the natural appearance of the elephant and maintains its structural coherence within the image.",
      "question": "Does the absence of shadows make the elephant appear unnaturally floating or disconnected from the surface beneath it?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "To maintain the natural appearance and authenticity of the edited image, the fine details and textures of the elephantâ€™s skin must remain intact and not be degraded during the editing process.",
      "question": "Are the fine details and textures on the elephant's skin preserved without noticeable loss after the background change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The editing instructions emphasize highlighting the banana shape and metal stand curves. Even though these elements are not present in the original image of an elephant, the absence of such elements should not introduce inconsistencies or artifacts in the edited image.",
      "question": "Do the absence of banana shape and metal stand curves, which were not part of the original elephant image, result in any unnatural artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The editing instructions require maintaining a minimalistic design by altering the background while keeping everything else natural and authentic. The structural coherence of the elephant must be evaluated, particularly with respect to its proportions and alignment with the new background.",
      "question": "Does the elephant retain its correct proportions and physical rationality relative to the new matte gray background, avoiding any visual distortions?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
