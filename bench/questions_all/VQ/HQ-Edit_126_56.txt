Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the mountains into geometric forms with bold outlines and solid color blocks, evaluate whether the simplified mountain shapes maintain structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image features natural, jagged mountain peaks with realistic gradients and textures. The editing instruction calls for simplification into geometric forms, which may affect the perceived realism. This question checks if the new mountain shapes retain logical proportions and avoid distorted or broken geometric structures that would compromise visual credibility.
Question: Are the mountain shapes simplified into clear geometric forms without distorted edges or irregular facets that break their structural consistency?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of rendering trees as geometric forms with bold outlines and solid color blocks, assess whether the tree shapes are stylized but still maintain a coherent structure. The original image includes diverse tree types with natural branching patterns and foliage density. The transformation into Art Deco style should preserve recognizable tree forms while applying stylistic simplification. This question evaluates whether the geometric trees appear naturally proportioned and avoid unnatural distortions in trunk or canopy shape.
Question: Do the trees retain recognizable silhouettes with consistent geometric proportions and smooth outlines, avoiding fragmented or misshapen branches?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of rendering the river as a series of radiating parallel lines, evaluate whether this stylization preserves the riverâ€™s reflective surface and flow direction. In the original image, the river is calm and reflective, mirroring surrounding elements. The edited version replaces this with radiating lines, which must still align with the river's path and reflect symmetry. This question checks if the radiating lines follow a logical directional pattern and do not introduce abrupt breaks or inconsistent spacing.
Question: Are the radiating parallel lines in the river aligned with its natural flow direction and spaced uniformly to maintain visual continuity?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of emphasizing symmetry across mirrored reflections, evaluate whether the reflection in the river maintains symmetry with the scene above. The original image has a clear mirror-like reflection of trees and mountains. After editing, the reflection should be a symmetrical counterpart of the upper scene, even under Art Deco stylization. This question checks if the reflected elements match the original in shape, orientation, and alignment, avoiding asymmetry or misplacement.
Question: Is the reflection in the river perfectly symmetrical to the elements above it, with matching shapes and positions of trees and mountains?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using bold outlines and solid color blocks, evaluate whether the transitions between colors and shapes are clean and free of artifacts. The original image has soft gradients and natural blending, especially in sky and foliage. The Art Deco style uses sharp boundaries, so this question checks for unintended smudging, bleeding, or jagged edges at the borders of color blocks, which could indicate poor rendering or artifacting.
Question: Are the color block boundaries crisp and clean, with no visible blurring, feathering, or pixelation at the edges of geometric shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
