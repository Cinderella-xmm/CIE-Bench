      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"replacing the elephant’s ears with vast, celestial sails reflecting starry constellations\", this involves a major structural transformation at the ear position. The original image shows large, natural African elephant ears with visible texture and anatomical folds. The edited version must maintain plausible shape and spatial relationship to the head while introducing new celestial patterns. The question evaluates whether the replacement preserves geometric coherence and avoids unnatural distortions or textural artifacts in the sail-like structure.",
      "question": "Do the celestial sails replacing the elephant's ears maintain a consistent size and attachment point relative to the head, without warping or unnatural stretching of the surrounding skin?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"modifying the trunk to emit a delicate, swirling cosmic mist\", this introduces a dynamic visual element not present in the original image. The trunk’s original form is clearly defined with segmented wrinkles and natural curvature. The addition of mist must not disrupt the trunk’s anatomical integrity or create floating textures that break continuity. This question assesses whether the emitted mist appears physically plausible and does not introduce ghosting, pixelation, or unnatural layering.",
      "question": "Is the cosmic mist emanating from the tip of the trunk smoothly integrated into the scene without jagged edges, overlapping artifacts, or inconsistent opacity?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding radiant planetary rings around its legs\", this involves inserting new elements near the lower limbs. The original image shows the elephant’s legs as solid, textured columns with natural shadowing. The rings must be positioned symmetrically and proportionally without intersecting or distorting the leg anatomy. This question checks for visual plausibility in placement and interaction between the rings and the legs.",
      "question": "Are the planetary rings around the elephant's legs evenly spaced and aligned with the limb axes, without clipping into the leg surface or appearing misaligned due to perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adorn[ing] its feet with luminescent star patterns\", this involves modifying the foot area which originally has rough, textured soles. The addition of glowing patterns must respect the physical surface and not introduce floating or disconnected light sources. The material appearance should remain coherent with the rest of the body’s texture, avoiding unnatural glow bleed or color contamination.",
      "question": "Do the luminescent star patterns on the elephant’s feet appear embedded within the foot surface rather than floating above it, with no haloing or color spill onto adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"transforming the elephant’s skin into galaxy-patterned skin\", this involves a full-body texture replacement. The original skin has fine wrinkles, pores, and natural shading. The new pattern must follow these contours without flattening depth or creating mismatched scale. This question evaluates whether the galaxy pattern conforms to the underlying anatomy and maintains visual consistency across the entire body.",
      "question": "Does the galaxy-patterned skin follow the natural folds and creases of the elephant’s body, maintaining consistent texture resolution and avoiding abrupt transitions or stretched patterns?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
