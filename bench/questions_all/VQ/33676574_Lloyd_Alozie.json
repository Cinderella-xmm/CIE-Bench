Check if the shape of the tower maintains its original silhouette while incorporating biomechanical features, ensuring no geometric distortion or disproportionate scaling occurs.",
      "question": "Does the tallest tower on the left retain its original vertical structure and proportional height after being modified with robotic limb features, without any visible stretching, compression, or broken edges?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating neon circuitry patterns into building facades, assess whether the circuit lines follow logical, continuous paths across the surfaces of the central EMAAR building and adjacent towers. Evaluate if the patterns appear seamless and evenly spaced, avoiding jagged breaks, overlapping errors, or mismatched brightness levels that suggest digital artifacting.",
      "question": "Are the neon circuitry patterns on the EMAAR building and nearby towers smoothly integrated into the facade without visible line breaks, uneven spacing, or unnatural color gradients?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying reflexive scale-like panels, examine the surface textures of the dark glass towers (especially the one near the VOCO sign) to determine if the added scales have consistent size, orientation, and reflectivity. Ensure there is no tiling repetition, misalignment, or unnatural sheen that would indicate artificial texturing.",
      "question": "Do the scale-like panels on the dark glass towers exhibit uniform texture and reflection behavior, with no repeating patterns or distorted shapes suggesting low-quality rendering?",

Verify that the glowing roads maintain consistent width, natural curvature, and connection points with surrounding infrastructure, without floating sections or abrupt changes in luminosity or direction.",
      "question": "Do the glowing expressway spines maintain realistic width and curvature throughout their length, connecting logically to surrounding roads and showing no floating or disconnected segments?",

Ensure they do not protrude unnaturally or break the silhouette.",
      "question": "Are the fin-like structures added to the tops of the buildings properly aligned with the rooflines and scaled appropriately, without appearing detached or structurally unstable?",
