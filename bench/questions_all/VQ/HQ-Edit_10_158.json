      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the hiking boot into a finely carved wooden sculpture while preserving its detailed panels and lacing, evaluate whether the material transformation maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original boot features distinct leather panels, laces, and a layered sole structure; these must be translated into wood without distorting their geometry or introducing unnatural textures. This involves checking if the wood grain patterns are consistent with natural wood and if the transition from leather to wood respects the original form’s integrity.",
      "question": "Are the wood grain patterns across the surface of the boot evenly distributed and consistent with natural wood textures, avoiding artificial or repetitive patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replicating the original leather texture and sole using light and dark wood tones, assess whether the color variation in the wood accurately mimics the depth and contrast of the original leather material. The original boot has tonal gradients between brown leather and black rubber components—these must be preserved through wood shading to maintain visual credibility.",
      "question": "Do the transitions between light and dark wood tones on the boot follow the same contour and depth as the original leather and rubber sections, ensuring no abrupt or unrealistic shifts in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving the detailed panels and lacing system, evaluate whether the lacing and stitching details have been faithfully rendered in wood. The original boot has clearly defined eyelets, lace loops, and reinforced stitching—these must remain geometrically accurate when transformed into wood to avoid distortion or loss of fine detail.",
      "question": "Are the lacing holes and surrounding reinforcement areas shaped precisely like the original metal hardware and fabric loops, without deformation or missing structural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of positioning the boot on a minimalist wooden shelf, assess whether the shelf is proportionally appropriate and structurally plausible relative to the boot. The shelf should not appear warped, misaligned, or physically impossible, and it must support the boot without visual imbalance or floating effect.",
      "question": "Is the wooden shelf flat, stable, and properly aligned beneath the boot, with no visible warping, floating, or unsupported edges that break physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of emphasizing the shoe's robust form through subtle grain patterns and craftsmanship, evaluate whether the overall shape and silhouette of the boot remains unchanged and anatomically correct after transformation. Any elongation, compression, or geometric distortion would compromise structural consistency and visual credibility.",
      "question": "Does the boot retain its original three-dimensional shape, including toe box, heel, and ankle support, without any stretching, flattening, or irregular bulges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
