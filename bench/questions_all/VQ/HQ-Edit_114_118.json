      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a curved glass dome enclosing the entire scene, this question evaluates whether the dome's surface appears smooth, transparent, and free from visible seams, scratches, or unnatural distortions. The dome should refract light subtly and not introduce artifacts like double images, ghosting, or inconsistent transparency across its surface. Observing the dome’s edge and how it interacts with light and background elements allows assessment of its realism.",
      "question": "Does the curved glass dome have a smooth, seamless surface without visible seams, scratches, or unnatural distortions that disrupt the visual continuity of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering the sails in papercraft style, this question assesses whether the texture and folds of the sails resemble paper with realistic shadows and depth, while maintaining their original shape and proportion. The transition from fabric to paper should not flatten the sails or cause geometric inconsistencies such as stretched or collapsed sections.",
      "question": "Do the sails exhibit layered, folded paper-like textures with consistent shadows and depth, without geometric distortions or flattened areas that deviate from their original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the water with shimmering blue resin, this question checks whether the resin layer has a translucent, glossy appearance with internal light refraction and wave-like undulations. It should not appear flat, opaque, or abruptly disconnected from the ship’s hull, and must maintain visual continuity with the surrounding environment.",
      "question": "Does the blue resin layer below the ship show consistent translucency, internal glow, and wave-like patterns without abrupt transitions or unnatural textures at the hull interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of suspending seagulls on fine wires, this question evaluates whether the wires are faint, taut, and positioned naturally to support the birds without disrupting their flight posture. The wires should not be visibly thick, crooked, or attached in ways that suggest mechanical rigging rather than graceful suspension.",
      "question": "Are the seagulls connected by faint, straight wires that do not interfere with their natural flight positions or create visible mechanical supports?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency within the diorama, this question checks whether all elements (ship, sails, water, birds, sky) are properly scaled and aligned within the glass dome. There should be no clipping, overlapping, or misalignment between objects, and the dome should not intersect incorrectly with the ship or sky.",
      "question": "Are all elements (ship, sails, water, birds, sky) correctly positioned and scaled within the glass dome without clipping, overlapping, or misalignment that compromises structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
