Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction involves transforming the ornate armored figure into a miniaturized sculpture, which requires scaling down the entire figure while preserving its structural integrity and material details. This change affects the overall proportion and perceived scale of the figure, and any distortion in geometry or texture detail would compromise authenticity. The original image features highly detailed metallic armor with sharp edges, spikes, and organic-like mechanical elements, so reducing size must not degrade fine surface textures or cause unnatural blurring or aliasing.
-Sub requirement 1: Scale down the armored figure to a miniature form without losing fine geometric details such as spikes, rivets, and surface wear, ensuring that the reduction in size does not introduce artifacts like pixelation, smudging, or loss of texture fidelity.

-<Thinking Process 2>: Adding a steampunk-style glass dome around the figure introduces a new transparent enclosure. The dome must be visually coherent with the existing metallic aesthetic, maintaining consistent lighting and reflections. It should not distort the figure inside or create unnatural refraction effects that break the sense of physical realism.
-Sub requirement 2: Add a transparent glass dome enclosing the miniature figure, ensuring it has realistic transparency, refractive properties, and no visible seams or distortions that affect the clarity or structure of the figure within.

-<Thinking Process 3>: Rotating cogwheels at the base of the sculpture must be physically plausible in terms of shape, size, and placement. They should align with the mechanical theme of the armor and not appear floating or disconnected from the base. Their motion should be implied through design (e.g., gear teeth alignment), not actual animation, so their static representation must suggest dynamic function.
-Sub requirement 3: Place rotating cogwheels at the base of the sculpture, ensuring they are geometrically correct, properly aligned with each other, and integrated into the base structure without floating or misalignment.

-<Thinking Process 4>: Small mechanical wings on the back of the figure must be added in a way that respects the anatomical and mechanical continuity of the armor. They should connect seamlessly to the shoulder plates and follow the same material style—metallic, spiked, and weathered—as the rest of the armor. Any mismatch in material, thickness, or joint design could break visual coherence.
-Sub requirement 4: Attach mechanical wings to the back of the figure, ensuring they are structurally connected to the shoulder armor, maintain consistent material and texture, and do not introduce unnatural joints or proportions.

-<Thinking Process 5>: Intricate copper piping accents on the armor must be layered over the existing metallic surfaces without overlapping incorrectly or disrupting the original armor's contours. The copper must have a distinct but harmonious color and reflectivity compared to the silver-gray armor, and the pipes must follow logical routing paths (e.g., along seams or joints) to maintain plausibility.
-Sub requirement 5: Add copper piping details across the armor surface, ensuring they follow natural flow lines, maintain consistent thickness and curvature, and do not intersect or obscure critical armor features.

-<Thinking Process 6>: Suspended brass filigree orbs surrounding the figure must be positioned in space to simulate planetary orbits. These orbs must appear suspended in mid-air, evenly spaced, and sized appropriately relative to the figure. They should not clip into the figure or dome, and their metallic finish must match the steampunk aesthetic.
-Sub requirement 6: Place multiple brass filigree orbs in orbit-like positions around the figure, ensuring they are spatially separated, do not intersect with the figure or dome, and exhibit consistent material properties and lighting response.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of scaling down the armored figure to a miniature form without losing fine geometric details, this question evaluates whether the reduced size preserves the original texture fidelity, particularly in areas such as the helmet horns, shoulder spikes, and chest plate ridges. The presence of pixelation, blurring, or loss of surface detail would indicate a failure in perceptual quality.
Question: Are all fine details such as spikes, rivets, and surface scratches on the armor clearly visible and undistorted after miniaturization?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a transparent glass dome with realistic refractive properties, this question checks whether the dome appears seamless, free of rendering artifacts like jagged edges or incorrect light bending, and whether it correctly frames the figure without distorting its shape or causing double images.
Question: Does the glass dome enclose the figure without visible seams, distortion, or unnatural refraction effects that alter the appearance of the armor?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing rotating cogwheels at the base with proper alignment and integration, this question assesses whether the cogwheels are geometrically sound, properly meshed, and anchored to the base structure, avoiding floating or misaligned teeth that would break physical logic.
Question: Are the cogwheels at the base fully connected to the foundation, with interlocking teeth and consistent size ratios, and no floating or disconnected parts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of attaching mechanical wings that integrate with the shoulder armor, this question evaluates whether the wings are attached at logical joint points, follow the same material style, and do not introduce disproportionate or malformed segments that disrupt the figure’s symmetry or mechanical credibility.
Question: Are the mechanical wings securely connected to the shoulder armor, matching the metal texture and spike design, and free of unnatural bends or misaligned joints?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding copper piping that follows logical routing and maintains material consistency, this question checks whether the pipes are placed along natural armor seams, have uniform thickness and curvature, and do not overlap or obscure important features like the chest plate or gauntlets.
Question: Do the copper pipes follow continuous paths along armor joints, maintain consistent diameter and smooth bends, and avoid intersecting with key armor components?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of suspending brass filigree orbs in orbit-like positions, this question evaluates whether the orbs are evenly spaced, non-overlapping with the figure or dome, and exhibit consistent metallic sheen and shadowing, indicating proper 3D placement and lighting.
Question: Are the brass orbs positioned at varying distances around the figure, not touching or clipping into the armor or dome, and displaying uniform material finish and lighting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
