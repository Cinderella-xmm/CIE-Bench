      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of anthropomorphizing the front tart with bright eyes and a warm smile atop the yellow surface, evaluate whether the added facial features (eyes and mouth) are seamlessly integrated into the yellow surface without disrupting the texture or color gradient of the original custard layer. The editing position is the top surface of the front tart, specifically where the logo currently resides. This involves modifying the smooth, reflective yellow surface to include cartoon-like facial elements. The key perceptual quality dimensions are natural appearance, absence of artifacts, and structural coherence.",
      "question": "Are the eyes and smile drawn on the yellow surface of the front tart smooth, consistent in color with the surrounding custard, and free from jagged edges or unnatural texture disruptions?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding tiny animated forest creatures on the crust rim of the tart, assess whether these creatures are proportionally sized relative to the tart’s crust, positioned naturally along the edge, and rendered with textures and materials that match a whimsical but plausible illustration style. The editing position is the golden-brown crust rim of both tarts, particularly the front one. The addition of small creatures must not distort the geometric shape of the crust or introduce unnatural shadows or lighting inconsistencies.",
      "question": "Do the forest creatures on the crust rim appear proportionally small, properly aligned with the curve of the crust, and have soft, coherent textures without visible pixelation or clipping artifacts?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of overlaying a gentle, swirling path leading into a dreamy forest setting, evaluate whether the path integrates naturally with the existing surface of the tart and background, maintaining visual continuity in terms of depth, perspective, and lighting. The editing position spans from the base of the front tart outward toward the background, involving blending between the wooden surface and the newly introduced fantasy elements. The key concern is whether the path appears physically plausible and avoids abrupt transitions or unnatural gradients.",
      "question": "Does the swirling path extend smoothly from the base of the front tart into the background, with consistent shading and perspective, and without sharp edges or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of surrounding the tart with green foliage and pastel flowers, assess whether these elements are spatially coherent with the tart's position and scale, and whether their textures and colors blend naturally with the overall scene. The editing position includes the area around the base of the front tart and extending into the background. The added flora should not overlap improperly with the tart or cast inconsistent shadows.",
      "question": "Are the green foliage and pastel flowers positioned around the tart at a realistic distance, with proper shadowing and no overlapping or clipping onto the tart’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the image into a whimsical illustration for a children’s storybook, evaluate whether the overall composition maintains visual credibility by preserving the original structure of the tarts while introducing fantastical elements. The core elements—the two tarts—must remain recognizable and structurally intact despite the added illustrations. The key perceptual quality dimension is structural consistency.",
      "question": "Do the two tarts retain their original shape, size, and layered structure (crust, custard, top glaze), with only non-destructive additions applied, and are there no distortions such as warped edges or missing layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
