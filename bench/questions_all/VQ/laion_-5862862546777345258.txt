Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction requires transforming the entire church and square scene into a miniature porcelain diorama encased within a baroque-styled dome. This involves a complete style transformation of the architectural elements (church, buildings, steps, trees, café tables) and human figures. The original image contains a detailed church with stone textures, people in natural clothing, real-world lighting, and outdoor furniture. The edit will replace these with artificial materials like fine china, pewter, glass, and marble. The core challenge is maintaining structural coherence while introducing non-photorealistic materials and scaling down proportions. The transformation must preserve geometric integrity and avoid distortions caused by material substitution or size change.
-Sub requirement 1: Transform the church structure into fine china with intricate details—evaluate whether the new material appears consistent with porcelain texture, maintains original architectural geometry, and avoids unnatural surface artifacts such as cracks, uneven glazing, or missing decorative elements.
-Sub requirement 2: Replace all human figures with tiny, detailed pewter figures—assess whether their proportions are scaled correctly, limbs are anatomically plausible, and they lack digital artifacts like jagged edges or incorrect finger counts.
-Sub requirement 3: Encase the entire scene within a baroque-styled dome—check if the dome is structurally plausible, seamlessly integrated, and does not introduce floating or disconnected elements.
-Sub requirement 4: Replace trees with delicate glass versions—verify that the glass trees maintain natural branching patterns, transparency, and light interaction without appearing distorted or pixelated.
-Sub requirement 5: Replace café tables and umbrellas with miniature versions crafted from fine materials—ensure that table shapes, umbrella canopies, and chair legs retain correct proportions and do not appear warped or flattened.
-Sub requirement 6: Place the entire diorama atop an antique marble base—confirm that the base has realistic veining, appropriate scale relative to the scene, and no mismatched edges or floating appearance.
-Sub requirement 7: Maintain overall composition and spatial relationships—ensure that the perspective remains coherent, shadows align with light source, and no elements appear misplaced due to scaling or material changes.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the church into fine china with intricate details, evaluate whether the material substitution preserves architectural geometry and surface consistency. The original church has defined stone blocks, arched windows, and domed towers. In the edited version, these should now resemble glazed porcelain with visible fine detailing but without warping or loss of structural lines.
Question: Does the church's façade maintain its original architectural shape and symmetry when rendered in porcelain, with no distorted columns, misaligned arches, or broken edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing people with tiny pewter figures, assess whether the human forms are proportionally accurate and free from deformation. The original people are standing, walking, or seated in natural poses. In the edited image, these should be scaled-down metal figurines with correct limb ratios, five fingers per hand, and no fused or extra limbs.
Question: Are all human figures replaced with pewter models that have anatomically correct hands with no more than five fingers, and do they maintain natural postures without joint bending or limb distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of encasing the scene in a baroque-styled dome, evaluate whether the dome is physically plausible and seamlessly integrated. The dome should cover the entire scene without intersecting objects unnaturally, and its ornate design should match baroque aesthetics without visual breaks or floating sections.
Question: Is the baroque-style dome fully enclosing the scene without gaps, overlapping incorrectly with the church or ground, or showing seams or incomplete surfaces?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing trees with delicate glass versions, assess whether the glass trees maintain natural branching patterns and transparency. The original tree on the left side has a full canopy and trunk. In the edited version, it should appear translucent with visible internal structure but without blocky or pixelated edges.
Question: Do the glass trees retain natural branch structures and show transparent, refractive qualities without jagged outlines or unnatural coloration?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing café tables and umbrellas with miniature versions made of fine materials, evaluate whether the furniture retains correct proportions and structural integrity. The original café setup includes round tables, chairs, and large white umbrellas. These should now appear smaller, with thin legs and fabric-like canopies, but not flattened or skewed.
Question: Are the café tables and umbrellas scaled down appropriately with intact shapes—specifically, do the umbrella canopies remain circular and the table legs remain straight and evenly spaced?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the scene on an antique marble base, evaluate whether the base has realistic texture, proper scale, and seamless integration with the diorama. The base should be larger than the scene and feature natural veining, not appear flat or digitally pasted.
Question: Does the antique marble base display consistent veining patterns and appropriate thickness, and is it positioned directly beneath the scene without floating or clipping errors?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
