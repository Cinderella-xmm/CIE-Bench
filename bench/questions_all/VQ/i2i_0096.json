      "thinking_process": "To evaluate if the blending of the front and side views introduces any unnatural textures or loss of fine details, we need to carefully examine the texture and detail of the sofa's fabric in both views.",
      "question": "Are the fabric textures and details of the sofa consistent and clear in both the front and side views, without any visible loss of detail or unnatural textures?",

      "thinking_process": "The structural coherence between the front and side views should be seamless, ensuring a visually plausible combination. This requires examining the alignment of elements like cushions and legs from both perspectives.",
      "question": "Do the cushions and legs of the sofa align naturally between the front and side views, maintaining visual plausibility and coherence?",

      "thinking_process": "For the blending of the two views to appear authentic, the light and shadow effects must remain consistent across both perspectives, avoiding any anomalies that could disrupt the natural appearance.",
      "question": "Do the light and shadow effects on the sofa and surrounding area remain consistent and natural when transitioning from the front to the side view?",
