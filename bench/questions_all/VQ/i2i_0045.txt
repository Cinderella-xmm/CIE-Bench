Q1:  
Thinking process: Considering the need to crop and clean up while retaining only the girl, the stone platform, and the frisbee, the sub requirement is to maintain the structural consistency and visual credibility of these retained elements. The specific editing position involves ensuring the girl, stone platform, and frisbee appear naturally within the scene after the rest is removed.  
Question: Are the girl, stone platform, and frisbee free of unnatural distortions or artifacts, appearing structurally coherent?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The editing instruction requires replacing the original background with a wide expanse of grass and blue sky. This involves maintaining a realistic and natural appearance of the new background. The specific editing position focuses on the transition between the foreground (girl, platform, frisbee) and the new background.  
Question: Does the grass and blue sky background integrate smoothly with the foreground elements, avoiding obvious seams or unnatural textures?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The composition should emphasize the golden ratio, suitable for photography training data, which requires the visual credibility of the composition and layout of elements. Attention should be given to proportions and placement.  
Question: Do the girl, stone platform, and frisbee adhere to the golden ratio principles in their positioning, creating a balanced and visually credible composition?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The sub requirement is related to preserving the fine details of the retained elements during cropping and cleaning. The specific editing position involves the texture and clarity of the girl, stone platform, and frisbee.  
Question: Are the fine details like the texture of the girl's clothing, the surface of the stone platform, and the frisbee preserved clearly without degradation?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The replacement of the background introduces a new element—grass and sky—which should match the lighting and atmosphere of the original scene for overall authenticity. The specific editing position involves evaluating the lighting consistency across the image.  
Question: Does the lighting on the girl, stone platform, and frisbee match the lighting conditions of the new grass and sky background, avoiding mismatched shadows or highlights?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
