      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the snow-capped mountain peaks into jagged wings, this edit affects the upper portion of the image where the mountains meet the sky. The transformation must preserve the general silhouette and elevation of the peaks while introducing angular, wing-like protrusions. The question evaluates whether the new wing shapes have natural-looking edges and gradients, avoiding sharp digital cuts or unrealistic angles that break the mountainâ€™s geological structure.",
      "question": "Do the jagged wing structures formed from the mountain peaks have smooth transitions between rock and ice, and do they follow the natural slope and ridge lines without abrupt geometric distortions?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of morphing the foreground lake into reflective scales, the central-left water body must now display a pattern resembling overlapping scales. This involves altering surface texture and reflectivity. The evaluation focuses on whether the scale patterns are evenly distributed, realistic in size and spacing, and maintain proper reflection of the sky and surrounding terrain without unnatural tiling or blurring.",
      "question": "Are the scale-like patterns on the lake surface uniformly spaced and reflective, with no visible repetition, pixelation, or mismatched light reflections?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of turning the winding peninsula into a sinewy tail, the narrow landmass extending from the right side of the lake must now appear elongated and muscular in form. The question assesses whether the shape has been stretched organically, with gradual tapering and curvature that mimics biological anatomy, and whether the transition from land to tail maintains consistent topography and soil texture.",
      "question": "Does the peninsula resemble a continuous, tapering tail with natural curvature and surface texture, and are there no sudden breaks or unnatural bulges in its shape?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the distant houses into a metallic spine, the small cluster of buildings in the bottom-left must now appear as a rigid, segmented structure resembling vertebrae. This involves changing their material appearance to metallic and aligning them in a linear fashion. The evaluation checks whether the new spine integrates with the ground level, maintains consistent lighting, and avoids floating or misaligned segments.",
      "question": "Are the house structures reshaped into a linear metallic spine that lies flat on the ground with consistent material shading and no floating or disconnected segments?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding swirling cloud eyes in the sky, the upper-right portion of the image must now contain cloud formations shaped like eyes. The evaluation focuses on whether these cloud eyes have defined features such as pupils and irises, and whether they blend with surrounding clouds without harsh edges or unnatural color contrasts.",
      "question": "Do the cloud eyes have clear, symmetrical pupil and iris structures, and are they seamlessly integrated into the existing cloud layer without visible borders or color discontinuities?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of introducing windswept grass fur across the dry grasslands, the golden-brown terrain in the foreground and midground must show directional movement in the grass. The evaluation checks whether the grass appears to be flowing in one direction due to wind, with consistent density and texture, and whether it merges naturally with unaltered areas without abrupt transitions.",
      "question": "Is the grass fur consistently aligned in a single direction across the field, with natural-looking flow and no clumped or artificially drawn streaks?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring seamless integration of all transformed elements, the entire image must appear unified in lighting, shadow, and texture. The evaluation checks for visible seams, ghosting, or inconsistencies between edited and original regions, particularly at boundaries between wings, scales, tail, spine, and fur.",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, duplicated textures, or lighting mismatches between the transformed elements (wings, scales, tail, spine, fur) and the surrounding environment?",
