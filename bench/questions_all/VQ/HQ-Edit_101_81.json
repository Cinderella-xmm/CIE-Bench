      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the yoga pose into an ancient Indian fresco style, the woman’s body posture must retain structural coherence and physical rationality despite the stylistic change. The original image shows her in a balanced tree pose with arms raised and hands pressed together above the head. This position requires precise alignment of limbs and joints. The editing must preserve anatomical correctness while applying artistic stylization.",
      "question": "Does the woman's pose maintain anatomical proportion and joint alignment, with no distorted limbs or unnatural bending at the knee, hip, or spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting her clothing to vibrant, flowing fabrics with intricate patterns, the fabric texture and drape must appear natural and consistent with traditional Indian attire. The original image features tight-fitting modern athletic wear; replacing it with flowing garments requires attention to material behavior under gravity and movement.",
      "question": "Are the textures and folds of the new traditional attire realistic, showing natural draping and flow without unnatural creases or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating mural-like designs in the backdrop featuring sacred symbols and motifs, the background transformation must maintain spatial consistency with the original room layout. The original image includes windows, floorboards, furniture, and lighting that create depth and perspective. The fresco-style background should not disrupt this spatial logic.",
      "question": "Do the mural elements blend seamlessly with the existing architectural features (such as windows, walls, and flooring) without breaking continuity or creating visual inconsistencies in depth or scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding cultural artifacts like lamps and ornate decorations to evoke a spiritual ambiance, these elements must be placed plausibly within the scene. The original image has minimal decor—candles, a small plant, and hanging lights. Introducing new objects must respect the lighting direction and shadow cast by sunlight from the windows.",
      "question": "Are the added cultural artifacts (such as lamps or decorative items) positioned logically in relation to light sources and shadows, with consistent illumination and no floating or misplaced objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of depicting the woman as an elegant dancer in traditional attire, her hands must remain anatomically accurate. The original image shows her hands clasped above her head in a prayer-like gesture. Any stylization must preserve five fingers per hand, proper finger spacing, and natural hand shape.",
      "question": "Do both hands show exactly five fingers each, with natural finger proportions and positioning, and no extra digits or malformed shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
