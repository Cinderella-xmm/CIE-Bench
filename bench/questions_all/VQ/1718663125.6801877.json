      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the child into a Renaissance-style portrait, the face and facial features must remain structurally consistent with the original image. The editing involves changing the appearance of the face (e.g., makeup) to align with historical portraiture style, but the underlying facial structure—such as eye shape, nose proportions, and jawline—must not be distorted. This ensures visual credibility and structural coherence.",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) proportionally accurate and anatomically consistent with the original child's face, without any unnatural stretching or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires adding a detailed, intricate gown with lace and embroidery. The gown must be seamlessly integrated into the image without visible seams, texture mismatches, or unnatural shading. The material should reflect realistic fabric properties such as drape, folds, and light interaction, especially around the shoulders and torso where the gown would naturally fall.",
      "question": "Does the gown exhibit natural fabric folds and shadows that follow the body’s contours, with no abrupt edges or inconsistent textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The hair in the original image is long and straight. The editing instruction specifies giving it a polished, glossy appearance characteristic of 16th-century portraiture. This involves modifying the hair’s texture and reflectivity. The edited hair must maintain its original volume and flow while gaining a smooth, reflective surface without introducing unnatural shine or clumping.",
      "question": "Is the hair rendered with a smooth, reflective surface that maintains natural volume and strand separation, without excessive gloss or artificial sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The background must be replaced with a regal velvet curtain backdrop. This change involves altering the entire background environment. The new backdrop must have a consistent texture, depth, and lighting that matches the subject’s illumination. It should not introduce mismatched shadows or color gradients that conflict with the foreground.",
      "question": "Does the velvet curtain backdrop have uniform texture and lighting that harmonizes with the subject’s illumination, without visible seams or abrupt transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for rich, deep colors like burgundy and gold to enhance the period feel. These colors must be applied consistently across the gown, accessories, and background. The color palette must avoid oversaturation or unnatural contrasts that could disrupt visual harmony. Additionally, the color blending at junctions (e.g., between gown and skin) must be seamless.",
      "question": "Are the burgundy and gold colors applied uniformly and smoothly across the gown and backdrop, without harsh edges or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
