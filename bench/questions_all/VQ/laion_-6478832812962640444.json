      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the embroidered textures into stylized metal inlays with metallic sheen, evaluate whether the material transition from leather to metal at the embossed floral patterns on the shaft and vamp of the boot maintains a natural appearance without introducing unnatural textures or color mismatches. The original image shows detailed stitching and leather grain; thus, any metallic overlay must preserve structural coherence and avoid artificial shine or texture discontinuities.",
      "question": "Do the areas previously featuring stitched embroidery (on the shaft and vamp) now display consistent metallic inlay textures with no visible seams, texture breaks, or mismatched gloss levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reshaping the heel into a bold, stepped architectural motif, assess whether the new heel design retains geometric integrity and physical plausibility. The original boot has a standard block heel; replacing it with a stepped structure must maintain proper proportions and alignment with the sole and upper boot, avoiding floating edges or distorted angles.",
      "question": "Is the newly designed stepped heel structurally aligned with the sole and boot shaft, with clean geometric edges and no floating or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of streamlining embroidered textures into Art Deco-inspired geometric patterns, evaluate whether the transformation preserves the original boot’s silhouette while introducing angular, symmetrical designs that do not distort the shape of the boot. The transition from organic floral motifs to geometric forms must not cause bulging, shrinking, or irregular contours.",
      "question": "Are the transformed patterns along the shaft and toe area composed of sharp, consistent geometric lines without distorting the boot's outline or causing unnatural swelling or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of emphasizing metallic sheen in the inlaid designs, determine whether the reflective properties of the metal appear realistic and consistent across lighting conditions. The metallic surfaces should reflect light smoothly without over-saturation, halos, or unnatural glares that suggest digital artifacts.",
      "question": "Do the metallic inlays exhibit uniform specular highlights without bright spots, halos, or uneven reflections that suggest digital noise or over-processing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency during style conversion, evaluate whether the overall form of the boot—especially the toe box, ankle, and shaft—retains its original proportions and anatomical plausibility. Any exaggeration or flattening due to stylistic changes should not compromise the boot’s wearable appearance or create visual inconsistencies.",
      "question": "Does the boot maintain a natural foot-shaped profile with properly proportioned toe box, ankle, and shaft height, without unnatural elongation, compression, or asymmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
