      "thinking_process": "Given the sub requirement of maintaining the style and material of the soft vinyl figurine while ensuring it looks realistic and natural, we need to assess if the texture and material of the figurine match the expected properties of soft vinyl. We also consider if the figurine retains its core structure from the original image without distortion.",
      "question": "Does the soft vinyl figurine maintain a consistent texture and material appearance throughout, without introducing unnatural artifacts?",

This involves checking if the proportions and physical relationship between the table and the figurine look natural without distortion.",
      "question": "Are the proportions and placement of the figurine on the white ceramic coffee table appropriate and physically plausible?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Since the editing instruction includes placing green plants around the figurine, we need to ensure that these additions do not disrupt the overall natural appearance or introduce any distortions. This requires examining the integration of the plants with the existing elements for seamless blending.",
      "question": "Do the green plants blend naturally with the rest of the scene without appearing out of place or introducing unnatural textures?",

      "thinking_process": "For the inclusion of tea utensils around the figurine, it's crucial that their presence adds to the scene's authenticity rather than detracts from it. This involves verifying that the utensils complement the context and don’t seem disproportionate or misaligned.",
      "question": "Do the tea utensils appear correctly sized and positioned relative to the figurine and other elements, contributing positively to the scene’s visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "In ensuring high perceived quality, it's important that the entire composition remains harmonious and free from anomalies that could undermine the visual integrity. This involves examining the overall arrangement of elements to confirm that none appear misplaced or unnaturally rendered.",
      "question": "Is the overall composition free of any visible artifacts or distortions that would detract from the realistic and natural appearance of the edited image?",
