Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction requires transforming the entire wooden bookshelf and books into a LEGO tower made of individually crafted block books in earthy tones. This involves replacing the original wood texture with smooth plastic-like LEGO bricks, maintaining the overall shape but altering material appearance. The intricate carvings on the spines and shelves must be mimicked using darker LEGO bricks, which implies a shift from organic wood grain to modular brick patterns. The structure must taper at the top, changing its geometry from flat-topped to gradually narrowing, and the backdrop should be plain and muted to emphasize the clean, modular form. These changes affect multiple perceptual quality dimensions: material realism, structural coherence, geometric accuracy, texture consistency, and visual plausibility.

-Sub requirement 1: Replace the wooden bookshelf and books with LEGO blocks while preserving the original layout and proportions, ensuring that the transition from wood to plastic does not introduce unnatural textures or distortions in shape or scale.

-Sub requirement 2: Use earthy-toned LEGO bricks to simulate the original color palette of the books and shelf, ensuring color consistency and avoiding abrupt or unrealistic color shifts.

-Sub requirement 3: Replicate the intricate carvings on the spines and shelf edges using darker LEGO bricks, ensuring that the details are preserved in form and placement without losing fine detail or appearing pixelated or misaligned.

-Sub requirement 4: Modify the structure to gradually taper at the top, ensuring that the tapering is smooth and geometrically consistent with physical logic, without introducing jagged edges or unnatural breaks in symmetry.

-Sub requirement 5: Replace the textured wall background with a plain, muted backdrop, ensuring no remnants of the original wallpaper remain and that the new background complements the modular aesthetic without distracting elements.

-Sub requirement 6: Ensure all LEGO blocks maintain uniform size and alignment, with no floating or misaligned pieces, to preserve structural coherence and visual credibility.

-Sub requirement 7: Maintain the relative spacing and positioning of books on each shelf, ensuring that the modular construction does not compress or stretch elements disproportionately.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the wooden bookshelf and books with LEGO blocks while preserving layout and proportions, this question evaluates whether the material transformation from wood to plastic maintains natural appearance and avoids unnatural textures. The focus is on the surface texture of the LEGO blocks—specifically whether they appear smooth and consistent with plastic rather than retaining wood grain or showing mixed textures.
Question: Do the LEGO blocks forming the bookshelf and books have a uniform, smooth plastic texture throughout, with no residual wood grain or mixed material appearances?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using earthy-toned LEGO bricks to match the original color palette, this question assesses whether the color transition from the original image’s warm browns and tans to LEGO bricks is seamless and free of unnatural color shifts. It checks if the colors are consistent across all books and shelves without sudden contrasts or non-matching hues.
Question: Are the colors of the LEGO blocks uniformly earthy-toned (e.g., browns, tans, dark reds) and consistent with the original bookshelf’s color scheme, without any unexpected or jarring color deviations?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replicating intricate carvings using darker LEGO bricks, this question evaluates whether the detailed designs on the spines and shelf edges are accurately represented in the LEGO version. It focuses on whether the darker bricks form coherent patterns that match the original ornamental motifs and whether these patterns are sharp and well-aligned.
Question: Are the darker LEGO bricks used for carvings clearly aligned and shaped to replicate the original decorative patterns on the spines and shelf edges without blurring or misalignment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of tapering the tower at the top, this question checks the geometric integrity of the structure. It evaluates whether the tapering is gradual and symmetrical, maintaining structural consistency and avoiding abrupt breaks or uneven narrowing that would violate physical plausibility.
Question: Does the top of the LEGO tower taper smoothly and symmetrically from the base upward, without jagged edges, irregular steps, or disproportionate narrowing?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the background with a plain, muted backdrop, this question assesses whether the original textured wallpaper has been fully removed and replaced with a uniform, neutral background. It ensures there are no visible remnants of the original pattern or lighting inconsistencies that could distract from the LEGO structure.
Question: Is the background behind the LEGO tower completely plain and muted, with no traces of the original textured wallpaper or lighting artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining uniform block size and alignment, this question evaluates whether all LEGO bricks are consistently sized and properly connected, without floating, misaligned, or overlapping pieces that would break structural coherence.
Question: Are all LEGO blocks aligned perfectly in rows and columns, with no gaps, overlaps, or floating pieces that disrupt the modular structure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
