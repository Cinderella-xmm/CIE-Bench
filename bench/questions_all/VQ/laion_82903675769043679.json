      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the English manor-style house into a colorful cubist structure with fragmented brickwork into vibrant geometric planes, evaluate whether the architectural transformation maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original building is located in the upper-left center of the image, featuring traditional Tudor-style architecture with red brick, white timber framing, and multiple chimneys. The editing involves replacing its realistic texture and form with abstract geometric shapes. This requires checking if the new structure retains recognizable proportions and avoids broken or distorted geometry.",
      "question": "Does the transformed house maintain consistent geometric shapes without jagged edges, overlapping planes, or unnatural fragmentation that disrupts structural integrity?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering the crowd as scattered, faceless abstract forms, assess whether the human figures near the golf course and around the tents have been replaced with non-representational shapes while preserving spatial distribution and scale. The crowd is primarily located along the right side of the fairway and near the large white tent on the right edge of the image. The original figures are clearly defined individuals; the edit replaces them with abstract forms. The evaluation focuses on whether these abstract forms retain plausible density and positioning relative to the environment.",
      "question": "Are the abstract representations of the crowd evenly distributed across their original positions without clustering or floating elements that violate spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a checkered pattern to the grass, evaluate whether the green turf across the fairways and surrounding areas now displays a regular grid-like pattern. The original grass is uniformly textured and smooth, especially visible in the foreground and middle ground. Introducing a checkered pattern must not cause pixelation, misalignment, or abrupt transitions between patterned and unpatterned zones.",
      "question": "Is the checkered pattern applied uniformly across the entire grass surface without visible seams, inconsistent spacing, or distortion at edges near sand traps and water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the water reflection into prismatic shards, assess whether the reflective surface of the pond in the lower portion of the image has been altered from a smooth mirror-like reflection of the house and sky to fragmented, angular, colored shards. The original reflection accurately mirrors the building and sky. The edited version should show discontinuous, prism-like fragments that still suggest the source objects but in an abstract way. The evaluation checks for unnatural sharpness, color bleeding, or loss of continuity in the water’s surface.",
      "question": "Do the prismatic shards in the water reflect the house and sky in fragmented but coherent angular segments without ghosting, blurring, or unnatural color separation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of fragmenting the brickwork into vibrant geometric planes, evaluate whether the material properties of the house—specifically the red brick and white timber—are replaced with flat, vividly colored facets. This includes assessing if the transition from realistic masonry to abstract planes introduces artifacts such as mismatched lighting, inconsistent shading, or loss of depth cues. The focus is on the front-facing wall and gable ends of the house.",
      "question": "Are the vibrant geometric planes on the house’s facade consistently lit and shaded to match the ambient light direction, avoiding unnatural highlights or shadow mismatches?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
