      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding spectacles to the bear's face, this edit affects facial anatomy. The spectacles must fit naturally over the bear’s eyes without distorting the eye shape, altering fur around the snout, or creating unnatural reflections or shadows. The material of the lenses should appear transparent and consistent with light interaction in the scene.",
      "question": "Are the spectacles positioned correctly over the bear’s eyes without deforming the surrounding fur or causing unnatural lens reflections?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the bear’s expression to a wise, elder-like demeanor, this involves modifying facial muscles and wrinkles. The edit must not cause unnatural creases, disproportionate features, or asymmetry that breaks anatomical plausibility.",
      "question": "Does the bear’s facial expression show subtle aging features (like wrinkles) without distorting the nose, mouth, or jawline geometry?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a speech bubble near the bear’s mouth, this element must originate from the correct point (mouth area) and avoid overlapping critical details like fur or water splash. It should also have clean edges and proper shadowing to blend into the scene.",
      "question": "Is the speech bubble clearly connected to the bear’s mouth and does it not obscure or distort nearby fur or water details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the salmon in the bear’s mouth with a transformation chart, this edit alters the bear’s jaw contents. The new graphic must fit within the mouth cavity without extending beyond natural boundaries or causing visible gaps or warping in the bear’s teeth or gums.",
      "question": "Does the transformation chart fit naturally within the bear’s mouth without exceeding jaw limits or causing visible deformations in the mouth structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding labeled life cycle stages (egg, fry, smolt, adult) in a chart format, this involves placing graphical elements in space. These must align with perspective cues and avoid floating above the river or forest floor without grounding.",
      "question": "Are the labeled stages in the transformation chart aligned with the river surface and do they cast appropriate shadows or depth cues consistent with the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of including a fact box with text, this element must be placed where it doesn’t interfere with key visual elements like trees or the bear. The text must be legible and its background must not disrupt natural textures.",
      "question": "Is the fact box positioned in an open area of the image (e.g., near the riverbank) without covering important details like tree trunks or water flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using a modern sans-serif font, the text must appear sharp and consistent with the image resolution. It should not blur, pixelate, or have jagged edges, especially under bright lighting conditions.",
      "question": "Is the text in the speech bubble and fact box rendered with clean edges and no pixelation or aliasing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining realistic color fidelity, particularly blue for water stages and brown-green for forest background, the added elements must match the original palette. Color shifts or unnatural saturation could break visual coherence.",
      "question": "Do the blue hues in the transformation chart and the brown-green tones in the forest background match the original image’s color grading without noticeable shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q9",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving fine details like fur texture and water droplets, the addition of graphics should not erase or blur these features. For example, the bear’s fur should still show individual strands even near overlaid elements.",
      "question": "Are the bear’s fur strands and water splashes still visible and detailed around the added speech bubble and transformation chart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q10",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining a 16:9 aspect ratio, the final composition must not stretch or crop key elements. Both panels should fit proportionally without truncating the bear, river, or trees.",
      "question": "Do both panels occupy their intended regions within the 16:9 frame without cutting off the bear’s legs or the tree line at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
