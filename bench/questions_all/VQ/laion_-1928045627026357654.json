      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the male’s outfit into a plush 3D tee with bold geometric patterns and enlarged collar details, this involves modifying the texture, shape, and material of the shirt. The editing position is the male’s pink patterned t-shirt. This transformation must maintain structural coherence and avoid unnatural textures or distorted geometry. The question evaluates whether the new design retains a natural appearance in terms of surface texture and dimensional consistency.",
      "question": "Does the male's shirt display a consistent 3D plush texture with no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural shading that breaks the illusion of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies enlarging the collar details on the male’s shirt. This alters the proportion and geometry of the neckline. The original image shows a standard crew neck, so any enlargement must preserve anatomical plausibility and avoid stretching or warping. The question checks for structural distortion at the collar area.",
      "question": "Is the collar of the male's shirt proportionally enlarged without distorting the neck or shoulder line, and does it maintain smooth contours without sharp or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The female’s high-waisted pants are to be stylized with exaggerated pleats. The original image shows clean, structured gray pants with minimal folds. Exaggerated pleats require careful rendering to avoid unnatural folding patterns or floating fabric. The question assesses whether the added pleats follow realistic fabric behavior and spatial logic.",
      "question": "Are the pleats on the female's pants symmetrically arranged and physically plausible, without floating or overlapping layers that defy gravity or fabric tension?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires enlarging the sleeve of the female’s top. The original sleeve is short and fitted; enlarging it may affect arm proportions and joint alignment. The question evaluates whether the enlarged sleeve maintains natural arm-to-sleeve relationship and avoids clipping or deformation at the shoulder and wrist.",
      "question": "Does the enlarged sleeve on the female’s top extend naturally from the shoulder without distorting her arm or causing unnatural gaps or overlaps near the elbow and hand?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The overall scene is to be transformed into a chibi-style figurine setup with both characters dancing on a pastel-colored stage. This involves significant background and compositional changes. The original background is neutral gray, and the figures are upright. The question checks whether the new stage environment integrates seamlessly with the characters and maintains visual credibility in scale and lighting.",
      "question": "Is the pastel-colored stage beneath the characters evenly lit and proportionally scaled, with no abrupt color shifts or shadow inconsistencies that suggest poor integration?",
