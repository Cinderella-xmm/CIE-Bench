Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the ruffled collar with an ornate, braided gold necklace, this involves removing the existing lace ruff and introducing a new element at the neck area. The editing position is the upper chest and neck region where the original Elizabethan-style ruff is located. The transformation must maintain structural coherence—ensuring that the new necklace does not appear floating or disconnected from the body, and that its material (gold) integrates naturally with the skin tone and clothing. This evaluation checks whether the replacement maintains natural appearance and avoids artifacts such as unnatural edges or texture mismatches.
Question: Does the gold necklace at the neck area have smooth, continuous lines without jagged edges or pixelation, and does it integrate seamlessly with the surrounding skin and garment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the Tudor-style gown into a luxurious Ancient Greek garment with golden satin and geometric embroidery, the main body of the dress must be altered in both material and pattern. The original black and gold embroidered fabric must be replaced with golden satin featuring classical geometric motifs. This change affects the torso and lower body regions. The evaluation focuses on whether the new fabric appears consistent in texture and reflectivity across the surface, avoiding unnatural sheen or abrupt transitions between areas.
Question: Is the golden satin material on the gown uniformly textured with consistent light reflection, and do the geometric embroidery patterns follow logical symmetry and spacing without distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of altering the sleeves to reveal bare shoulders while embellishing them with classical Greek motifs, the upper arms and shoulder areas must be modified. The original sleeve design with intricate floral patterns must be removed and replaced with bare skin and decorative motifs. This requires checking for anatomical accuracy—such as correct shoulder slope and skin tone continuity—and ensuring that the added motifs are proportionally scaled and positioned as if painted or engraved on the skin. The evaluation ensures no unnatural contours or mismatched textures.
Question: Are the exposed shoulders anatomically accurate with natural skin tone and texture, and are the Greek motifs clearly defined and properly aligned with the shoulder structure without overlapping or warping?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of changing the background tapestry to depict an ancient Grecian landscape with olive trees and marble columns, the entire backdrop behind the figure must be edited. The original dark ornamental tapestry must be replaced with a scene that includes natural elements like trees and architectural structures. The evaluation checks whether the new background has depth, proper lighting consistency with the foreground figure, and spatial coherence—ensuring that the transition between the figure and the background does not show clipping, seams, or color shifts that break visual credibility.
Question: Does the background scene feature coherent lighting, realistic proportions of olive trees and columns, and a seamless integration with the figure’s silhouette without visible edges or misalignment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the overall realism and natural appearance during all transformations, particularly in areas involving hands and accessories (such as the hand resting near the waist), the hand’s anatomy and positioning must remain consistent. The original image shows a hand with five fingers and natural posture. After editing, the hand should retain ergonomic shape, correct finger count, and natural shading. Any deformation, extra digits, or unnatural curvature would compromise structural consistency.
Question: Does the hand near the waist have five distinct fingers with natural joint angles, smooth skin texture, and proper shadowing consistent with the light source, without any added or missing digits?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
