      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the fur with polished walnut wood grain while preserving the original color pattern, this question evaluates whether the wood texture is applied consistently across the pug’s body, particularly on areas like the back, chest, and legs, and whether the grain follows natural wood patterns without appearing stretched, repeated, or artificial. The goal is to assess material authenticity and absence of texture artifacts.",
      "question": "Does the wood grain on the pug's body appear continuous and natural, with no repeating patterns or unnatural stretching, especially along the spine and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of etching facial wrinkles and features to mimic carved wood, this question focuses on the facial region—specifically the forehead, around the eyes, and muzzle—to determine if the engraved lines follow the original anatomical folds and maintain a realistic depth and clarity without jagged edges or over-etching.",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and creases on the pug’s face rendered as smooth, shallow grooves consistent with carved wood, without sharp, broken, or overly deep lines that disrupt the natural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the pug’s original proportions and pose, this question checks whether the transformation preserves the correct anatomy, such as leg length, head size relative to body, and ear placement, ensuring no deformation occurred during the material replacement.",
      "question": "Do the pug’s limbs, head, and torso retain their original proportions and anatomical alignment, with no visible elongation, compression, or misshapen joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts at material boundaries, this question examines the edges where the wood surface meets itself—such as around the neck, jawline, and ear bases—to ensure there are no visible seams, blurring, or color mismatches that suggest poor integration of the new material.",
      "question": "Are the transitions between different parts of the wooden pug (e.g., head to neck, ear to head) seamless, with no visible cracks, ghosting, or color discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the wooden pug on a simple black base, this question evaluates the base’s physical plausibility—its flatness, uniform color, and proper support under the pug—ensuring it is not floating, tilted, or visually disconnected from the figure.",
      "question": "Is the black base beneath the pug flat, uniformly dark, and fully supporting the pug’s feet without any gaps, shadows suggesting suspension, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining consistent lighting and shading for a wooden object, this question assesses whether the highlights and shadows on the wooden pug align with the light source implied by the background, ensuring the material reflects light realistically (e.g., glossy reflections on curved surfaces, soft shadow under the chin).",
      "question": "Do the highlights and shadows on the wooden pug match the ambient lighting of the scene, with reflections and depth appropriate for polished wood rather than fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
