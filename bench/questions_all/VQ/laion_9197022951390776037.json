      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding expressive eyes just below the label, this question evaluates whether the eyes are realistically integrated into the bottle's surface. The eyes must align with the curvature of the bottle, have appropriate shading and reflection matching the glass material, and not appear flat or artificially pasted. Any mismatch in lighting or texture would indicate a lack of natural appearance.",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned just below the label and do they follow the curvature of the bottle with consistent lighting and reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding vines forming limbs, this question checks whether the vines are attached logically to the bottle body and extend outward without breaking geometric continuity. The vines should appear solid and rooted in the bottle, with natural tapering and branching, and not float or clip through the bottle surface.",
      "question": "Do the vines wrap around the bottle in a continuous, physically plausible manner without floating or intersecting the bottle in an unnatural way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the label icon into a curious face, this question assesses whether the facial features are proportionally correct relative to the original icon size and style. The transformation must not distort the original shape or cause blurring or pixelation, especially when enlarging details like eyes or mouth.",
      "question": "Is the modified label icon a clear, proportionate face with distinct features that match the original icon's style and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding an enchanted vineyard backdrop, this question evaluates whether the background elements (grapevines, mist) are layered correctly and respect depth. The mist should fade gradually and not obscure the bottle unevenly, and the vines should not intersect the bottle in a way that violates spatial logic.",
      "question": "Does the background include layered grapevines and mist that recede naturally without obscuring or clipping the bottle incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding the title text, this question checks whether the text is legible, properly aligned, and rendered without artifacts. The font should be sharp, with no jagged edges or color bleed, and placed where it does not interfere with key visual elements like the bottle or vines.",
      "question": "Is the title \"The Curious Scarecrow Wine Adventure\" clearly visible, correctly positioned, and free from rendering artifacts such as pixelation or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
