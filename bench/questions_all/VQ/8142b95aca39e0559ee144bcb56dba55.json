      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the original figure into six progressively smaller chibi-style Russian nesting dolls while preserving proportional consistency and structural coherence, this question evaluates whether the limbs, head, and body proportions of each doll are correctly scaled and aligned without distortion or anatomical errors. Specifically, the smallest doll should not have disproportionately large heads or misshapen limbs compared to the larger ones.",
      "question": "Are all six dolls proportionally scaled with consistent body structure, showing no distorted limbs, oversized heads, or irregular shapes?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that each doll must retain recognizable core elements (beard, headwear, robe patterns) in a simplified chibi style, this question checks whether key features such as the beard, hair knot, and robe patterns are consistently present and accurately rendered across all dolls, without omitting or distorting critical details.",
      "question": "Do all six dolls clearly display the original figureâ€™s beard, headwear, and distinctive robe patterns in a simplified but consistent manner?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the dark-wood desk must be physically plausible and properly integrated into the scene, this question assesses whether the desk has appropriate wood texture, shading, and scale relative to the dolls, and whether it is positioned flatly beneath them without floating or clipping issues.",
      "question": "Is the dark-wood desk textured realistically with visible grain, proper shadows, and correct scale relative to the dolls, and is it fully grounded beneath them without floating or misalignment?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the gentle breeze effect must produce natural fabric sway without artifacts, this question examines whether the robes on the dolls show smooth, flowing motion with curved folds that follow physics, and whether there are any sharp edges, pixelation, or unnatural stretching in the fabric.",
      "question": "Do the robes on the dolls exhibit smooth, curved folds consistent with a breeze, without jagged lines, unnatural stretching, or broken textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that hand anatomy must remain accurate even in chibi form, this question checks whether each doll has no more than five fingers, with natural curvature and spacing, and whether the hands are proportionally sized and positioned realistically relative to the body.",
      "question": "Do all dolls have hands with exactly five fingers, properly shaped and spaced, without extra digits or deformed joints?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that color consistency must be maintained across all dolls using vibrant orange and blue hues, this question evaluates whether the colors are uniformly applied without bleeding, fading, or unintended shifts in tone between dolls, especially in areas like the robe trim and inner lining.",
      "question": "Are the orange and blue colors consistently applied across all six dolls without color bleeding, mismatched tones, or unexpected gradients?",
