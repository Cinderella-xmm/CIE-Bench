      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the sparrow into an adventurous character by adding a tiny explorer hat, evaluate whether the hat is proportionally consistent with the bird's head size and structure, maintains natural material appearance (e.g., fabric or felt-like texture), and does not introduce unnatural edges, warping, or floating elements. The hat must be positioned realistically on the head without distorting the bird’s feathers or facial features.",
      "question": "Is the explorer hat placed correctly on the sparrow’s head, matching its scale and shape without deforming the feathers or creating unnatural shadows or seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a miniature backpack to the sparrow, assess whether the backpack is physically plausible in size and placement—attached naturally to the bird’s back without overlapping wings or body parts incorrectly. Check for realistic material texture (e.g., cloth or leather) and absence of artifacts such as jagged edges or inconsistent lighting.",
      "question": "Does the backpack appear attached to the sparrow’s back with proper alignment and proportion, showing no distortion of feathers or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing oak leaves with a stylized map showing a forest and treasure icons, evaluate whether the new map elements are integrated seamlessly into the scene. Check if the map retains leaf-like shape and positioning relative to the branch, has coherent textures resembling paper or parchment, and includes legible symbols without visual glitches or mismatched lighting.",
      "question": "Are the stylized map elements positioned where the original oak leaves were, maintaining similar shape and spatial relationship to the branch and bird, with no visible seams or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of emphasizing the bird’s fluffy plumage in warm, earthy tones, assess whether the editing preserves the original texture and volume of the feathers. Ensure that color adjustments do not flatten depth, create unnatural highlights, or alter feather direction inconsistently.",
      "question": "Do the sparrow’s feathers retain their original fluffiness and layered texture, with consistent warm earthy tones that enhance but do not distort natural feather patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a whimsical title with swirling elements at the top of the image, evaluate whether the text is properly aligned within the frame, uses a child-friendly font style, and integrates smoothly without overlapping the bird or branch. Check for clarity of letters, uniformity of stroke, and absence of pixelation or blurring.",
      "question": "Is the title text clearly visible at the top of the image, using a playful font with swirling elements that do not interfere with the bird or background, and free from distortion or blur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
