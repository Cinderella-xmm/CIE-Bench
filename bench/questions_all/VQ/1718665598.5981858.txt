Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the road into angular, geometric sections as part of a cubist style, evaluate whether the road’s shape has been fragmented into distinct quadrilateral or polygonal segments that maintain structural coherence and avoid unnatural breaks or distortions. The original road is a smooth, continuous curve; any fragmentation must preserve plausible alignment and continuity without introducing jagged edges or floating pieces.
Question: Are the road sections composed of clearly defined angular shapes that align logically with the perspective and curvature of the original road, without floating or misaligned fragments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of reassembling clouds into overlapping quadrilateral forms, assess whether the cloud structures have been abstracted into flat, geometric planes while maintaining visual plausibility in layering and depth. The original clouds are volumetric and soft-edged; their transformation must not result in unnatural flatness, clipping, or illogical overlaps.
Question: Do the cloud formations consist of layered quadrilateral shapes that overlap in a way consistent with atmospheric depth, without abrupt edges or disconnected blocks?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of stylizing telegraph poles into abstract forms, evaluate whether the poles have been transformed into angular, non-naturalistic shapes (e.g., triangular or trapezoidal cross-sections) while retaining recognizable structure and proportional consistency. The original poles are vertical cylinders with horizontal crossbars; any abstraction should not cause them to appear bent, broken, or physically impossible.
Question: Are the telegraph poles rendered as angular or geometric structures that maintain vertical alignment and proportional relationships between the pole and crossbars, without visible warping or structural collapse?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of abstracting trees into triangular forms, assess whether the foliage has been simplified into sharp-edged triangles or pyramidal shapes that still appear integrated with the ground and sky, avoiding floating or disconnected elements. The original trees are rounded and organic; their transformation must not disrupt spatial grounding or introduce unnatural silhouettes.
Question: Are the tree canopies represented as solid triangular or pyramid-like shapes that sit naturally on the ground and do not float above the terrain or intersect with the road guardrails?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using a muted palette of greens, grays, and deep yellows, evaluate whether the color transitions across the scene—especially on the wet road, sky, and vegetation—are smooth and consistent with the intended cubist aesthetic, avoiding harsh contrasts or unnatural color patches. The original image has natural lighting reflections; the edited version must retain coherent tonal balance without pixelation or texture artifacts.
Question: Are the colors across the road surface, sky, and surrounding vegetation uniformly distributed within the specified muted palette, without isolated bright spots, color bleeding, or textural noise?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
