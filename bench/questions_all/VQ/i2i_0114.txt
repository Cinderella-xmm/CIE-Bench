Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the original desk and character structure, we need to evaluate if the new addition of a modern man in formal attire raises a glass without distorting the existing table arrangement.

Question: Are there any unnatural textures or artifacts visible around the modern man in formal attire that disrupt the natural appearance of the edited image?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: To evaluate if the new element adheres to stylistic continuity and visual credibility within the context of the original painting, we focus on whether the modern man in formal attire blends seamlessly with the rest of the scene, maintaining both the period-specific qualities and the fine details expected in the original artwork.
Question: Does the modern man in formal attire blend seamlessly with the artistic style of the original painting, maintaining consistent line work and shading without introducing visually incongruous elements?

Question: Has the addition of the modern man caused any distortion or damage to the geometric shapes of the table or surrounding characters?
Choices: Yes, No
