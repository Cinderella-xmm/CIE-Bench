      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the dancing woman into a figure from ancient Greek mythology, the editing involves changing her attire from a colorful traditional African dress to a flowing white chiton with gold accents. This transformation affects the material, color, and texture of her clothing. The original image shows a detailed, layered skirt with vibrant colors and distinct patterns. The new chiton must maintain fabric-like realism, including proper draping, folds, and lighting interaction, without unnatural textures or artifacts. Therefore, this question evaluates whether the new garment appears physically plausible and naturally integrated.",
      "question": "Does the white chiton with gold accents on the woman’s body show natural fabric folds and lighting consistency, without visible pixelation, texture repetition, or unnatural stiffness?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies styling the woman’s hair into classical Greek waves adorned with laurel leaves. In the original image, her hair is long, braided, and dynamic, flowing in motion. Replacing it with wavy hair and adding laurel leaves introduces a new hairstyle and foreign elements that must be seamlessly integrated. This requires checking for continuity in hair volume, strand direction, and realistic interaction with light and motion. Additionally, the laurel leaves must appear attached naturally and not floating or misaligned.",
      "question": "Are the classical Greek-style waves and laurel leaves in the woman's hair consistent in shape, density, and lighting with the surrounding environment, and do they avoid unnatural clumping or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The background savannah landscape is to be recast into a golden mythical landscape inspired by classical Greek pottery art. The original image features acacia trees, antelope, and a dramatic sky. The transformation includes altering the color palette to golden tones and applying artistic stylization reminiscent of Greek pottery, such as simplified forms, silhouette outlines, and mythological motifs. This change must preserve structural coherence—trees and animals should remain recognizable but stylized—without introducing geometric distortions or broken shapes.",
      "question": "Do the trees and animals in the background retain recognizable forms while being rendered in a golden, stylized manner consistent with classical Greek pottery art, without distorted proportions or fragmented geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The sky in the original image has dark storm clouds with warm backlighting. The instruction calls for a dramatic, tempestuous sky rendered in the style of classical Greek pottery. This implies a shift toward high-contrast, symbolic representation rather than photorealism. However, the transition must still maintain visual credibility—clouds should not appear stretched, fragmented, or unnaturally layered. The lighting should align with the rest of the scene, particularly how shadows fall on the ground and figures.",
      "question": "Is the sky rendered with coherent cloud formations and directional lighting that matches the overall illumination of the scene, avoiding artificial seams or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The woman’s pose is dynamic, mid-dance, with arms raised and one leg lifted. This action must be preserved in the edited version despite changes in costume and hairstyle. The limbs must maintain anatomical correctness—particularly the hands and feet—ensuring no extra fingers, unnatural joint angles, or warped limbs. The motion of the chiton and hair should follow physical logic, such as flow direction relative to movement and gravity.",
      "question": "Are the woman’s hands and feet anatomically correct, with five fingers per hand and natural joint positioning, and does her posture reflect plausible human motion without deformation or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
