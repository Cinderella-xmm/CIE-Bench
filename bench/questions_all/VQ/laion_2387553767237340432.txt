Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the clay-textured vases into a high-end ceramics brand packaging called "Earth Elegance." This involves changing the material appearance from raw clay to marbled ceramic finish, which affects the surface texture and reflectivity. The original image shows two identical mustard-yellow vases with petal-like leaf structures around the rim and a flared base. These elements must be preserved in structure but altered in material properties. The transformation must maintain geometric integrity while introducing new textures without distorting shapes.
-Sub requirement 1: Replace the original clay texture of both vases with a marbled ceramic finish that maintains structural coherence and avoids unnatural texture artifacts such as blotches or inconsistent patterns.
-Sub requirement 2: Add subtle branding decals on the vases (likely near the base or rim) without disrupting the organic form or introducing visual inconsistencies in color or scale.
-Sub requirement 3: Introduce gold leaf accents on selected petal edges or base contoursâ€”these must align with lighting and material logic to appear physically plausible.
-Sub requirement 4: Design a matte black packaging box featuring a cross-sectional view of the vase interiors with an artichoke-like pattern; this must be composited accurately with correct perspective and proportion relative to the vases.
-Sub requirement 5: Ensure bronze typography on the box is legible, properly scaled, and positioned consistently with the design theme, avoiding misalignment or distortion.
-Sub requirement 6: Maintain the original vase proportions and symmetry during all edits to preserve structural consistency and visual credibility.
-Sub requirement 7: Avoid introducing digital artifacts such as jagged edges, ghosting, or unnatural highlights when applying new materials or overlays.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the clay texture with a marbled ceramic finish, evaluate whether the new surface texture appears uniform and physically plausible across both vases. The marbling should follow natural stone-like flow patterns without breaking the shape or introducing pixelation or unevenness.
Question: Does the marbled ceramic finish on both vases display consistent, smooth patterns without visible texture breaks or artificial repetitions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding branding decals, assess whether any logos or text are present on the vases in a way that respects the curvature and does not cause warping or stretching. The decals should be small and integrated seamlessly into the design.
Question: Are the branding decals applied to the vases clearly visible, proportionally sized, and aligned with the surface curvature without distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding gold leaf accents, check whether the gold elements are placed along petal edges or base contours in a way that follows light direction and material reflection rules. They should not appear flat or disconnected from the underlying surface.
Question: Do the gold leaf accents on the vases show realistic highlights and edge definition consistent with metallic foil applied to curved surfaces?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of designing a packaging box with a cross-sectional view of the vase interior, verify that the illustration inside the box matches the actual internal structure of the vases, including the artichoke-like pattern. The cross-section must be rendered with correct depth and alignment.
Question: Is the cross-sectional illustration on the packaging box accurately depicting the internal petal arrangement of the vases without geometric mismatch or incorrect layering?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of incorporating bronze typography on a matte black box, assess whether the text is sharp, correctly spaced, and positioned within the frame without clipping or shadow artifacts. The contrast between bronze and black should be clean.
Question: Is the bronze typography on the packaging box legible, evenly spaced, and free from blurring or unwanted shadows?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency, evaluate whether the overall shape and proportions of both vases remain unchanged after editing. Any scaling or deformation would compromise realism.
Question: Are the two vases still symmetrical and proportionally accurate compared to the original, with no stretched or compressed sections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
