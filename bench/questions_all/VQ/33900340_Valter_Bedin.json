      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the medieval structure into a colossal stone golem using archways as articulated limbs, evaluate whether the structural transformation maintains geometric coherence and physical plausibility. The original image features a tall tower with an arched opening and battlements; these elements must be reinterpreted as limbs and a crown without breaking their inherent architectural form or introducing distorted shapes.",
      "question": "Do the archways in the tower appear as articulated limbs with natural joint-like transitions, preserving their original arch shape and avoiding unnatural bends or breaks in geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the wall texture with glowing ancient glyphs, assess whether the new surface details are seamlessly integrated and do not introduce artificial patterns or texture inconsistencies. The original brickwork has a rough, aged appearance; overlaying glyphs should maintain material consistency while adding luminous detail without disrupting the structural integrity.",
      "question": "Are the glowing glyphs evenly distributed across the stone surface, matching the texture of the original masonry and lacking jagged edges, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of silhouetting the figure against the sky and turning shadowed areas into a mystical aura, determine whether the lighting transition from dark to luminous is smooth and physically plausible. The original image has strong contrast between light and shadow; the edited version should replace shadows with a soft glow without creating harsh boundaries or unnatural gradients.",
      "question": "Is the transition from dark shadowed areas to the mystical aura around the structure gradual and continuous, without sharp discontinuities or floating light effects that lack grounding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the small human figure into a luminous guide wisp, evaluate whether the new form retains visual credibility by appearing as a translucent, ethereal entity rather than a solid object. The original figure is a person walking a dog; this must be replaced with a glowing, non-physical presence that still occupies the same spatial location.",
      "question": "Does the luminous guide wisp occupy the same position as the original figure and dog, maintaining proportional scale and spatial alignment, while exhibiting a translucent, wispy texture without solid edges or anatomical features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of positioning the golem silhouette against the sky with enhanced mystical aura, assess whether the overall composition preserves depth and perspective. The original image uses depth cues through receding walls and arches; the edited version must maintain these cues even with added glow and stylization.",
      "question": "Are the foreground, midground, and background elements still perceptually layered with correct depth relationships, so that the golem appears to stand within the space rather than floating above or behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
