      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the jeans into a perfume bottle with a flared leg silhouette using transparent glass tinted with denim blue, evaluate whether the material transition from denim to glass maintains visual credibility and natural appearance. The editing position is the entire lower body of the jeans, particularly focusing on the flared leg shape which now serves as the bottle's form. The key concern is whether the texture and transparency of the glass appear consistent with the original denim structure, especially in areas like seams and folds.",
      "question": "Does the transparent glass material retain the denim blue tint without unnatural color bleeding or inconsistent opacity across the surface?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the back pockets with embossed metallic branding, assess whether the new elements are seamlessly integrated into the original design. The editing position is the rear waist area where the original back pockets were located. The focus is on whether the metallic texture appears realistic, properly aligned with the contour of the jeans, and does not introduce distortions such as misaligned edges or unnatural reflections.",
      "question": "Are the embossed metallic branding elements positioned correctly over the original back pocket area without distorting the surrounding fabric or creating visible seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a silver button-styled cap at the top of the jeans (now functioning as the perfume bottle’s cap), evaluate whether this addition conforms to physical logic and structural consistency. The editing position is the waistband area where the button would be placed. The concern is whether the cap matches the scale and proportion of the bottle, and whether it appears naturally attached without floating or misalignment.",
      "question": "Is the silver button-shaped cap properly aligned with the waistband and securely attached without gaps or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating lace-up details along the side as a decorative element, evaluate whether these laces maintain natural proportions and correct placement relative to the original jeans’ stitching. The editing position is the outer side of each leg near the flare, where the original lace-up detail was added. The focus is on whether the laces appear physically plausible—correctly threaded, tied, and integrated into the fabric without breaking geometric continuity.",
      "question": "Do the lace-up details on both legs have symmetrical threading and bow knots that follow the natural curve of the leg without distortion or clipping through the fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence between the transformed jeans and the new perfume bottle design, evaluate whether the overall silhouette remains visually coherent. The editing position spans the full length of the jeans, now shaped like a bottle with a flared base. The concern is whether the transformation preserves the original proportions and avoids unnatural stretching, warping, or broken geometry, especially at the transition points between the upper and lower sections.",
      "question": "Does the flared leg section maintain smooth, continuous curvature without sharp breaks, pixelation, or stretched textures indicating geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
