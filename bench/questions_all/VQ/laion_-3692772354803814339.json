      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the bottle glass into swirling ocean waves encased in transparent crystal, evaluate whether the new material maintains transparency, refractive properties, and fluid-like motion without breaking the original bottleâ€™s geometric structure. Focus on the body of the bottle where the waves are most prominent.",
      "question": "Are the swirling ocean wave patterns inside the crystal bottle smooth, continuous, and free of jagged edges or unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the label with intricate golden maritime symbols, assess whether the new design fits the label area proportionally and retains fine detail without blurring or aliasing. The symbols must be legible and stylistically consistent with maritime themes.",
      "question": "Do the golden maritime symbols on the bottle label occupy the correct area, maintain sharp edges, and show no signs of pixelation or smudging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the packaging into ancient mariner scrolls with a compass rose, examine the top of the cylinder to determine if the compass rose is properly formed with symmetrical arms and metallic points that reflect light naturally.",
      "question": "Does the compass rose at the top of the packaging have evenly spaced metallic points with realistic reflections and no misalignment or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency during material transformation, check the neck and shoulder region of the bottle where the glass transitions into crystal with waves. Ensure the curvature remains smooth and physically plausible.",
      "question": "Is the transition from the bottle neck to the wave-patterned body seamless, with no abrupt breaks or geometric deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving visual credibility in the packaging transformation, verify that the parchment-like texture of the scroll appears uniformly aged and that the textural contrast between the parchment and metallic compass points is natural.",
      "question": "Does the parchment surface of the packaging display consistent aging texture without artificial streaks or uneven shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
