Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires converting the scene to a stylized comic book look with bold outlines and dynamic action lines. This involves altering the visual style of the entire image, including the player, basketball, court, hoop, and background crowd. The transformation must preserve structural coherence while introducing stylistic elements such as outlines and motion lines. Attention must be paid to whether these additions distort anatomical features (e.g., limbs, hands), disrupt geometric shapes (e.g., basketball, hoop), or introduce unnatural textures. The conversion should not degrade fine details like facial features, fabric folds, or shadows.
-Sub requirement 1: Apply bold outlines across all major elements (player, ball, hoop, court) without distorting their original shapes or causing misalignment between outline and object boundary.
-Sub requirement 2: Add dynamic action lines around the player and ball to suggest motion; ensure they follow plausible physical trajectories and do not intersect objects unrealistically.
-Sub requirement 3: Enhance colors using vibrant red and orange hues; verify that color enhancement does not result in oversaturation, banding, or loss of detail in skin tone, jersey texture, or court surface.
-Sub requirement 4: Introduce retro-inspired text overlays indicating a fictional game title; confirm placement does not obscure key elements and maintains legibility without visual clutter.
-Sub requirement 5: Frame the postcard with a classic comic panel border; check that the border is evenly aligned, consistent in thickness, and does not interfere with the composition or crop essential content.
-Sub requirement 6: Ensure all modifications maintain structural consistency—especially the player’s pose, hand grip on the ball, and spatial relationship between the player and hoop—so that no parts appear stretched, compressed, or misplaced.
-Sub requirement 7: Evaluate whether the hand holding the basketball has five fingers, correct proportions, natural joint angles, and proper interaction with the ball surface (no clipping or floating digits).
-Sub requirement 8: Confirm that the basketball retains its spherical shape and textured surface under stylization, avoiding flattening or warping due to outline or shading effects.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of applying bold outlines across all major elements without distorting their original shapes, this question evaluates whether the outlines accurately follow the contours of the player, basketball, hoop, and court. Misaligned or jagged outlines could break the illusion of form and reduce visual credibility.
Question: Do the bold outlines precisely trace the edges of the player, basketball, hoop, and court without overlapping or cutting into the underlying forms?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding dynamic action lines to suggest motion, this question checks if the lines are placed along plausible directions of movement (e.g., trailing behind the player and ball) and do not pass through solid objects or contradict physics.
Question: Are the dynamic action lines positioned along the direction of motion and do they avoid intersecting solid objects like the player’s body or the basketball?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of enhancing colors with vibrant red and orange hues, this question assesses whether the color saturation remains within natural limits and preserves texture details in skin, jersey, and court materials.
Question: Are the red and orange hues applied consistently across the image without causing visible color bleeding, banding, or loss of detail in areas such as the jersey fabric, skin tone, or wooden floor?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing retro-inspired text overlays, this question evaluates whether the text is readable, properly spaced, and does not obstruct critical visual elements like the player’s face or the basketball.
Question: Is the text overlay clearly legible, positioned outside the main subject area, and not covering any essential part of the player or basketball?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of framing the image with a comic panel border, this question checks whether the border is uniform in width, aligned with the image edges, and does not cut off any part of the scene.
Question: Is the comic panel border evenly drawn around the entire image, maintaining consistent thickness and not cropping any part of the player, hoop, or background?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving structural consistency in the player’s pose and interaction with the basketball, this question focuses on the anatomical accuracy of the hand gripping the ball—specifically finger count, spacing, and contact points.
Question: Does the hand holding the basketball have exactly five fingers, correctly proportioned and naturally curved around the ball, with no extra digits or unnatural gaps?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q7: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the basketball’s spherical shape and texture under stylization, this question verifies that the ball remains round, with consistent curvature and visible seams, even after applying bold outlines or shading.
Question: Is the basketball fully spherical with visible seam lines and no flattened or distorted regions despite the comic-style rendering?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
