      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the book illustration into a snow globe while maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility, we need to assess if the transformation introduces any unnatural textures or artifacts. The original image contains a simple, clean illustration of an open book which should now appear as a compact, chibi-style 3D design inside the snow globe.",
      "question": "Does the compact, chibi-style 3D book inside the snow globe maintain its structural integrity without any broken geometric shapes or unnatural textures?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Considering the sub requirement of ensuring the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the scene, we need to evaluate if the addition of the snow globe, shelf, surrounding books, and library backdrop blends seamlessly with the original image's aesthetic. The original image has a minimalist design, so the new elements should complement rather than clash with it.",
      "question": "Do the added elements like the snow globe, shelf, surrounding books, and library backdrop integrate naturally with the original minimalist design without disrupting the overall visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "According to the sub requirement of avoiding distortion and maintaining physical rationality, we need to check if the proportions of the snow globe, the chibi-style book, and the surrounding objects are consistent and realistic. The original image's book was a central element, so its transformed version should retain a similar prominence within the new scene.",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the snow globe, the chibi-style book, and the surrounding objects physically rational and consistent with the original image's central focus on the book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Given the sub requirement of preserving the natural appearance and avoiding obvious artifacts, we need to examine if the soft golden light from the nearby lamp and the resulting sparkles cast by the snow globe look authentic and enhance the scene's warmth. The original image had a neutral tone, so the new lighting should add depth without creating unrealistic shadows or highlights.",
      "question": "Does the soft golden light from the nearby lamp and the sparkles cast by the snow globe appear natural and enhance the scene's warmth without introducing unrealistic shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "In line with the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility, we need to verify if the snowy environment inside the snow globe, along with the gently fluttering pages, looks believable and adds to the magical atmosphere. The original image's open book should now convincingly transform into a 3D object within this new setting.",
      "question": "Does the snowy environment inside the snow globe, along with the gently fluttering pages of the chibi-style book, look believable and contribute to the magical atmosphere without appearing forced or out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
