      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the woman's dress into an elaborate pastel gown with intricate lace and floral embroidery, this involves replacing the current gray tulle gown. The original dress has a layered ruffled structure and a defined silhouette, so the new gown must maintain structural coherence in terms of volume, layering, and proportion. The editing must preserve natural fabric draping and avoid unnatural textures or distorted folds.",
      "question": "Does the newly added pastel gown maintain consistent fabric texture and realistic layering without visible seams, pixelation, or unnatural creases?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a powdered wig to match the Rococo era, the original image shows the woman’s dark hair styled in an updo. Replacing it with a powdered wig requires accurate integration with the head shape, facial proportions, and lighting. The wig must not appear misaligned, unnaturally voluminous, or detached from the head.",
      "question": "Is the powdered wig properly aligned with the head shape and facial features, showing natural volume and no floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of accessorizing with pearls, the original image shows a simple necklace. Adding pearl jewelry such as earrings, necklaces, or bracelets must integrate seamlessly with the skin tone and clothing, avoiding harsh edges or color mismatches. The pearls should reflect light naturally and conform to typical material properties.",
      "question": "Are the added pearl accessories rendered with consistent lighting and surface reflection, showing no unnatural highlights or ghosting around the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reimagining the pose into a graceful dance position, the original image shows the woman mid-twirl with one arm extended. The new pose must retain anatomical plausibility—especially in limb positioning, joint angles, and balance. Any distortion in the arms, legs, or torso would compromise visual credibility.",
      "question": "Does the edited pose maintain anatomically correct limb positions and joint angles, with no bent fingers, stretched limbs, or impossible body contortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of setting the scene in an opulent ballroom with gold-accented decor and chandeliers, the original background is an outdoor gravel path with greenery. Replacing it with an indoor ballroom environment must preserve spatial logic, depth, and lighting consistency. The transition between the subject and background should not show mismatched shadows, lighting direction, or scale discrepancies.",
      "question": "Is the background ballroom environment visually consistent with the subject in terms of lighting direction, shadow alignment, and perspective, without obvious blending artifacts or scale distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
