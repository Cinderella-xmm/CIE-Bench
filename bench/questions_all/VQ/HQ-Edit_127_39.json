      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the spire with an energy crown, this change occurs at the very top of the Eiffel Tower. The original spire is a slender metallic structure; the new energy crown must maintain a proportional and balanced shape relative to the rest of the tower. Any asymmetry, floating elements, or misalignment with the tower’s axis would compromise structural coherence. The crown should also emit light in a way that matches ambient lighting and does not create unnatural glows or clipping artifacts.",
      "question": "Is the energy crown at the top of the Eiffel Tower symmetrically aligned with the tower’s central axis and does it cast consistent light without visible rendering artifacts?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the iron lattice into a cybernetic cloak, the entire outer framework of the tower must retain its original triangular and arch-based geometry while being transformed. The edit must avoid stretching, warping, or breaking of the lattice beams. If the structure appears to flow unnaturally or loses its rigid skeletal form, it violates physical plausibility.",
      "question": "Are the iron lattice girders of the Eiffel Tower preserved in their original geometric configuration, with no signs of bending, stretching, or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding luminescent circuitry, the glow must follow logical paths along the tower’s surface, resembling real electrical traces. The circuitry should not appear as random patches or float above the surface. It must interact with the tower’s shadows and ambient light, and the glow should not cause halos or color bleeding.",
      "question": "Do the luminescent circuits run continuously along the tower’s surface without floating above it, and do they emit light that blends naturally with the surrounding illumination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding digital glyphs on the girders, these symbols must be clearly rendered and evenly spaced, without overlapping or distorting the underlying metalwork. They should not appear as separate layers that don’t conform to the curvature of the beams.",
      "question": "Are the digital glyphs embedded into the girders without causing visible displacement or deformation of the metal structure beneath them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding holographic elements, these must appear semi-transparent, layered in depth, and responsive to perspective. Static or flat overlays would break immersion. Holograms should not clip through solid parts of the tower or appear as flickering pixels.",
      "question": "Do the holographic elements appear translucent and layered with depth, and do they avoid intersecting solid parts of the tower or showing pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing pixelated energy barriers at the base, these must surround the tower’s foundation without floating or appearing disconnected from the ground. The pixelation should be consistent and not jagged or blurred, maintaining a coherent barrier-like appearance.",
      "question": "Are the pixelated energy barriers positioned directly around the base of the tower and do they have sharp, consistent edges without blurring or floating above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of giving the tower digital eyes, the placement must be plausible within the structure—likely near the observation decks or upper levels. The eyes should emit a focused glow that interacts with nearby surfaces and does not appear as unconnected light sources.",
      "question": "Are the digital eyes located in a position consistent with the tower’s architecture and do they emit light that casts soft shadows and reflects off adjacent surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
