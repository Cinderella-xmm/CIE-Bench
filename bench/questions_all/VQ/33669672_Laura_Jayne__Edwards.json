      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of evaluating limb elongation for anatomical plausibility and structural consistency, this question checks whether the arms and legs have been stretched in a way that maintains natural proportions and joint alignment. The original image shows a dynamic pose with extended limbs; any distortion in length or angle could break physical logic.",
      "question": "Are the limbs proportionally elongated without visible kinks, unnatural bends, or disconnected segments?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing floral elements with geometric patterns, this question assesses whether the new patterns integrate seamlessly with the boot design and maintain consistent texture and scale. The original image has flowers attached to the boots and legs; these must be replaced without leaving gaps or misaligned shapes.",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the boots and leg areas uniformly applied with clean edges and no overlapping or fragmented sections?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting materials to a bronze-like metallic finish, this question evaluates whether the skin, clothing, and boots exhibit consistent metallic texture, reflectivity, and shading. The original image has organic textures (fabric, skin, flowers); the edited version should show uniform metallic properties across all surfaces.",
      "question": "Do all body parts, including the skin, dress, and boots, display a consistent metallic sheen with smooth gradients and no patches of mismatched material?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining color harmony with the turquoise background and metallic tones, this question checks whether the edited image retains a cohesive color scheme without unwanted hues or lighting inconsistencies. The original image uses a strong turquoise backdrop; the bronze tones should complement it without clashing.",
      "question": "Is the color palette limited to metallic tones and turquoise, with no unexpected color bleed or desaturation in the figure or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving the dynamic pose with natural joint articulation, this question examines whether the posture remains fluid and biomechanically plausible after stylization. The original image shows a balanced, expressive stance; the edited version should not appear stiff or mechanically rigid.",
      "question": "Does the figure's pose maintain natural weight distribution and joint angles, with no floating limbs or unnatural overlaps?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring accurate hand representation under stylization, this question checks whether the extended hand retains five fingers with proper spacing, curvature, and alignment. The original image shows a clearly defined hand; even in a sculptural form, the number and shape of fingers must remain anatomically correct.",
      "question": "Does the extended hand have exactly five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, without extra digits or fused joints?",
