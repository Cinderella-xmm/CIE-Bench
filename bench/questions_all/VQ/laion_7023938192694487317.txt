Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the individual's torso and attire into an oversized figurine with a stylized athletic jersey, evaluate whether the transformation maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows a person wearing a black long-sleeve shirt with a "Craft" logo on the shoulder and a "Z healthcare" logo on the chest. The editing involves changing this into a figurine-like representation with exaggerated proportions. This requires checking if the torso appears proportionally enlarged without geometric distortion or unnatural scaling.
Question: Does the torso appear uniformly scaled and proportionally enlarged without visible warping or stretching of anatomical features such as shoulders, neck, or waist?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using matte-finished black polymer for the shirt, assess whether the material texture of the shirt in the edited image matches the described finish. The original shirt has a smooth, slightly reflective fabric appearance. In the edited version, it should be replaced with a non-reflective, matte surface consistent with polymer material. Any residual shine or fabric-like texture would indicate failure to meet the material specification.
Question: Is the surface of the shirt uniformly matte with no glossy highlights or fabric weave patterns, indicating a polymer-like finish?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of emphasizing the "Craft" logo with elevated, bold colors, evaluate whether the logo has been enhanced in color saturation and dimensionality while remaining visually coherent. The original logo is white with small dots; in the edited image, it should appear more prominent and possibly raised, but not distorted or misaligned relative to the shirtâ€™s structure.
Question: Is the "Craft" logo clearly visible, elevated in appearance, and rendered in bold colors without blurring, misalignment, or clipping at its edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a detachable base resembling a sleek, contemporary stand made of polished metal with subtle reflection, assess whether the base is present, structurally plausible, and visually consistent with the description. It must be positioned beneath the figurine, have clean geometric lines, and show soft reflections appropriate for polished metal. Any jagged edges, unnatural shadows, or lack of reflectivity would compromise authenticity.
Question: Is the base under the figurine composed of clean, straight lines with smooth surfaces and subtle reflective highlights consistent with polished metal, and does it appear physically attached yet separable?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving the core elements (such as facial features and glasses) while modifying the body into a figurine, evaluate whether the head and upper face retain natural proportions and textures. The original image shows clear facial details including beard, glasses, and skin tone. These should remain unchanged and seamlessly integrated with the transformed torso to maintain visual credibility.
Question: Are the facial features, including eyes, beard, glasses, and skin texture, preserved without distortion, blurring, or unnatural blending at the junction with the modified torso?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
