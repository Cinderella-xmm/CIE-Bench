Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction specifies transforming the original image into a cartoon-style fashion art postcard with exaggerated floral embroidery, vibrant colors, and stylized jade-patterned clasps. The original image features a woman in a red qipao with gold floral embroidery, blue piping, and traditional frog closures. The transformation involves altering the style of the embroidery, changing the clasp design, adding detachable writing sections on silk-like backgrounds with gold foil borders, and applying a cartoon aesthetic. These changes affect multiple regions: the floral patterns on the qipao, the clasp mechanism, the overall texture and color saturation, and the addition of new elements (writing sections). Each of these areas must be evaluated for structural coherence, material plausibility, and absence of artifacts under the new artistic style while maintaining visual credibility.

-Sub requirement 1: Modify the floral embroidery on the qipao to an exaggerated cartoon style—evaluate whether the enlarged or stylized flowers retain coherent shapes and avoid unnatural distortions such as broken petals or inconsistent proportions.
-Sub requirement 2: Replace the traditional frog closures with intricate jade-patterned clasps—assess whether the new clasp design maintains geometric integrity and appears plausible within the cartoon context without warping or misalignment.
-Sub requirement 3: Apply vibrant, cartoon-style coloring across the entire outfit—check if the color shifts are uniform and do not introduce banding, oversaturation, or unnatural gradients that disrupt realism even in stylized form.
-Sub requirement 4: Insert detachable writing sections on vibrant silk backgrounds with gold foil borders—verify that these added elements have clean edges, consistent texture, and proper spatial placement relative to the qipao, avoiding floating or misaligned components.
-Sub requirement 5: Ensure the hand position and gesture remain anatomically correct and natural despite the stylization—confirm that the number of fingers is five, joints are properly aligned, and skin texture remains smooth and unaltered by editing artifacts.
-Sub requirement 6: Maintain overall structural consistency between the edited elements and the original figure—ensure no parts appear detached, stretched, or misproportioned due to style conversion.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of modifying the floral embroidery to an exaggerated cartoon style, this question evaluates whether the enlarged floral patterns maintain coherent shapes and avoid distortions such as irregular petal outlines, missing details, or unnatural stretching. The editing target is the embroidered flowers on the front and sleeves of the qipao.
Question: Are the floral patterns on the qipao clearly defined with consistent outlines and no broken or distorted petals?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the traditional frog closures with jade-patterned clasps, this question checks whether the new clasp design retains geometric precision and appears integrated into the garment without misalignment or clipping artifacts. The editing target is the closure area at the center front of the qipao.
Question: Do the jade-patterned clasps align correctly along the central seam and display consistent shape and size without deformation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of applying vibrant cartoon-style coloring, this question assesses whether the color application across the qipao avoids unnatural gradients, pixelation, or oversaturation that could suggest digital artifacting. The editing target includes the entire fabric surface, especially the red base and decorative elements.
Question: Is the color distribution across the qipao uniform, with no visible banding or abrupt transitions between hues?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of inserting detachable writing sections with gold foil borders on silk backgrounds, this question evaluates whether the added elements are cleanly rendered, properly positioned, and visually distinct from the main garment without appearing floating or misaligned. The editing target is any newly inserted panel or section near the qipao.
Question: Are the detachable writing sections placed with clean edges and consistent lighting, and do they appear anchored to the garment rather than floating?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving anatomical accuracy in the hand, this question checks whether the hand's structure remains intact with five fingers, natural joint alignment, and no distortion caused by editing. The editing target is the right hand holding the qipao near the chest.
Question: Does the hand show five fingers with normal spacing, natural curvature, and no extra or missing digits?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency, this question evaluates whether the overall composition of the edited image preserves logical proportions and spatial relationships between the figure and added elements. The editing target is the full figure and surrounding space.
Question: Are all elements of the qipao and added components proportionally balanced and spatially coherent without stretching or compression?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
