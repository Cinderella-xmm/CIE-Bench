Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the overall realism and natural appearance while blending the front and side views, we need to ensure that the sofa retains its structural consistency without any unnatural deformation or artifacts.
Question: Does the sofa maintain its structural integrity and proportions from both the front and side views, avoiding any unusual geometric distortions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: To evaluate if the blending of the front and side views introduces any unnatural textures or loss of fine details, we need to carefully examine the texture and detail of the sofa's fabric in both views.
Question: Are the fabric textures and details of the sofa consistent and clear in both the front and side views, without any visible loss of detail or unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: The structural coherence between the front and side views should be seamless, ensuring a visually plausible combination. This requires examining the alignment of elements like cushions and legs from both perspectives.
Question: Do the cushions and legs of the sofa align naturally between the front and side views, maintaining visual plausibility and coherence?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: For the blending of the two views to appear authentic, the light and shadow effects must remain consistent across both perspectives, avoiding any anomalies that could disrupt the natural appearance.
Question: Do the light and shadow effects on the sofa and surrounding area remain consistent and natural when transitioning from the front to the side view?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The background elements, such as the painting and wall, should also blend seamlessly with the altered perspective, maintaining their realism and contributing to the overall authenticity of the scene.
Question: Does the artwork on the wall and the wall itself retain their natural appearance and realism when viewed from both the front and side perspectives?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
