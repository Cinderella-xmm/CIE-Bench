Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction requires transforming the jeweled butterfly into a plush toy using soft fabrics. This involves replacing the gemstone details with embroidered patterns in vibrant blues and golds, changing the material from hard, reflective gemstones to soft, textile-based textures. The original image shows a butterfly with intricate gemstone placement on its wings and body, including clear, blue, and dark stones arranged in symmetrical patterns. The transformation must preserve the butterfly's overall shape while altering surface materials and textures. Key areas for evaluation include the wings (both upper and lower), body, antennae, and edge textures. The replacement of gemstones with embroidery must not distort the geometric structure or introduce unnatural texture transitions. The use of velvety material for wings and fluffy edges must maintain plausible fabric behavior and avoid visual inconsistencies such as sharp edges or non-soft textures. The new positioning on a plain pearl-white cushion adds a background element that must be visually coherent with the plush object. Therefore, sub requirements are derived based on material change, structural preservation, texture realism, and compositional logic.

-Sub requirement 1: Replace gemstone details with embroidered patterns in vibrant blues and golds across the entire butterfly surface—evaluate whether this substitution maintains structural coherence and avoids unnatural texture transitions between stitched areas and surrounding fabric.
-Sub requirement 2: Replace the metallic gold base of the butterfly with soft fabric material—assess whether the new material appears pliable and consistent with textile properties, without retaining rigid or reflective characteristics.
-Sub requirement 3: Apply velvety material to the wings—check if the texture appears uniformly soft, matte, and appropriate for velvet, avoiding glossy or crystalline artifacts.
-Sub requirement 4: Add fluffy texture along the wing edges—verify that the fluff is evenly distributed, physically plausible, and does not appear artificially pasted or distorted.
-Sub requirement 5: Maintain the butterfly’s original shape and proportions—ensure no deformation occurs in wing curvature, body length, or antennae alignment during material transformation.
-Sub requirement 6: Position the plush butterfly atop a plain pearl-white cushion—confirm that the cushion has smooth, uniform color and texture, and that the butterfly rests naturally without floating or unnatural shadowing.
-Sub requirement 7: Ensure all embroidered patterns follow the original gemstone layout—validate that the design retains symmetry and alignment with the original butterfly’s pattern, avoiding misaligned or skewed stitches.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing gemstone details with embroidered patterns in vibrant blues and golds across the butterfly’s wings and body, this question evaluates whether the embroidery accurately follows the original gemstone layout and maintains natural stitching appearance. The specific editing position includes the wing surfaces and body, where gemstones were originally placed in clusters and lines. The transition from reflective crystals to thread-based patterns must not introduce jagged edges or mismatched colors.
Question: Are the embroidered patterns on the butterfly’s wings and body aligned with the original gemstone positions and do they display consistent thread density and color without visible breaks or misalignments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the metallic gold base with soft fabric material, this question checks whether the material transition from rigid metal to textile is believable. The original butterfly has a defined gold outline and frame; in the edited version, this should now appear as part of a fabric structure. The focus is on whether the material looks flexible and non-reflective, consistent with textile, rather than retaining metallic sheen or rigidity.
Question: Does the butterfly’s body and frame appear made of soft fabric with no visible metallic shine or rigid edges, and does it show natural fabric folds or drape?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of applying velvety material to the wings, this question assesses whether the texture appears uniformly soft and matte, consistent with velvet. The original wings have a highly reflective, faceted surface due to gemstones; the edited version must replace this with a non-reflective, slightly textured surface typical of velvet. The evaluation focuses on the wing surfaces to ensure no residual gloss or crystal-like highlights remain.
Question: Do the wing surfaces exhibit a uniform, matte, soft-textured appearance consistent with velvet, with no shiny spots or reflections resembling gemstones?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding fluffy texture along the wing edges, this question evaluates whether the fluff is evenly applied and physically plausible. The original butterfly has sharp, clean wing tips; in the edited version, these edges should be softened with fluffy trim. The focus is on whether the fluff appears natural, not artificially layered or clumped, and whether it adheres smoothly to the wing contours.
Question: Is the fluffy trim along the wing edges evenly distributed, soft, and attached in a way that follows the wing’s natural curve without appearing detached or uneven?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the butterfly’s original shape and proportions, this question checks whether the transformation preserves the butterfly’s structural integrity. The original butterfly has symmetrical wings, a defined body, and curved antennae. The edited version must retain these features without distortion, such as warped wings or disproportionate body size.
Question: Are the butterfly’s wings symmetrically shaped, the body proportionate to the wings, and the antennae correctly positioned and curved, with no visible warping or scaling errors?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the plush butterfly atop a plain pearl-white cushion, this question evaluates the visual credibility of the composition. The cushion must appear flat, uniformly colored, and positioned beneath the butterfly in a way that suggests support. The focus is on whether the butterfly casts a natural shadow and sits flush on the surface without floating or unnatural gaps.
Question: Is the butterfly resting on a smooth, uniformly pearl-white cushion with a natural shadow underneath, indicating proper contact and physical grounding?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
