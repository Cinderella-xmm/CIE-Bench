      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the figure into a chibi-style character with an oversized head, this question evaluates whether the head-to-body proportion is exaggerated but maintains structural coherence. The original image has a normal adult head size; the edited version must show a significantly larger head relative to the body while preserving facial symmetry and avoiding unnatural warping.",
      "question": "Is the head disproportionately large compared to the body but without stretched or compressed facial features?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of emphasizing facial features and hair texture, this question checks whether facial details such as eyes, nose, and mouth remain clearly defined and anatomically consistent after enlargement. The original image shows fine details like eyelashes, skin pores, and hair strands; these should be preserved or enhanced in a believable way.",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) clearly visible and proportionally accurate despite the enlarged head?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of retaining the original shirt's striped pattern in a vibrant form, this question assesses whether the red and white stripes on the dark blue shirt are accurately reproduced and aligned. The original shirt has vertical stripes with consistent spacing and color saturation; the edited version must reflect this without misalignment or color bleeding.",
      "question": "Do the stripes on the shirt maintain consistent width, alignment, and color accuracy across the collar and chest area?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of shaping the figure from smooth, glossy enamel, this question evaluates whether the surface of the character appears uniformly shiny and free of texture noise or edge artifacts. The material should look like polished enamel, with soft reflections and no pixelation or jagged lines.",
      "question": "Does the surface of the figure appear smooth and reflective, with no visible texture artifacts or rough edges?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of setting the figure against a bright, pastel-colored background, this question checks whether the background is evenly colored and free of gradients, shadows, or blending errors. The original background is neutral gray; the edited version should replace it with a solid pastel hue without introducing visual noise or depth inconsistencies.",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform pastel color with no gradients, shadows, or blending artifacts near the figure's edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of including playful, exaggerated expressions, this question evaluates whether the facial expression has been altered to appear more animated (e.g., widened eyes, smiling mouth) but remains within anatomical plausibility. The original expression is neutral; the edited version should show increased expressiveness without distorting facial muscles or contours.",
      "question": "Is the facial expression more animated than the original (e.g., wider eyes, open mouth) but still anatomically consistent and not distorted?",
