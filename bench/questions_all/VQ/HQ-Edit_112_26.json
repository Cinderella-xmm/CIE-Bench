      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the cat into a collectible figurine box design titled \"Majestic Window\" in isometric view, evaluate whether the overall structure of the edited image maintains geometric coherence and visual plausibility. The original image features a Siamese cat sitting upright on a wooden windowsill with a clear perspective. The transformation to an isometric view requires repositioning and restructuring elements while preserving spatial logic. This involves checking if the box form retains correct proportions and angles relative to the surrounding environment.",
      "question": "Does the isometric representation of the figurine box maintain consistent angles and edges without distorted or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of styling the box with floral-themed accents, assess whether the added floral elements are integrated naturally into the design. In the original image, there is a vase with pink flowers on the right side of the windowsill. The editing instruction implies incorporating similar floral motifs into the box design. The evaluation focuses on whether these floral accents appear seamlessly attached, with proper texture and scale matching the rest of the box surface.",
      "question": "Are the floral-themed accents on the figurine box proportionally sized and textured in a way that matches the material and style of the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reimagining the cat as a glossy chibi figure inside the box, evaluate the internal representation of the cat within the box. The original cat has distinct features such as blue eyes, dark points on face and ears, and a long tail. The chibi version must retain recognizable traits but in a stylized, exaggerated form. The focus is on whether the chibi figure's shape, size, and placement inside the box conform to physical logic and do not appear floating or misaligned.",
      "question": "Is the chibi cat figure positioned correctly within the box, with its body fully contained and aligned with the interior space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering the chibi cat with sparkling blue glass-like eyes, assess whether the eye texture appears realistic and consistent with the material description. The original cat has vivid blue eyes; the edited version should enhance this feature with a reflective, glassy quality. The evaluation checks for unnatural glares, inconsistent reflections, or overly artificial sparkle effects that might break realism.",
      "question": "Do the eyes of the chibi cat exhibit smooth, uniform glass-like reflection without visible pixelation or irregular highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of displaying a realistic figure beside the box to emphasize natural textures of fur and wood, evaluate the fidelity of materials in the secondary figure. The original image includes a lifelike cat with detailed fur and a wooden windowsill with visible grain. The realistic figure next to the box must replicate these textures accurately. The assessment focuses on whether the fur shows natural directionality and softness, and whether the wood grain matches the original surface.",
      "question": "Does the fur texture of the realistic cat figure beside the box show consistent flow and detail comparable to the original catâ€™s fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
