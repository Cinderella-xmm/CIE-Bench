Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the plush toy pig into a ceramic figurine with a glossy finish, evaluate whether the material transition from knitted yarn to ceramic is visually coherent and free of unnatural textures. The original image shows a textured knit surface with visible stitches; the edited version must maintain structural consistency while replacing this texture with a smooth, reflective ceramic surface without introducing artifacts like inconsistent gloss or abrupt texture changes.
Question: Does the surface of the figurine exhibit a uniform glossy finish consistent with ceramic material, without patches of retained knit texture or uneven sheen?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of changing the color to a vibrant terracotta tone, assess whether the new color accurately reflects a natural terracotta hue and is applied evenly across the entire object. The original image features a neutral beige tone; the edit must avoid color bleeding or non-uniform application that could compromise realism.
Question: Is the terracotta color applied uniformly across the entire body of the figurine, without streaks, discoloration, or mismatched tones in different areas?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding intricate floral engravings on the surface, determine whether the engravings appear physically plausible and integrated into the ceramic form. These details must not distort the underlying shape or appear as floating or disconnected patterns that break the continuity of the surface.
Question: Are the floral engravings clearly defined, proportionally scaled, and seamlessly embedded into the surface of the figurine without causing geometric distortions or overlapping inconsistencies?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of remodeling the eyes to resemble small polished amber stones, evaluate whether the eye replacements maintain realistic proportions, reflectivity, and placement relative to the face. The original black bead eyes are simple; the new amber stones must appear three-dimensional and naturally positioned without misalignment or unnatural shine.
Question: Do the amber-colored eyes have a smooth, polished appearance with appropriate reflection and depth, and are they correctly positioned within the facial structure without appearing displaced or oversized?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the figurine on a simple wooden tabletop for a minimalist presentation, assess whether the base surface appears physically consistent with wood (grain, texture, lighting) and supports the figurine in a stable, natural pose. The hand holding the original toy must no longer be present, so check if the object rests properly on the table without floating or unnatural shadows.
Question: Is the figurine resting flat on a wooden surface with visible wood grain and natural shadowing beneath it, indicating proper physical support and spatial coherence?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
