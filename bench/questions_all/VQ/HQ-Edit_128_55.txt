Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction requires transforming the ornate wooden door into a mystical guardian creature. This involves morphing existing architectural elements—such as geometric patterns, door knobs, and the arch—into biological or fantastical features like feathered wings, eyes, and a celestial crown. The transformation must preserve structural coherence while introducing new forms that do not disrupt the original material logic (wood, metal, stone). Key areas include the door's surface (for runes and texture evolution), the arched top (for crown formation), the vertical rows of iron studs (to become eyes), and the surrounding frame (to become a cloak-like structure). Each transformation must maintain plausible proportions, avoid broken geometry, and retain fine details such as carvings and textures without introducing artifacts like pixelation, unnatural blending, or inconsistent shading.
-Sub requirement 1: The geometric patterns on the door’s surface are to be extended into feathered wings. Evaluate whether these extensions maintain consistent texture, scale, and material continuity with the original wood and carving style, avoiding abrupt transitions or distorted shapes.
-Sub requirement 2: The iron studs along the door’s center are to be transformed into shimmering eyes. Assess whether the new eye features retain spatial alignment with the original stud positions, have natural-looking reflections and iridescence, and do not distort the underlying wooden structure.
-Sub requirement 3: The arched top of the door is to evolve into a celestial crown. Check if the arch’s curvature remains intact and if the added crown elements follow logical geometric progression from the existing shape, without breaking symmetry or introducing floating fragments.
-Sub requirement 4: Etched runes are to be added across the wooden body. Determine if the runes appear integrated into the wood grain, follow natural depth and lighting, and do not override or obscure original carvings.
-Sub requirement 5: The doorframe is to become a regal, cloak-like structure. Evaluate whether the frame’s transition into fabric-like folds maintains structural plausibility, respects original thickness and shadowing, and avoids unnatural warping or volume collapse.
-Sub requirement 6: Overall composition must preserve visual credibility by ensuring all transformed parts cohere in scale, lighting, and material behavior, with no visible seams, ghosting, or loss of fine detail.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of extending geometric patterns into feathered wings, this transformation occurs primarily on the sides of the door where the carved panels meet the frame. The feathers must emerge naturally from the existing wood texture and follow the same light direction and material properties as the original door. Any deviation in scale, edge sharpness, or texture continuity would break realism.
Question: Do the feathered wing extensions on the sides of the door maintain consistent wood grain and carving depth, with smooth transitions from the original panel edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of morphing the iron studs into shimmering eyes, the central vertical row of dark studs is the target area. The transformation must preserve their original spacing and alignment while adding reflective surfaces and organic contours resembling eyes. If the eyes appear misaligned, oversized, or detached from the door’s surface, it would violate structural consistency.
Question: Are the shimmering eyes formed from the iron studs aligned with their original positions and embedded within the wood without floating or overlapping incorrectly?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of evolving the arch into a celestial crown, the upper curved portion of the door is the focus. The crown must extend upward from the arch’s apex in a way that respects its original curvature and does not introduce jagged edges or disconnected segments. Lighting and shadow should remain consistent with the rest of the structure.
Question: Does the celestial crown emerging from the arch maintain continuous curvature and seamless integration with the original arch shape, without broken lines or floating pieces?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding etched runes across the wooden body, the runes must appear carved into the surface, following the same relief depth and lighting as the existing patterns. They should not overlay or obscure original designs but rather blend into them. Inconsistencies in depth or color would indicate poor integration.
Question: Are the etched runes visible across the door’s surface consistent in depth, color, and lighting with the original carvings, and do they not cover or distort existing patterns?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the doorframe into a cloak-like structure, the surrounding stonework and frame must transition into fabric folds. This change must respect the original thickness and shadows of the frame, with folds appearing volumetric and lit consistently. If the cloth appears flat, stretched unnaturally, or disconnected from the wall, it would lack visual credibility.
Question: Does the cloak-like structure around the doorframe exhibit natural fabric folds with consistent lighting and shadow, and does it maintain connection to the original stone frame without gaps or distortions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
