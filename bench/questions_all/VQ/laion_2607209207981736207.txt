Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the scanner into a sleek, futuristic tech gadget packaging with metallic textures and an iridescent color scheme, evaluate whether the material properties of the edited surface (especially the body of the scanner) have been realistically altered to reflect metallic sheen and iridescence without introducing unnatural reflections or texture inconsistencies. The original image shows a matte black and gray plastic casing; any transformation must preserve structural coherence while adding new material qualities.
Question: Does the metallic texture applied to the scanner's body exhibit consistent highlights and reflections that align with the light source direction, avoiding patchy or overly shiny areas?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a holographic display on the box front showing the scanner in action, assess whether the placement and appearance of the hologram are visually plausible—specifically, whether it appears as a transparent overlay with depth cues, soft edges, and realistic distortion effects typical of holograms, rather than a flat or poorly blended image. The original image has a clear front panel where such a display could be positioned.
Question: Is the holographic display integrated into the front panel with translucent edges and layered visual depth, maintaining alignment with the scanner’s shape and not appearing as a simple 2D overlay?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of including grid lines mimicking data flow across the box surface, determine whether these lines follow a logical pattern (e.g., directional flow from input to output), maintain uniform thickness and spacing, and do not disrupt the underlying structure or texture of the packaging. These lines should appear as part of the surface design, not as superimposed artifacts.
Question: Are the grid lines evenly spaced and aligned with the orientation of the device, forming continuous patterns without jagged edges or interruptions that suggest digital artifacting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of integrating tech-themed icons and branding for a modern aesthetic, evaluate whether the added logos and symbols are proportionally sized, stylistically consistent with the futuristic theme, and placed in locations that do not obscure functional elements like buttons or the document feeder. The original image includes existing branding ("Toshiba", "fi-7160") near the top left.
Question: Are the tech-themed icons and branding clearly legible, properly scaled, and positioned in non-intrusive areas such as the lower corners or sides, without overlapping critical components like the control panel or paper path?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility when replacing the scanner with packaging, assess whether the overall proportions of the object remain physically rational—i.e., the box is not disproportionately larger or smaller than the original scanner, and all features (like the paper tray and control panel) are preserved in form but reinterpreted as part of the packaging design. The original image shows a compact desktop scanner with specific dimensions.
Question: Does the transformed packaging retain the same overall dimensions and spatial relationships between components (e.g., paper feed slot, control panel area) as the original scanner, preventing distortion or misalignment of key parts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
