    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a glass display case around the elephant, evaluate whether the transparent material of the case is rendered with natural refraction, reflection, and edge clarity. The glass should not introduce unnatural distortions or visible seams that break the visual coherence of the scene. This affects the overall realism and structural consistency of the composition.",
      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the elephant have clear, smooth edges without visible artifacts, distortions, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using metallic resin for the intricate armor detailing, assess whether the texture and sheen of the armor on the elephant’s body maintain consistent material properties—such as metallic luster, fine embossing, and realistic lighting interaction—without appearing artificially flat or overly shiny. This ensures material authenticity and visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are the metallic resin details on the elephant’s armor consistently textured and reflective, showing no unnatural glossiness or broken patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing miniature silk-gold banners at the corners of the display case, determine if these banners are proportionally scaled, correctly positioned, and exhibit natural fabric folds and color gradients. Their placement must not interfere with the spatial logic of the scene or appear floating without support.",
      "question": "Are the silk-gold banners located at the four corners of the glass case, properly anchored, and displaying natural fabric draping and color variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of creating a backdrop of layered, translucent mountain silhouettes, evaluate whether the background mountains retain depth through proper layering and transparency effects, without abrupt transitions or loss of detail. This affects the perceived atmospheric depth and visual plausibility of the environment.",
      "question": "Do the layered mountain silhouettes in the background show gradual opacity and depth, with no sharp edges or inconsistent transparency levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of sculpting small bonsai-like trees at the foreground edges, assess whether these trees are proportionally sized relative to the elephant and display natural foliage structure, branching patterns, and grounding in the terrain. Their presence should enhance realism without appearing pasted or disconnected from the environment.",
      "question": "Are the bonsai-like trees at the foreground edges realistically integrated into the rocky surface, with natural leaf textures and root placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
