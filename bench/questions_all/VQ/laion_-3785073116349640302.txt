Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting Ultraman and the creature into playful 3D chibi figures made of smooth, glossy material, evaluate whether the transformation maintains structural coherence and natural appearance. The original image shows Ultraman in a dynamic pose with detailed musculature and armor, while the creature has sharp, organic features. Converting these into chibi forms requires proportional scaling and material consistency. This question checks if the new forms retain recognizable shapes without geometric distortion or unnatural proportions.
Question: Are the chibi versions of Ultraman and the creature proportionally scaled with rounded, simplified features that maintain their identifiable characteristics without distorted limbs or facial structures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of rendering the characters as glossy, smooth 3D figures, assess whether the material properties are consistently applied and free from artifacts such as texture mismatch or unnatural sheen. The original image uses matte and metallic textures; replacing them with a uniform glossy finish may introduce visual inconsistencies if not handled properly.
Question: Do the surfaces of the chibi figures exhibit a consistent, smooth, glossy finish without visible texture breaks, uneven highlights, or unnatural reflections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of surrounding the characters with swirling mist of tiny glittering dust particles, evaluate whether the particle effects appear naturally distributed and integrated into the scene. In the original image, the background is filled with organic patterns and smoke-like clouds; adding glittering particles must not clash with existing elements or appear as static overlays.
Question: Are the glittering dust particles evenly distributed in the air around the chibi figures, forming a soft, swirling motion that blends naturally with the background mist without clumping or artificial trails?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the scene inside a snow globe with an etched cosmic pattern on the outer surface, assess whether the globe structure is visually coherent and physically plausible. The original image has no enclosure; introducing a transparent spherical boundary requires accurate depth cues and reflection behavior to avoid breaking immersion.
Question: Is the outer globe clearly defined with a transparent spherical shape that contains all internal elements, and do the etched cosmic patterns on its surface appear correctly aligned and non-distorted across the curvature?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of a rugged terrain base with metallic debris, evaluate whether the base maintains structural integrity and visual credibility. The original image includes a wrecked vehicle and rocky ground; transforming this into a stylized base must preserve recognizable debris while contrasting with the whimsical chibi figures.
Question: Does the base feature detailed metallic debris and rugged terrain that support the scene's scale and contrast with the chibi figures, without floating or misplaced objects or inconsistent lighting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
