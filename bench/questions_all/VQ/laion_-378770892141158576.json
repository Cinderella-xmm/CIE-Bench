      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the person’s tank top into a long flowing robe with floral patterns, this involves replacing clothing elements and altering fabric texture and drape. The editing position is the torso and lower body of the person standing in front of the lake. This change must maintain natural fabric flow, realistic folds, and consistent material properties without introducing unnatural textures or distortions. The floral pattern should integrate seamlessly with the cartoon style while preserving visual coherence.",
      "question": "Does the long flowing robe have natural fabric draping and folds that follow the contours of the body without unnatural stretching or clumping?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the posture from standing to seated and reading, this involves modifying the person's pose and limbs. The editing position is the full body of the individual, particularly the legs, arms, and head orientation. The seated posture must conform to anatomical proportions and physical plausibility, with proper alignment of joints and natural limb positioning. The act of reading implies the presence of a book or object held in hands, which must be realistically proportioned and positioned.",
      "question": "Are the limbs and joints of the seated figure anatomically correct, with no distorted angles or disproportionate lengths?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering the entire image in a cartoon style with enlarged eyes, this involves stylization of facial features, particularly the eyes. The editing position is the face of the person, focusing on eye size, shape, and surrounding facial structure. Enlarged eyes must remain proportionally balanced with the rest of the face and not cause distortion of adjacent features such as eyebrows or nose. The cartoon style should not compromise structural integrity or introduce unnatural outlines or color bleeding.",
      "question": "Are the eyes significantly larger than normal but still proportionally integrated into the face without distorting surrounding facial features?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using watercolor for soft landscape transitions, this involves altering the rendering style of the background elements—specifically the mountains, lake, sky, and vegetation. The editing position includes the entire landscape behind the person. Watercolor effects should create smooth gradients and soft edges between colors without breaking geometric shapes or introducing pixelation or unnatural blending artifacts. The transition between sky, mountains, and lake should remain visually coherent.",
      "question": "Do the mountain and lake reflections exhibit soft, blended watercolor transitions without sharp edges or artificial-looking brush strokes?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the image on textured cream card stock with lilac-edged borders, this involves adding frame elements around the artwork. The editing position is the outer border of the image. The texture of the card stock must appear consistent and realistic, with subtle surface details that do not interfere with the main content. The lilac border should be evenly applied without overlapping or cutting into the image content, maintaining visual balance and structural consistency.",
      "question": "Is the lilac-edged border uniformly applied around the image without overlapping or obscuring any part of the scene?",
