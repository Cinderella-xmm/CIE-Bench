      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the basketball player into a stylized cartoon form with exaggerated movements and dynamic muscles, evaluate whether the muscle definition and body proportions in the edited image remain structurally coherent and physically plausible. The original image shows a realistic human figure with natural musculature; exaggeration must not lead to distorted anatomy such as unnaturally elongated limbs or misplaced joints.",
      "question": "Do the muscles and body proportions of the basketball player appear exaggerated but still maintain anatomical plausibility without unnatural bulges or broken geometry?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adjusting colors to bold neons reflecting the graffiti backdrop, assess whether the color palette applied to the player’s uniform, skin, or accessories aligns with the vibrant graffiti style while preserving material authenticity (e.g., fabric texture, skin tone). The original image has realistic colors; neon tones should be vivid but not cause unnatural material shifts or loss of detail.",
      "question": "Are the colors applied to the player's clothing and skin consistent with the graffiti theme and do they retain visible texture and material properties without appearing flat or artificially oversaturated?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of depicting the player in a stylized cartoon form, evaluate whether the hand holding the basketball maintains ergonomic structure—specifically, whether the number of fingers is five, their shape is natural, and the positioning conforms to typical gripping behavior. The original image shows a correctly formed hand; any stylization must preserve this.",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the basketball have exactly five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and does it grip the ball in a physically credible manner?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of including a blank graffiti-style text area on the side for custom messages, evaluate whether the added text area integrates seamlessly into the composition. It must be positioned logically within the frame, stylistically consistent with surrounding graffiti, and not disrupt spatial balance or depth perception.",
      "question": "Is the blank graffiti-style text area clearly visible, stylistically consistent with the background graffiti, and placed in a way that does not distort the scene or obscure key elements?",

The original image has realistic lighting; stylized editing should not introduce inconsistent shadows, floating elements, or texture mismatches.",
      "question": "Are the lighting, shadows, and surface textures of the player, basketball, and court consistent with each other and free from artifacts such as mismatched highlights or ghosting?",
