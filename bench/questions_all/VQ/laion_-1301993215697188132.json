      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the human face into an owlâ€™s head with a beak and feathers, evaluate whether the facial structure has been replaced with avian features in a way that preserves anatomical plausibility and avoids unnatural distortions such as misshapen eyes, misplaced beak, or inconsistent feather patterns. The original face has defined features like eyebrows, nose, and lips; these must be replaced with owl-specific traits while maintaining alignment with the existing head shape and lighting.",
      "question": "Does the owl's head retain proper geometric proportions with a beak that aligns with the jawline and eyes that are symmetrically placed and shaped like those of a real owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adapting the blue jacket into a feathered cloak, assess whether the texture of the clothing has been transformed into realistic feathers without losing the original blue color tone or introducing artificial patterns. The original jacket has a herringbone weave; this should transition into layered feathers that follow natural growth direction and lighting response.",
      "question": "Are the feathers on the cloak consistent in direction, shading, and density, and do they blend naturally with the original blue color without visible seams or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding small glasses perched on the beak, evaluate whether the glasses are correctly scaled, positioned, and attached to the beak in a physically stable manner. The original image shows no glasses, so their addition must not appear floating or misaligned due to incorrect perspective or shadowing.",
      "question": "Are the glasses resting securely on the beak with correct reflection and shadow placement, and do they match the size and style of typical reading glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the raised human hand into expressive wing movement, assess whether the hand has been replaced with wing-like structures that resemble bird wings in form and motion. The original hand has five fingers; the edited version should show fewer digits or fused segments resembling wing bones and feathers, avoiding anatomical impossibilities.",
      "question": "Is the hand replaced with a wing-like structure that has logical joint placement and feather coverage, and does it lack extra fingers or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding speech bubbles near the mouth area, evaluate whether the bubbles are clearly visible, properly sized, and positioned close to the mouth without overlapping critical features like the beak or glasses. They should contain readable text using high-contrast colors and not disrupt the composition.",
      "question": "Are the speech bubbles placed adjacent to the beak, contain legible text with contrasting colors, and do not overlap with other elements like the microphone or feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating subtle branch elements into the background, assess whether the branches are rendered with natural texture, appropriate thickness, and realistic lighting. They should not intersect with the subject unnaturally or appear cut-and-pasted without depth integration.",
      "question": "Do the branches extend from the background with natural tapering and bark texture, and are they positioned behind the subject without casting incorrect shadows or appearing flat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
