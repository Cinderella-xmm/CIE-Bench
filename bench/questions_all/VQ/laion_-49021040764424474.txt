Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the pickup truck into a LEGO model using orange, black, and silver bricks, evaluate whether the body color and material texture of the truck have been converted to resemble LEGO bricks. The original image shows a smooth metallic orange surface with reflections and fine details. The editing requires replacing this with blocky, matte LEGO-like surfaces. This transformation affects overall realism and natural appearance significantly. The question checks if the brick texture is consistent across the body panels (especially visible on doors, hood, and fenders) without unnatural blending or missing textures.
Question: Are the orange, black, and silver sections of the truck's body composed of clearly defined LEGO brick patterns with uniform size and alignment, avoiding blurred or inconsistent textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of redesigning the wheels with circular gray pieces, assess whether the wheel design has been replaced with LEGO-style circular components. The original wheels are multi-spoke alloy rims with realistic tire tread and sidewall details. The edited version should show simplified, modular gray LEGO wheel pieces that maintain proper circular shape and proportional sizing relative to the truck bed and chassis. This evaluates structural consistency and visual credibility in the wheel replacement.
Question: Do the wheels consist of circular gray LEGO-style pieces with correct proportions and no deformation, maintaining a solid geometric structure without jagged edges or distorted shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of recreating the truck bed with smooth black tiles, examine the bed area in the original image, which features a textured metal liner and tailgate. The editing must replace this with flat, smooth black LEGO tiles. This change impacts material authenticity and structural coherence—any mismatch in tile alignment, gaps, or unnatural transitions between tiles would compromise perceived quality. The question focuses on the physical plausibility of the tile layout and absence of artifacts.
Question: Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth, flat black LEGO tiles arranged in a regular grid pattern without gaps, overlaps, or misaligned edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of positioning the LEGO truck atop a simple white shelf, evaluate the placement of the vehicle in the scene. The original image shows the truck on gravel ground surrounded by stacked wood and trees. The edited version must place the entire LEGO model on a clean, minimal white shelf, which changes the environment and perspective. This test checks for visual credibility in object placement—whether the truck sits flush on the shelf, maintains proper scale, and does not appear floating or clipped unnaturally.
Question: Is the LEGO truck positioned securely on a flat white shelf with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does the shelf extend appropriately beneath the full width of the truck?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility during the style conversion, assess whether the transition from real-world materials to LEGO elements preserves logical proportions and spatial relationships. For example, the tailgate, side steps, and rear bumper must retain their relative positions and sizes while being rebuilt in LEGO form. Any disproportionate scaling, incorrect attachment points, or broken geometry (e.g., misaligned hinges or missing parts) would indicate distortion.
Question: Are all major structural components such as the tailgate, side steps, and bumpers correctly reconstructed in LEGO form with accurate proportions and proper alignment to the rest of the truck body?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
