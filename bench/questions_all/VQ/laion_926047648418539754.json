      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the dress into a flapper-style, fringed piece with geometric patterns, evaluate whether the transformation maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original dress is a form-fitting black mini dress with puffed sleeves made of faux fur. The editing involves replacing this with a flapper-style design featuring fringe and geometric patterns. This change affects the shape, texture, and material of the garment. It is essential to assess whether the new pattern aligns with the body’s silhouette, whether the fringe appears physically plausible in length and density, and whether the geometric shapes are proportionally consistent with 1920s Art Deco aesthetics.",
      "question": "Does the modified dress retain a coherent silhouette that follows the body's natural contours without unnatural stretching or distortion?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the bag into a beaded clutch fitting the era, evaluate the material and structure of the new bag. The original bag is a leopard-print pouch with silver chain straps and pearl-like fringe. The edited version should be a beaded clutch typical of the 1920s, likely featuring intricate beadwork and a rigid or semi-rigid structure. The question focuses on whether the replacement bag maintains realistic material properties (such as bead texture and reflection), correct proportions relative to the hand, and proper attachment to the chain strap.",
      "question": "Is the beaded clutch positioned naturally in the hands, with visible beadwork that appears uniform and structurally sound without gaps or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reimagining the chunky heels as elegant T-strap shoes, assess the footwear transformation. The original shoes are black platform heels with ankle straps and a thick heel. The new style must reflect 1920s elegance—T-strap design, thinner heel, possibly lower height, and refined materials. The evaluation includes checking whether the shoe shape conforms to anatomical foot structure, whether the T-strap crosses correctly over the instep, and whether the heel thickness and angle appear physically rational.",
      "question": "Do the T-strap shoes maintain correct anatomical alignment with the feet, with no overlapping straps or distorted toe boxes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of stylizing the background with bold, linear Deco designs in gold and black, evaluate the integration of the new background. The original background is plain white. The edited version introduces geometric patterns typical of Art Deco—symmetrical lines, angles, and gold accents. The key concern is whether these elements are seamlessly integrated without disrupting depth perception or creating visual noise, and whether they remain consistent in scale and orientation across the image.",
      "question": "Are the linear Deco patterns evenly distributed and aligned with the subject’s posture, avoiding misalignment or perspective errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring overall authenticity and natural appearance during style conversion, assess the consistency of materials and textures across all modified elements. For instance, the transition from faux fur sleeves to a flapper dress may involve changing texture from soft plush to shiny fabric with fringe. The evaluation checks whether such transitions are smooth, without abrupt texture shifts, pixelation, or artificial blending artifacts, especially at edges where different materials meet.",
      "question": "Are the material transitions between the dress, sleeves, and accessories seamless, with no visible seams, jagged edges, or unnatural texture blending?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
