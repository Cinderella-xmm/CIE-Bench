      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the statue into a 3D clay model, evaluate whether the material texture and surface appearance of the entire statue have been altered to resemble clay while maintaining structural coherence. The original image shows a stone-like texture with smooth, polished surfaces; changing it to clay involves modifying surface roughness, color tone, and reflectivity. This transformation must preserve the anatomical details (e.g., musculature, facial features) without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details such as the snake’s scales or beads.",
      "question": "Does the statue exhibit a consistent clay-like texture across all body parts, including the face, limbs, and torso, without visible patches of mismatched material or unnatural graininess?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of encasing the statue in a large circular glass dome, assess whether the dome is seamlessly integrated into the scene. The dome must be transparent with realistic reflections and refractions, and its placement should not distort the proportions of the statue or obscure key features like the trident or drum. The dome’s curvature must follow physical laws of geometry and light interaction.",
      "question": "Is the glass dome fully transparent with no visible distortion of the statue's shape or features behind it, and does it display natural reflections and refractions consistent with real glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding ornate patterns to the glass dome featuring lotus and wave motifs, evaluate whether these designs are clearly rendered and proportionally accurate. These patterns must be applied without disrupting the transparency of the glass or causing visual artifacts such as blurring, misalignment, or inconsistent line thickness. Their placement should enhance realism rather than appear digitally pasted.",
      "question": "Are the lotus and wave patterns on the glass dome evenly spaced, clearly defined, and integrated smoothly into the surface without overlapping or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of spotlighting the trident, snake, and drum to emphasize their golden hues, assess whether the lighting effect enhances these elements naturally. The spotlight should create localized brightness and contrast that accentuate gold tones without causing overexposure, halos, or unnatural glows. The lighting must align with the direction of ambient light in the scene.",
      "question": "Do the trident, snake, and drum exhibit enhanced golden highlights under the spotlight without visible halo effects, color bleeding, or overexposed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of accentuating muscular contours with intricate shadowing, evaluate whether the shadows on the statue’s arms, chest, and legs follow anatomical form and lighting logic. Shadows must be soft and gradual where appropriate, avoiding harsh lines or incorrect depth cues that would suggest deformation or false volume.",
      "question": "Are the muscle contours on the statue’s arms, chest, and legs accurately shaded with smooth gradients that follow the underlying anatomy and directional light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing small incense holders around the base for aromatic ambiance, assess whether these objects are proportionally correct and positioned realistically. They must be sized appropriately relative to the statue and pedestal, placed at ground level, and feature natural materials like ceramic or metal without floating or clipping issues.",
      "question": "Are the incense holders positioned at ground level around the base of the pedestal, correctly scaled, and free from floating or clipping against other structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
