Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the teapot into a miniature scene within a glass dome, evaluate whether the addition of the glass dome introduces unnatural textures or reflections that compromise visual credibility. The original image shows a highly reflective metallic surface with clear lighting and shadows; any added transparent material must maintain consistent light interaction and avoid artificial gloss or distortion.
Question: Does the glass dome have natural transparency and refraction effects that match the lighting direction and shadow patterns from the window, without visible artifacts such as uneven edges or unrealistic glare?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the teapot on a vintage wooden base with a soft velvet lining, assess whether the new base maintains structural coherence with the existing wooden table surface. The original image features a rustic wooden plank table with visible grain and texture; the added base should not contradict this material continuity or introduce mismatched wood tones or unnatural padding textures.
Question: Is the vintage wooden base visually consistent in color, texture, and grain pattern with the surrounding wooden table, and does the velvet lining appear soft and layered without pixelation or unnatural sheen?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding tiny flowering plants and ferns emerging from the spout and lid, evaluate whether these elements are proportionally accurate and physically plausible. The original teapot has a defined spout and lid geometry; vegetation growing from these areas must follow natural growth logic and not distort the underlying structure or create floating or disconnected plant parts.
Question: Do the flowering plants and ferns emerging from the spout and lid grow in a way that follows natural botanical form and maintains contact with the teapot's surface without floating or breaking geometric continuity?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding delicate butterflies hovering around floral engravings, assess whether their placement and rendering maintain realism and spatial consistency. The original teapot features intricate engraved flowers; butterflies should be positioned at realistic distances and angles relative to the surface, with appropriate wing detail and shadow casting.
Question: Are the butterflies positioned at plausible flight heights and angles near the floral engravings, with visible wings and body details that match the scale and lighting of the scene, and do they cast subtle shadows on the teapot surface?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using subtle earth-toned hues for a sophisticated look, evaluate whether the color palette across all added elements (dome, base, plants, butterflies) harmonizes with the original imageâ€™s monochromatic silver and warm wood tones. Any deviation into overly saturated or discordant colors would disrupt the overall authenticity and visual cohesion.
Question: Are all newly added elements rendered in muted earth tones that blend seamlessly with the original silver teapot and wooden background, avoiding bright or jarring color contrasts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
