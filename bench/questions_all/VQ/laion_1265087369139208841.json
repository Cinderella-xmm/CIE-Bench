      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a transparent crystal orb encircling the castle, this question evaluates whether the orb’s edges are smooth and continuous, and whether it distorts the underlying architecture through unnatural warping or refraction. The orb must not interfere with the castle’s proportions or create floating fragments.",
      "question": "Does the crystal orb surrounding the castle have clean, unbroken edges without visible distortion or bending of the castle’s structure inside it?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding ethereal clouds around the castle, this question checks whether the clouds are positioned above the structure without intersecting walls or towers, and whether they have soft edges consistent with atmospheric rendering. Clouds must not appear clipped or artificially layered.",
      "question": "Are the clouds positioned above the castle without overlapping or clipping through any architectural elements, and do they have soft, natural-looking edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding vines climbing the castle walls, this question assesses whether the vines grow upward from the base of the walls, follow the curvature of the stonework, and do not abruptly appear mid-height or disrupt the texture of the stones.",
      "question": "Do the vines climb the castle walls from the bottom upward, following the wall contours without breaking the stone texture or appearing to float in mid-air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding gem-like flowers in the garden areas, this question evaluates whether the flowers are integrated into the existing flowerbeds, maintain consistent scale with surrounding plants, and do not display unnatural shine or repetitive patterns that suggest digital artifacting.",
      "question": "Are the gem-like flowers placed within the garden beds at a natural scale, with no excessive glare or repeating textures that indicate artificial rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing a tiny dragon on the central tower, this question checks whether the dragon is proportionally small, rests on a valid surface (like a ledge), and casts a shadow consistent with the lighting direction of the scene.",
      "question": "Is the dragon positioned on a stable part of the central tower, proportionally small compared to the structure, and casting a shadow aligned with the ambient light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a gold base with medieval motifs beneath the castle, this question evaluates whether the base lies flat against the ground plane, extends uniformly under the structure, and displays detailed engravings without pixelation or misalignment.",
      "question": "Does the gold base lie flush with the ground, extend evenly under the castle, and show consistent engraved patterns without jagged edges or texture errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency across all edits, this question checks whether any edited element (e.g., orb, dragon, vines) causes geometric breaks, floating parts, or lighting contradictions that compromise visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are all added elements (orb, clouds, vines, dragon, flowers, base) structurally coherent with the original castle, showing no broken lines, floating components, or conflicting lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
