Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the sneaker into a modern energy drink can design while preserving the navy blue mesh pattern from the shoe’s upper, evaluate whether the texture transfer maintains visual coherence and natural appearance. The original shoe's mesh is located on the toe box, side panels, and ankle area—these areas must be accurately mapped onto the cylindrical surface of the can without distortion or unnatural stretching. The question checks if the material transition preserves realistic texture and avoids artifacts such as pixelation or irregular mesh patterns.
Question: Does the navy blue mesh pattern on the can maintain consistent texture density and alignment without visible warping or unnatural stretching?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding the brand logo (the circular "C" with red and blue elements) to the front of the can, assess whether the logo placement respects scale, proportion, and clarity. The logo in the original image is positioned on the lateral heel area of the shoe. When transferred to the can, it must remain legible and properly scaled relative to the can’s dimensions. This evaluates structural consistency and visual credibility in branding placement.
Question: Is the brand logo clearly visible on the front of the can, correctly proportioned, and free from blurring or deformation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of incorporating the bold laces as embossed texture around the can, evaluate whether the 3D-like lace texture appears physically plausible. The original laces are dark blue with a woven structure and run across the midfoot. When translated into embossed ridges on the can, they should follow a logical circumferential path and maintain consistent depth and spacing. This checks for artificiality or unnatural geometry in the embossing.
Question: Are the embossed lace textures evenly spaced and aligned around the can, without jagged edges or inconsistent depth that suggests digital artifacting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using the sole stripes (white with navy blue stripes) as a dynamic pattern on the bottom half of the can, assess whether the stripe pattern transitions naturally from the flat sole to the curved surface. The original three stripes are on the white midsole, running diagonally. On the can, they should wrap smoothly around the lower portion without breaking or distorting. This evaluates geometric continuity and physical plausibility.
Question: Do the sole stripes wrap seamlessly around the lower half of the can, maintaining their shape and spacing without tearing or misalignment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of introducing the sporty name "Kickstart" in red lettering atop the white area of the can, evaluate whether the text placement and style integrate naturally with the design. The white area corresponds to the top section of the shoe’s midsole. The text must be legible, properly sized, and stylistically consistent with the sporty aesthetic. This checks for font clarity, color contrast, and spatial logic.
Question: Is the red "Kickstart" text clearly readable, properly centered on the white area, and free from shadowing or blurring that would suggest poor rendering?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
