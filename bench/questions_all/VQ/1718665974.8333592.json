      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the figure’s attire into intricate brass gears and leather armor, evaluate whether the newly added mechanical elements (such as gears and armor plates) maintain structural coherence with the original clothing's form and proportions. The editing position includes the chest, shoulders, and arms where the original red cloak and blue garment are present. Focus on whether the integration of brass components preserves natural material textures and avoids geometric distortions or unnatural overlaps.",
      "question": "Do the brass gears and leather armor pieces on the character’s torso and limbs have consistent shapes, realistic metallic textures, and proper alignment without visible gaps or misaligned edges?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating clockwork wings with mechanical detail, assess the visual plausibility of the wing structure. The original image features translucent insect-like wings extending from behind the shoulders. The edited version must replace these with mechanical wings composed of gears, metal frames, and articulated joints. Evaluate whether the new wings retain symmetry, proper proportion relative to the body, and avoid unnatural bending or missing structural elements.",
      "question": "Are the clockwork wings symmetrically positioned and structurally coherent, with visible mechanical joints and gear patterns that follow logical engineering principles and do not exhibit warped or broken geometry?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a clock face within the glowing orb at the center of the character’s chest, evaluate the integration of this new element into the existing magical symbol. The original image shows a radiant golden orb connected by organic-looking tendrils. The addition of a clock face must be visually embedded without disrupting the glow or altering the surrounding tendrils unnaturally. Check for clarity in clock markings, proper scaling, and consistency in light emission.",
      "question": "Is the clock face integrated into the glowing orb clearly visible, properly scaled, and emitting light consistently with the surrounding glow, without distorting the shape or texture of the orb or tendrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the background with a vast cityscape of brass towers and airships under a sepia tone, evaluate whether the new background maintains visual depth, architectural coherence, and stylistic harmony with the steampunk theme. The original background is a swirling, abstract tunnel-like structure. The new scene must transition seamlessly without abrupt edges or mismatched lighting. Assess whether the brass structures appear solid, proportionally accurate, and appropriately lit under the sepia filter.",
      "question": "Does the background cityscape feature detailed brass towers and airships arranged in a spatially plausible layout, with consistent lighting and shadowing under a sepia tone, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying a sepia tone across the entire image to achieve a vintage aesthetic, evaluate whether the color grading affects all elements uniformly without introducing unnatural color shifts or loss of detail. The original image has vibrant colors, especially in the red cloak and glowing orb. The sepia tone should be applied evenly while preserving key features like the metallic sheen of brass and the visibility of fine textures such as gear teeth and fabric folds.",
      "question": "Is the sepia tone applied consistently across the entire image, maintaining visible details in the character’s clothing, mechanical elements, and background without causing fading, discoloration, or loss of contrast in critical areas?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
