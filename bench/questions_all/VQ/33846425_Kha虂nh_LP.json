The focus is on the lower part of the dress where the lace detail is most prominent.",
      "question": "Does the enlarged skirt maintain consistent lace texture and pattern without visible warping, tiling, or unnatural stretching?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enhancing lace detailing on the dress, this question checks whether the added details integrate seamlessly with the original fabric and do not introduce artificial or overly dense patterns that break the natural appearance of the material. The area of interest is the mid-to-lower section of the dress where intricate lace work is present.",
      "question": "Are the enhanced lace details consistent in thickness, spacing, and opacity with the original lace, and do they lack abrupt edges or synthetic-looking overlays?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the car into a vintage camper van by adding structural elements, this question evaluates whether the added components (such as side panels or windows) align with the vehicle’s original proportions and do not distort its shape or violate spatial logic. The focus is on the sides and roofline of the yellow car.",
      "question": "Do the added structural elements of the camper van conversion (e.g., side panels, windows) follow the car’s existing geometry and maintain consistent scale and perspective?",

The focus is on the hood and sides of the car where floral designs would be visible.",
      "question": "Are the floral paintings applied smoothly across the car’s curved surfaces without flatness, misalignment, or unnatural shadowing?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the background with textured kraft paper and adding nautical-themed borders, this question checks whether the new background does not interfere with the clarity of the foreground elements and whether the border design remains within the frame without overlapping critical areas. The focus is on the outer edges of the image and the transition between the subject and background.",
      "question": "Is the kraft paper texture uniformly applied across the background without obscuring the subject or creating visible seams, and are the nautical borders contained within the image boundaries without cutting into the woman or car?",

It verifies that the number of fingers is correct, the hand posture is natural, and the footwear remains proportionate.",
