Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility when transforming the worker into a chibi-style 3D cartoon character, we need to evaluate if the character retains its core elements (yellow hard hat, fluorescent yellow shirt, and orange reflective vest) while being integrated into a low-poly construction scene. The horse in the original image needs to be replaced with this new chibi character, focusing on maintaining naturalness and avoiding distortions.
Question: Does the chibi-style 3D cartoon character stand naturally at the center of the image without visible distortions in its proportions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of retaining the iconic yellow hard hat, fluorescent yellow shirt, and orange reflective vest, we need to confirm if these colors and materials appear natural within the new 3D environment. The background of the edited image should not contain any natural elements like trees or water from the original image.
Question: Are the colors and materials of the chibi character's hard hat, shirt, and vest consistent with the original image’s description and appear natural in the 3D environment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q3: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement to maintain structural coherence and avoid unnatural textures or artifacts, we need to assess if the transition between the chibi character and the low-poly construction scene is seamless. The original image features a horse grazing on grass, which should not appear in the final edited image.
Question: Does the transition between the chibi character and the low-poly construction scene lack noticeable artifacts and unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q4: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the sub requirement of visual plausibility, the background should feature a simplified light gray plane with a small crane model. We need to ensure that the background does not retain elements from the original beach scenery, such as the ocean, sky, or distant house.
Question: Is the background in the edited image a simplified light gray plane with a small crane model, and is it devoid of elements from the original beach scenery?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q5: 
Thinking process: Concerning the sub requirement of maintaining the composition ratio 1:1 and ensuring physical rationality, the chibi character must fit proportionately within the frame of the image, without unnecessary empty spaces or excessive cropping.
Question: Does the edited image maintain a 1:1 composition ratio with the chibi character properly centered and proportionate within the frame?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
