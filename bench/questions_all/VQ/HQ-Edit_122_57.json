      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the ceramic vase with a crystal version that maintains shape and proportions, evaluate whether the transformed vase retains the original silhouette, including the curved body, flared neck, and scrolled handles, without warping or misalignment. The crystal surface should have visible facets that follow the contours logically, and the material must appear transparent with no opaque patches or unnatural texture.",
      "question": "Does the crystal vase maintain the original shape and proportions of the ceramic vase, with clear faceted surfaces that follow the curvature without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing painted panels with etched abstract floral patterns, assess whether the new patterns are integrated into the crystal surface with consistent line quality and depth, resembling real crystal engraving. The patterns should not appear as floating overlays or pixelated lines.",
      "question": "Are the abstract floral patterns on the crystal vase etched into the surface with uniform depth and clarity, without appearing superimposed or blurred?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting flowers into pastel-colored crystal blossoms, examine whether each flower retains its botanical form (e.g., daisy petals, poppy shape) but appears translucent with internal refraction and soft pastel tones. The stems and leaves should also be rendered in crystal with appropriate translucency and fine detail.",
      "question": "Do the crystal flowers retain the recognizable shapes of the original blooms and display internal refraction and pastel coloration without appearing solid or opaque?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a minimalist mirrored pedestal, check whether the pedestal is flat, clean, and reflective, and whether it supports the vase without visible gaps or instability. The reflection must accurately mirror the vase and flowers with proper symmetry and lighting consistency.",
      "question": "Is the mirrored pedestal flat and reflective, showing a clear, undistorted reflection of the crystal vase and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adjusting lighting for crystal behavior, verify whether the lighting includes soft highlights, internal glow, and chromatic dispersion typical of crystal, particularly around edges and facets. Shadows should be softer and more diffused due to transparency, and there should be no harsh or unrealistic glows.",
      "question": "Does the lighting show realistic refraction and internal glow in the crystal elements, with soft highlights and no unnatural bright spots or flat shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
