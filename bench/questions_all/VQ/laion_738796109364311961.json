      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"exaggerated, dynamic pose with enlarged muscles\", evaluate whether the muscle structure of the player in red (player #24) has been altered to appear unnaturally large or distorted, particularly in the arms, shoulders, and legs. This involves checking for geometric inconsistencies such as bulging limbs that violate human anatomy or disproportionate mass distribution.",
      "question": "Are the muscle proportions of the player in red (player #24) exaggerated but still anatomically plausible without visible distortion or unnatural bulging?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"vibrant uniform colors\", assess whether the color saturation of the red uniform (player #24) and white uniform (player #89) has been enhanced beyond natural limits, resulting in overly bright or artificial hues that lack realistic lighting interaction or texture consistency.",
      "question": "Do the uniform colors of both players retain natural color gradients and material textures despite increased vibrancy, without appearing oversaturated or flat?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"emphasize the team's logo on his helmet and jersey\", verify whether the logos on the helmets and jerseys (especially the \"W\" on the red helmet and \"Cal\" insignia on the white jersey) are clearly visible, proportionally scaled, and correctly positioned without being stretched, duplicated, or misaligned due to editing.",
      "question": "Are the team logos on both players' helmets and jerseys accurately rendered and properly aligned without deformation or pixelation?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"stylized background of a roaring crowd and football field\", evaluate whether the background elements (crowd, field lines, stadium lights) have been modified to appear cartoonish or stylized while maintaining visual coherence—checking for unnatural blurring, inconsistent depth, or abrupt transitions between foreground and background.",
      "question": "Is the background behind the players stylistically enhanced but still coherent with the foreground, without sudden distortions or loss of detail in the crowd or field markings?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"dynamic pose with exaggerated motion\", examine the positioning of limbs and body parts—particularly the arm extension of player #89 and the running posture of player #24—to determine if they follow physical plausibility, including joint angles, limb overlap, and balance during movement.",
      "question": "Do the limbs and body postures of both players maintain structural consistency with real-world biomechanics, even with exaggerated motion, without broken joints or floating limbs?",

      "question": "Is the matte black collector's box with transparent lid visually consistent in material, lighting, and perspective, and does it surround the cards without introducing edge artifacts or lighting mismatches?",
