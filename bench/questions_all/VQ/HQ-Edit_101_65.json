      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the red sari into a regal tapestry gown with intricate gold embroidery resembling elven runes, this involves replacing the fabric pattern and texture of the sari. The original sari has a defined red base with golden floral patterns and a structured border. The edited version must maintain consistent fabric flow, drape, and material coherence across the entire garment, especially at the shoulder, chest, and waist areas where folds and shadows occur. The new design must not introduce unnatural textures, broken patterns, or geometric distortions in the embroidery.",
      "question": "Does the transformed tapestry gown maintain continuous and coherent fabric folds and draping without visible seams or distorted geometry?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing accessories to ornate platinum jewelry with shimmering emeralds, the original image features gold-colored earrings, necklace, and bangles with red accents. The editing targets these specific elements—earrings, necklace, and wristwear. The new materials (platinum and emerald) must reflect appropriate metallic sheen and gemstone clarity. The shape and proportion of each piece must align with human anatomy and typical jewelry design, avoiding exaggerated proportions or unnatural reflections.",
      "question": "Are the platinum jewelry pieces (necklace, earrings, bangles) proportionally accurate and free from unnatural glares, misshapen forms, or inconsistent material textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of altering the background to a dreamy starry night with luminescent flowers and ethereal lanterns, the original background includes warm-toned hanging lights, marigold garlands, and vertical light strips. The new background must replace these while preserving depth and spatial logic. The placement of stars, glowing flowers, and floating lanterns should not violate perspective or occlusion rules. The lighting must remain consistent with the subject’s illumination, avoiding abrupt transitions or mismatched shadows.",
      "question": "Do the newly added elements in the background (stars, luminous flowers, lanterns) follow consistent lighting direction and depth cues without creating visual inconsistencies or floating objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of retaining the dignified posture of the subject, the original image shows the woman with hands gently clasped, fingers aligned naturally, and arms positioned symmetrically. The editing must preserve anatomical correctness—particularly in hand positioning and finger count. Any distortion in the number of fingers, unnatural joint angles, or missing skin textures would compromise structural consistency and visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are both hands correctly formed with five fingers each, natural joint alignment, and no overlapping or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enriching the mystical atmosphere through ethereal elements, the transformation must ensure that all new elements—such as glowing flowers and lanterns—integrate seamlessly with the existing composition. The color palette should transition smoothly from the warm tones of the original to cooler, magical hues without introducing chromatic aberrations or pixelated edges. Material properties like glow and translucency must appear physically plausible.",
      "question": "Do the luminous flowers and ethereal lanterns exhibit smooth gradients and soft glows without jagged edges or artificial halos?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
