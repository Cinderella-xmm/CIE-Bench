    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Considering the sub requirement of ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility while combining different views of the refrigerator, we need to verify if the proportions between connected parts like doors and handles maintain physical rationality. This ensures the absence of unnatural geometric distortions.",
      "question": "Do the refrigerator doors and handles appear proportionally correct and geometrically consistent with typical refrigerator designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of avoiding unnatural textures and maintaining material accuracy during the combination of multiple views, it's important to confirm that surfaces retain their metallic texture and reflectivity properly without introducing artifacts.",
      "question": "Are the metallic surfaces of the refrigerator free from unnatural textures, maintaining a consistent and authentic finish throughout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "To evaluate the overall realism and natural appearance resulting from combining different views, the lighting conditions across the refrigerators should remain consistent. Any discrepancies might suggest artificial merging issues.",
      "question": "Does the lighting appear uniform across both refrigerators, without noticeable shadows or highlights that disrupt the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Concerning the maintained style and visual plausibility, the integration of the refrigerators into the surrounding kitchen environment requires checking if borders or edges show signs of poor editing, affecting structural coherence.",
      "question": "Are there smooth transitions where the refrigerators meet the cabinets, without visible seams or edges that break the visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "In terms of retaining core elements and ensuring visual credibility, one must assess if the water dispensers on the refridgerators are accurately rendered and positioned, which is crucial for the designâ€™s authenticity.",
      "question": "Are the water dispensers on both refrigerators clearly defined and positioned appropriately, contributing to the overall realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
