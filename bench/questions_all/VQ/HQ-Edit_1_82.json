      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the gymnast’s figure into a semi-realistic cartoon style, this question evaluates whether the stylization preserves anatomical accuracy, particularly in the limbs and torso. The original image shows a well-proportioned gymnast; any distortion in limb length, joint angles, or muscle definition would compromise visual credibility. The focus is on the shape and structure of the legs, arms, and spine during the balance beam pose.",
      "question": "Do the gymnast’s limbs maintain natural joint angles and proportional lengths without exaggerated bends or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the leotard to feature flowy fabric and sequined patterns, this question assesses whether the texture and movement of the outfit appear consistent with the intended cartoon style. The original leotard has a tight fit and shiny surface; in the edited version, it should show fluidity and pattern detail without breaking apart or appearing pixelated.",
      "question": "Are the seams and fabric folds on the leotard clearly defined and flowing naturally, without jagged edges or unnatural creasing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying earthy tones throughout the scene, this question checks whether the color palette remains harmonious and free from jarring contrasts. The original image uses cool blues and whites; transitioning to earthy tones (e.g., browns, terracottas, olive greens) must be done smoothly to avoid visual dissonance.",
      "question": "Are the colors used in the gymnast’s outfit and background consistently within the earthy tone range without sudden shifts or clashing hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of introducing sequined patterns on the leotard, this question examines whether the sparkles or reflective elements are evenly spaced and integrated into the fabric design without appearing as random dots or digital noise. The original leotard has a red floral-like design; the sequins should enhance this motif without disrupting its clarity.",
      "question": "Are the sequin patterns aligned with the existing design on the leotard and uniformly distributed without clustering or overlapping in unnatural ways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering the image as a three-panel art print, this question evaluates whether the division between panels is clean and logical. The original image contains multiple gymnasts and a wide arena; splitting it into three panels must preserve continuity in motion and perspective, avoiding cuts through critical elements like heads or limbs.",
      "question": "Are the panel boundaries positioned so that key figures and objects (e.g., gymnast’s head, balance beam) are fully contained within one panel without being split or truncated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of framing the prints in a dark walnut tri-fold frame, this question checks whether the frame is accurately represented with proper wood grain, thickness, and shadowing. The frame should not overlap or distort the artwork, and its material should appear consistent with real wood.",
      "question": "Does the dark walnut frame have a uniform texture and depth, and does it sit flush around the artwork without casting unnatural shadows or appearing translucent?",
