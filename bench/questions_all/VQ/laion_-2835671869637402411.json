      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of evaluating the transformation of the anime girl into a Victorian-era doll, focusing on anatomical structure and natural appearance, this question assesses whether the limbs and facial features retain proportionality and avoid unnatural rigidity. The character’s arms, legs, and head must conform to expected doll-like proportions without excessive elongation or flattening.",
      "question": "Does the transformed character have correctly proportioned limbs and head with no signs of unnatural stiffness or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement assessing the new lace dress, this question evaluates whether the texture, layering, and lighting of the garment appear natural and consistent with the surrounding environment. The dress must show depth through folds and shading without flat or repetitive patterns.",
      "question": "Are the layers of the lace dress clearly defined with natural folds and shadows, and do they interact with light in a believable way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement checking the replacement of the basket with a wooden sewing kit, this question focuses on material accuracy, scale, and environmental integration. The kit must have visible wood grain, realistic tool placement, and cast shadows matching the scene’s lighting.",
      "question": "Does the wooden sewing kit have visible wood texture, appropriate internal components, and correct shadow alignment with the surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement evaluating the porcelain figurine replacing the cat, this question checks for material authenticity—specifically glossy surface, reflection, and form. The figurine must not appear flat or lack depth, and its size must match the original cat.",
      "question": "Is the porcelain figurine rendered with a smooth, reflective surface and accurate three-dimensional shape that matches the scale of the original cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement verifying the Victorian oil lamp replacement, this question examines geometric correctness, light emission, and shadow behavior. The lamp must have a functional design (e.g., glass chimney, metal base) and emit warm light that illuminates nearby surfaces realistically.",
      "question": "Does the oil lamp have a structurally sound design with visible glass and metal parts, and does it emit light that creates soft, realistic illumination and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement confirming the addition of the rocking chair, this question evaluates spatial logic and structural integrity. The chair must support the character’s weight, have curved rockers, and align with her posture without clipping or floating.",
      "question": "Is the rocking chair fully grounded, properly scaled beneath the character, and free from geometric distortions such as bent legs or missing joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement ensuring absence of digital artifacts, this question checks for visual imperfections across all edited elements. Edges should be clean, colors should not bleed, and textures should not repeat unnaturally.",
      "question": "Are all edited elements (doll, dress, chair, sewing kit, figurine, lamp) free from jagged edges, color bleeding, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
