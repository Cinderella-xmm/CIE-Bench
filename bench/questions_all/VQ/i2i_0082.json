      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires retaining the minimalist circular frame, which implies checking if the circular form remains intact and undistorted after editing.",

      "thinking_process": "Preserving the proportions of the clock hands is crucial for visual plausibility, so we assess whether the size relationships between the hour, minute, and second hands remain consistent.",
      "question": "Do the hour, minute, and second hands retain their original proportions and alignment, avoiding any distortion or misplacement?",
