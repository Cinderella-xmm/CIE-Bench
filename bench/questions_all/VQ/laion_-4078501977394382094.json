      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural integrity when adding anthropomorphic motion (roof tipping), evaluate whether the van’s roof appears to tilt naturally without breaking geometric continuity or introducing unnatural gaps or overlaps in the bodywork.",
      "question": "Does the roof of the van in Panel 1 tilt upward at a plausible angle without distorting the side panels or creating visible seams or breaks in the structure?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming a cactus into a water spout while preserving material and style consistency, assess whether the cactus-to-spout transition maintains smooth contours, consistent texture, and proper shadow alignment with the surrounding environment.",
      "question": "Is the cactus in Panel 2 transformed into a spout with continuous curves and matching texture, and does it cast a shadow consistent with the light source direction seen in the original image?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating new vegetation in Panel 3 without disrupting the original artistic style, evaluate whether the added plants use similar line thickness, color gradients, and shading techniques as the original cacti and sand.",
      "question": "Are the newly added plants around the oasis in Panel 3 rendered with the same level of detail and color harmony as the original cacti, and do they cast shadows that align with the scene’s lighting?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding text bubbles without visual interference, assess whether the text bubbles are placed in clear areas, have consistent stroke weight and lettering style, and do not obscure important elements like the van or cactus.",
      "question": "Are the text bubbles in all three panels positioned so they do not overlap critical parts of the van or landscape, and do they use a font style and size that matches the handwritten \"Road Trip\" title?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering splashing water realistically within the stylized context, evaluate whether the water droplets follow physical plausibility (e.g., curved trajectories, size variation) and interact properly with the ground and van.",
      "question": "Do the water splashes in Panel 3 show droplets with varied sizes and arcing paths, and do they appear to originate from the van’s side without floating unnaturally above the ground?",
      "choices": [

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving the van’s front structure during headlight animation, evaluate whether the headlights remain within the original grille area and maintain their circular shape without warping or extending beyond the body.",
      "question": "Are the headlights in Panel 2 enlarged and brightened but still contained within the original housing, and do they retain their round shape without stretching or clipping?",
