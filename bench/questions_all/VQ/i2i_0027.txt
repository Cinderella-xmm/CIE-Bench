Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "turning the dog into a chibi-style blind box figure while maintaining the prone, ball-focused pose," assess if the transformation affects the overall structural coherence and visual plausibility of the dog's body, particularly the pose and proportions.
Question: Does the dog's body maintain a natural and structurally consistent pose in the chibi-style, without any noticeable distortion or deformation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement to "enlarge the head slightly," evaluate if the head size modification integrates seamlessly into the overall image, avoiding unnatural effects like mismatched scale or texture disruption.
Question: Has the enlarged head been integrated naturally into the image, without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Referring to the sub requirement of "placing the ball touching the dog's nose," examine if this adjustment preserves the natural interaction between the dog and the ball, ensuring realistic contact and alignment in the scene.
Question: Is the tennis ball touching the dog's nose in a way that looks natural and physically plausible, without any awkward positioning?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement suggests a base with a relief tennis ball pattern should be added. Analyze if this addition to the original carpeted floor creates a visually credible environment that complements the scene's authenticity.
Question: Does the relief tennis ball pattern on the base match well with the rest of the scene, contributing to a cohesive and natural appearance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Considering the instruction to retain the ball-focused pose and the overall authenticity, ensure that the final composition retains the original focus on the ball while also incorporating the new stylized elements without disrupting the visual flow.
Question: Has the edited image retained the original focus on the ball while successfully integrating the chibi-style elements, resulting in a balanced and visually coherent composition?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
