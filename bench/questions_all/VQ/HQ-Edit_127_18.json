      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the entire scene into a diorama within a vintage travel case, evaluate whether the edges of the travel case are clearly defined and visually coherent with the rest of the scene. Check if the transition from the open savannah to a confined space introduces abrupt changes in lighting, depth, or framing that break realism.",
      "question": "Are the boundaries of the vintage travel case visible and seamlessly integrated into the scene without sudden shifts in perspective or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing natural grass with textured resin, assess whether the simulated grass maintains natural blade-like structures, proper density, and shadowing consistent with real grass under sunlight. Look for signs of uniformity, plasticity, or repeating patterns that suggest artificial material.",
      "question": "Does the textured resin grass show individual blades with natural variation in length and angle, and does it cast soft shadows consistent with the light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a tiny acacia tree for scale balance, determine whether the tree's size is proportionally smaller than the elephant and positioned at a distance that supports depth perception. Check if the tree appears distorted, stretched, or incorrectly scaled relative to the surrounding elements.",
      "question": "Is the miniature acacia tree significantly smaller than the elephant and placed at a distance that creates a believable sense of scale within the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of painting clouds on the backdrop lid, examine whether the clouds appear as part of the interior surface of the case rather than floating in the sky. Evaluate if they have matte finish, no reflections, and align with the ambient lighting of the scene.",
      "question": "Are the painted clouds located on the inner surface of the lid, showing no specular highlights or depth inconsistencies that would suggest they are floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing a brass compass on the base, check if the compass has a metallic sheen, engraved markings, and a fixed position on the surface without floating above it. Ensure there are no clipping issues or mismatched shadows.",
      "question": "Is the brass compass resting flat on the base with a clear reflection and shadow that matches the lighting direction and surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving the elephantâ€™s anatomy during scaling, verify that the skin folds, ear shape, trunk curvature, and tusk alignment remain anatomically accurate and undistorted. Look for any warping, stretching, or loss of detail in high-resolution areas.",
      "question": "Does the elephant retain natural skin texture, correct limb proportions, and intact tusk curvature without any visible deformation or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining compositional consistency, evaluate whether all elements (elephant, tree, grass, compass, clouds) share a unified light source and shadow direction. Check for conflicting shadows, such as those pointing toward different angles or appearing unnaturally sharp.",
      "question": "Do all objects in the diorama cast shadows in the same direction and with similar softness, consistent with a single light source from above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
