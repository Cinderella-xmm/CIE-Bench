Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a whimsical, anthropomorphic teddy bear scientist to the image, this involves inserting a new character into the scene. The position for this addition is likely in the central or lower-right area of the image, near the existing doodles and text. The question evaluates whether the inserted teddy bear maintains natural proportions, correct anatomical structure (e.g., limbs, facial features), and consistent texture with the surrounding illustrated elements. It also checks if the bear's integration into the scene avoids unnatural edges, color mismatches, or distortions that could break visual credibility.
Question: Is the anthropomorphic teddy bear scientist fully integrated into the image with smooth contours, consistent line weight, and no visible seams or misaligned textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of introducing playful lab equipment illustrations, these elements are expected to be added around the girl and across the greenboard background. These include items like beakers, test tubes, microscopes, or other scientific tools drawn in chalk style. The focus is on whether these objects maintain geometric accuracy (e.g., cylindrical shapes for beakers), appropriate scale relative to other doodles, and consistent drawing style (white outlines with red accents). Any distortion such as warped shapes or inconsistent proportions would compromise structural coherence.
Question: Are the lab equipment illustrations (e.g., beakers, test tubes) proportionally accurate, geometrically intact, and aligned with the hand-drawn chalk style without jagged edges or unnatural shading?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of enriching the backdrop with scientific symbols, formulas, and expressive doodles in vibrant chalk colors, the editing involves adding various symbols such as atoms, planets, rockets, and mathematical expressions. These elements must appear as if naturally drawn on the chalkboard surface. The evaluation focuses on whether the symbols are correctly shaped (e.g., planetary rings not broken, rocket fins properly angled), whether their placement follows logical spatial distribution, and whether they avoid overlapping in ways that suggest digital artifacts or layering errors.
Question: Do all scientific symbols and doodles (such as planets, rockets, and formulas) have intact geometric forms, proper alignment, and no overlapping artifacts or misplaced lines?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of incorporating playful typography around the elements (e.g., "JOYFUL", "CURIOSITY", "IMAGINATION"), the text should be placed in areas where it complements the visual composition. The font style should match the hand-drawn aesthetic of the doodles. The evaluation checks whether the text appears cleanly rendered, with consistent stroke thickness, no pixelation, and proper spacing. It also ensures the text does not interfere with underlying elements or appear distorted due to warping or scaling.
Question: Is the typography (e.g., "JOYFUL", "CURIOSITY") clearly legible, stylistically consistent with the doodles, and free from blurring, stretching, or misalignment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of including delightful animal characters engaging in scientific activities, such animals (e.g., a bear, rabbit, or bird) may be added interacting with lab tools or floating near the girl. Their presence must not disrupt the physical logic of the sceneâ€”e.g., animals should not appear floating without support unless stylized appropriately. The evaluation checks whether the animal characters have anatomically plausible forms, consistent with the cartoonish style, and whether their interactions with objects (like holding a magnifying glass) follow ergonomic and spatial logic.
Question: Do the animal characters (e.g., bear, rabbit) exhibit correct limb positioning, proportional body parts, and logical interaction with nearby objects without unnatural poses or deformations?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
