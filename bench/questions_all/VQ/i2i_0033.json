      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Considering the sub requirement regarding maintaining the person's jumping pose while transforming the image into an extreme sports series card illustration, we need to confirm if the modified pose retains structural coherence and natural appearance. The current image contains a person in a standing pose and no elements suggesting motion or a jumping pose. The transformation will likely introduce significant changes to the figure's posture.",
      "question": "Does the person retain a natural jumping pose that aligns with typical human biomechanics, avoiding any distortion or unnatural posturing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "According to the sub requirement to use a bold outline hand-drawn style in the transformation, we must verify if the edges and outlines of the individual and objects preserve their structural integrity and do not introduce artifacts like broken lines or excessive pixelation. The original image shows smooth and clean contours around the subject, indicating a need to carefully apply the cartoonish style.",
      "question": "Are the bold outlines applied to the person and surrounding elements smooth and continuous, without any jagged edges or breaks that would disrupt the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Given the sub requirement to mix abstract graffiti with concrete texture for the background, it is essential to assess if the combination creates a visually plausible environment that complements the figure while avoiding unnatural textures or overly blended elements that lose clarity. The original image has a blurred crowd background which needs to be replaced entirely.",
      "question": "Does the background blend the graffiti and concrete texture effectively, creating an authentic look without overlapping issues or blending that obscures either element's distinct characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "To address the sub requirement ensuring the retained core elements maintain structural consistency and visual credibility, specifically focusing on the individual's face and features, we need to ensure that even after stylization, the facial structure remains recognizable and undistorted. The original image features a detailed and clear facial expression.",
      "question": "Has the individual's face been preserved authentically within the new artistic style, retaining identifiable features like the eyes, nose, and mouth without distortion or excessive simplification?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "In line with the sub requirement to avoid introducing artifacts such as unnatural textures and loss of details, we need to check if key clothing items like the suit, tie, and shirt retain their details and patterns. The original image clearly displays these textures, so the stylization should respect them to some extent.",
      "question": "Do the details and patterns on the suit, tie, and shirt remain discernible within the hand-drawn style, avoiding any unnatural smudging or loss of defining characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
