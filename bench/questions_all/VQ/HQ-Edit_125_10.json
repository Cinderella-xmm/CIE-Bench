      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the Viking ship model into a historical-themed board game packaging, the sail design is to be repurposed as a game board layout. The original sail features a central Norse knotwork emblem and textured fabric. This transformation involves reinterpreting the sail’s visual elements into a grid or patterned surface suitable for gameplay. The question evaluates whether the texture and structure of the sail remain coherent when adapted into a game board, ensuring no unnatural distortions or loss of fine details in the transition.",
      "question": "Does the sail's surface retain its original fabric texture and intricate knotwork design when converted into a game board layout, without visible pixelation, warping, or inconsistent patterns?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding mini figures modeled after the rowers on the ship, the original image shows detailed miniature rowers with shields along the hull. These figures must be preserved or reimagined as game pieces. The question assesses whether these figures are proportionally accurate, structurally consistent with their original placement, and free from deformation or unnatural scaling when transformed into standalone game components.",
      "question": "Are the mini figures derived from the rowers positioned correctly along the hull, maintaining proportional size and anatomical structure without distortion or missing limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating Norse motifs into the artwork on the box cover, the original ship already contains ornate carvings on the dragon head and hull. The editing task requires extending these motifs across the packaging. The question checks whether the extended designs maintain continuity in style, line quality, and material appearance (e.g., wood grain or metal inlay), avoiding mismatched textures or abrupt transitions.",
      "question": "Do the Norse motifs extended onto the box cover match the original carving style and material appearance of the ship’s dragon head and hull, without jagged edges or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding bold typography for the title \"Voyage of the Vikings,\" this text will likely overlay the packaging design. The original image has a warm, candlelit ambiance with wooden textures and soft shadows. The question evaluates whether the typography integrates naturally into this environment—without harsh contrasts, clipping artifacts, or unnatural shadowing that breaks immersion.",
      "question": "Is the typography for \"Voyage of the Vikings\" clearly legible and stylistically consistent with the historical theme, without floating above the surface or casting unrealistic shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding wooden texture accents on the box sides for authenticity, the original image features a wooden base and table surface. The editing task involves applying similar wood grain textures to the side panels of the box. The question checks whether the new textures align with the existing wood patterns in terms of grain direction, color tone, and lighting response, ensuring no artificial seams or mismatched materials.",
      "question": "Do the wooden texture accents on the box sides match the grain pattern and lighting of the original wooden base and tabletop, without visible tiling or color inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
