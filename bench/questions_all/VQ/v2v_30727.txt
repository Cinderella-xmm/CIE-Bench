Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "adding a person unintentionally stepping on the zebra's tail, ensuring it does not affect the overall realism and natural appearance", judge whether the addition of the person at this position maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility.
Question: Does the person appear naturally integrated into the scene without any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of "the zebra appearing startled and partially turning its head toward the individual", evaluate if the zebra's reaction is consistent with the action of being stepped on and maintains physical rationality.
Question: Is the zebra's head turned in a way that looks natural and plausible for a startled reaction?
Choices: yes, no  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of "avoiding distortion such as unnatural textures and loss of details", assess if the texture and fine details of the zebra's stripes remain intact after editing.
Question: Are the zebra's stripes clear and detailed without any unnatural blurring or distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the sub requirement of "maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility", check if the interaction between the person's foot and the zebra's tail appears physically realistic.
Question: Does the person's foot look like it is realistically pressing down on the zebra's tail without breaking geometric shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "ensuring the retained core element ensures structural consistency and visual credibility", verify if the overall composition and layout of the image remain coherent after adding the person.
Question: Does the addition of the person maintain the overall composition and layout of the scene without disrupting the natural setting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
