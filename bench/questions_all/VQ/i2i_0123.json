      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Considering the sub requirement of changing the timer into a robotic dog holding a coin on the parking meter on the left side, we must evaluate if the addition of the robotic dog maintains the natural appearance and avoids introducing unnatural artifacts. The visual credibility depends on ensuring the robot and coin don't disrupt the timer area’s structure.",
      "question": "Does the robotic dog holding a coin blend seamlessly with the parking meter’s timer area, maintaining its structural coherence and avoiding obvious unnatural artifacts?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Focusing on the material and texture of the timer area which was replaced by the robotic dog, we need to ensure that the new elements retain a natural appearance comparable to the original material look.",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the robotic dog and the coin appear consistent with the rest of the parking meter, avoiding any unnatural or out-of-place surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The edited image should reflect a natural placement of the robotic dog within the timer, considering proportions and spatial realism. The physical logic and alignment between the robotic dog and the rest of the parking meter must remain intact.",
      "question": "Is the positioning of the robotic dog within the timer area proportional and physically realistic, without distorting or disrupting the geometry of the parking meter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The functionality described in the instructions requires the robot to hold a coin while still retaining the billing function. Thus, we need to confirm that this action does not interfere with the visual plausibility of the entire scene.",
      "question": "Does the robotic dog holding a coin logically coexist with the parking meter's billing function, ensuring both actions appear plausible and coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The composition of the edited image should maintain the visual credibility of the original scene. The addition of the robotic dog should not introduce any artifacts or inconsistencies that detract from the overall scene's authenticity.",
      "question": "Does the entire composition of the edited image, including the robotic dog and coin, appear authentic and consistent with the original scene without introducing any distracting or incongruous elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
