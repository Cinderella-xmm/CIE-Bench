      "thinking_process": "Given the need to preserve the natural appearance and authenticity while adding a shell-shaped base, we must consider if the new base blends well with the character and does not introduce unnatural textures or artifacts.",
      "question": "Is the shell-shaped base seamlessly integrated with the keychain, avoiding any evident artifacts or unnatural boundaries?",

      "thinking_process": "Evaluating the perceptual quality of the chibi transformation requires checking if the character retains its essential features and style without significant loss of detail, especially around critical areas like the face.",
      "question": "Have the character's facial features retained their distinctiveness in chibi form, without losing important details such as eye shape and mouth expression?",
