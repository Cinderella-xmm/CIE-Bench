      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"stylizing the woman into a cartoon form while maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility,\" evaluate whether the facial features, proportions, and body structure remain consistent with human anatomy and avoid distortions such as elongated limbs or misshapen joints. The original image shows a woman with natural proportions and balanced features; thus, any stylization must preserve core anatomical integrity.",
      "question": "Does the woman's face and body maintain natural proportions without exaggerated or distorted features such as uneven eyes, misplaced limbs, or unnatural curvature?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"enlarging and accentuating floral embroidery with gold highlights,\" assess whether the embroidered patterns on the dress are enlarged in a way that preserves their original shape and texture, and whether the addition of gold highlights appears integrated rather than overlaid or artificial. The original embroidery is delicate and follows natural floral contours; enlargement should not break geometric continuity.",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the dress enlarged proportionally without breaking their natural shape or causing jagged edges, and do the gold highlights blend seamlessly into the fabric texture?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"giving her dress radiant hues,\" evaluate whether the coloration of the dress has been altered to include luminous or glowing effects without introducing unnatural color gradients, halos, or pixelation. The original dress has soft, muted tones; radiant hues should enhance but not disrupt the material appearance.",
      "question": "Do the radiant hues applied to the dress appear smooth and evenly distributed without visible color bleeding, unnatural glow artifacts, or disrupted fabric texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"incorporating abstract bamboo shadows for depth,\" assess whether the added shadows maintain plausible lighting direction and density, and whether they overlap naturally with the bamboo background without creating floating or disconnected shadow regions. The original scene has directional light filtering through bamboo; shadows should follow this logic.",
      "question": "Do the abstract bamboo shadows align with the existing light source and cast believable depth without appearing detached, inconsistent, or overlapping incorrectly with the figure or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding a blank bamboo-shaped writing panel framed with soft watercolor bamboo motifs,\" evaluate whether the panelâ€™s shape matches the bamboo aesthetic, its placement is structurally coherent within the scene, and the watercolor motifs do not introduce textural inconsistencies or sharp edges. The panel should appear integrated into the environment without disrupting spatial logic.",
      "question": "Is the bamboo-shaped writing panel positioned naturally within the scene, with smooth edges and watercolor motifs that match the surrounding textures and do not exhibit harsh lines or unnatural blending?",
