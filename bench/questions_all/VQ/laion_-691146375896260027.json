      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the dark wood body with brown LEGO bricks, this question evaluates whether the brick texture across the main body of the dresser appears uniform and properly scaled relative to the original dimensions. It checks for artifacts such as uneven brick spacing, visible seams, or misalignment that could disrupt the illusion of a cohesive LEGO build.",
      "question": "Are the brown LEGO bricks covering the dresser body evenly spaced and aligned, with no visible gaps or irregularities in the surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reconstructing the marquetry pattern using small interlocking LEGO pieces, this question assesses whether the geometric herringbone design on the front panels is accurately represented and retains clarity despite being made of discrete blocks. It focuses on whether the pattern appears fragmented or distorted due to poor scaling or placement.",
      "question": "Is the herringbone marquetry pattern on the front panels clearly defined and continuous, without broken lines or missing segments caused by improper LEGO piece placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the gold brass inlays with gold-colored LEGO elements, this question examines whether the ornate scrollwork along the edges and center of the dresser maintains its fluid, curvilinear form when rendered in LEGO. It checks for angular distortions or abrupt transitions that would betray the use of rigid building blocks.",
      "question": "Do the gold decorative borders follow the original curved contours smoothly, without sharp angles or breaks in the flow of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replicating the curved side profiles and cabriole legs using sloped LEGO bricks, this question evaluates whether the curves of the dresser’s sides and legs are smoothly formed and structurally coherent. It checks for stepped or blocky transitions that would violate the natural curvature of the original design.",
      "question": "Are the curved side panels and cabriole legs constructed with smoothly joined sloped bricks, showing no visible steps or angular breaks in the profile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of substituting the marble top with gray flat LEGO tiles, this question verifies whether the new top surface matches the original’s rectangular shape and edge alignment, and whether it sits flush with the dresser body without overhangs or gaps. It ensures material replacement does not compromise dimensional accuracy.",
      "question": "Does the gray LEGO tile top sit flat and level on the dresser, with clean edges and no visible gaps or misalignments where it meets the sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
