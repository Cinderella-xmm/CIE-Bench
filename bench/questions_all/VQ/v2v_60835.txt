Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "seamlessly integrating ornate steampunk mechanisms into their forms," specifically focusing on the leg joints being replaced with polished brass pistons and gears, we need to evaluate if these modifications maintain structural coherence and visual plausibility without introducing unnatural textures or distortions.
Question: Do the brass pistons and gears replacing the cheetahs' leg joints appear structurally coherent and free from unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of "their spotted fur subtly transitioning into tooled leather and copper plating in patches," we need to assess if this transition is visually credible and maintains the natural appearance of the cheetahs' fur.
Question: Does the transition from spotted fur to tooled leather and copper plating look natural and free from obvious artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of "their eyes replaced with glowing amber lenses," we need to evaluate if this modification preserves the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the cheetahs' faces.
Question: Are the glowing amber lenses in place of the cheetahs' eyes integrated naturally without disrupting the visual credibility of their faces?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "the distant savanna horizon featuring towering, fantastical clockwork structures under a sky streaked with coppery clouds," we need to check if these additions maintain the scene's structural consistency and do not introduce visual distortions.
Question: Do the fantastical clockwork structures and coppery clouds in the background integrate seamlessly with the savanna horizon without causing visual distortions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement of "avoiding the introduction of artifacts such as unnatural textures and loss of details," we need to ensure that the fine details of the cheetahs and the environment remain intact after the edits.
Question: Have the fine details of the cheetahs and the environment been preserved without loss or introduction of unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
