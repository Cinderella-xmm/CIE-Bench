Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the colorful dress into flowing celestial robes with gold and silver filigree, evaluate whether the material texture and color transition of the dress maintain natural appearance and structural coherence. The original dress has intricate patterns and vibrant colors; thus, the reimagined celestial robes must preserve visual continuity in pattern flow and avoid unnatural textures or abrupt material shifts.
Question: Does the transformed dress exhibit smooth, flowing fabric folds consistent with celestial robes, without visible pixelation, unnatural sheen, or disrupted geometric patterns?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of embellishing the dress with gold and silver filigree, assess whether the added decorative elements are integrated seamlessly into the fabric without introducing artifacts such as floating lines, inconsistent lighting, or misplaced metallic highlights. The filigree should follow the contours of the robe naturally.
Question: Are the gold and silver filigree details aligned with the fabricâ€™s surface and lighting direction, showing no floating or misaligned edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the wheat field with heavenly clouds, evaluate whether the new cloud formation maintains plausible volume, softness, and depth relative to the figure's position. The original golden wheat has defined stalks and height; the replacement must not introduce flat or unnaturally layered cloud shapes.
Question: Do the clouds beneath the figure have volumetric form and gradient shading that match the perspective and scale of the scene, avoiding flat or cartoonish rendering?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of changing the sky to a starry night backdrop with subtle halos and dawn hues, assess whether the sky transition preserves atmospheric depth and light consistency. The original bright blue sky with scattered clouds must be replaced without creating unnatural gradients or mismatched light sources.
Question: Is the starry night sky blended smoothly with dawn hues near the horizon, maintaining consistent illumination and avoiding abrupt color transitions or misplaced stars?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of the figure holding ethereal, glowing wisps in each hand, evaluate whether the hands retain anatomical accuracy (five fingers, natural joint positioning) and whether the wisps appear as soft, luminous extensions without clipping or distortion. The original hands are clearly visible and well-formed; any editing must preserve this.
Question: Do both hands show five distinct fingers with natural proportions and skin texture, and do the glowing wisps emerge from the palms without intersecting or distorting the hand structure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
