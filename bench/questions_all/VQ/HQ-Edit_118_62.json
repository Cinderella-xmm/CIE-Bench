      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the pigeon into a plush toy with subtly exaggerated features, evaluate whether the bird's body retains a plausible three-dimensional form despite being made of soft material. Specifically, check if limbs and head are proportionally enlarged or rounded in a way consistent with plush toys, and whether the overall silhouette remains stable and not warped.",
      "question": "Does the plush pigeon have a rounded, soft-bodied shape with no visible distortion in limbs or head, and does it maintain a natural posture consistent with a seated stuffed animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying vibrant blue to the chest and gray to the wings with subtle feather patterns, assess whether the colors are smoothly blended across the plush surface and whether the patterns resemble stitched or printed designs typical of fabric toys. Check for any jagged edges, unnatural gradients, or areas where the texture breaks down into pixels or noise.",
      "question": "Are the blue and gray areas on the plush pigeonâ€™s body evenly colored with soft transitions, and do the feather-like patterns appear as continuous, low-relief designs on fabric rather than sharp, digital lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering architectural structures as cookie edifices with embossed details, examine whether the stone columns, arch, and distant towers now exhibit a matte, slightly porous texture resembling baked goods. Check if the embossed carvings retain their depth and clarity, and whether the lighting suggests a non-reflective, sugary surface.",
      "question": "Do the architectural elements (columns, arch, distant buildings) display a uniform, matte surface with visible embossed details that resemble cookie dough or icing, and do they lack shiny reflections or metallic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the plush pigeon on a simple wooden shelf, verify whether the shelf is present, correctly positioned beneath the pigeon, and visually integrated into the scene. Assess whether the wood grain is consistent, the edges are clean, and the shelf casts a shadow that matches the direction and intensity of the ambient light.",
      "question": "Is there a wooden shelf beneath the plush pigeon that is flat, horizontally aligned, and has visible wood grain and natural edge wear, with a shadow extending downward and to the right consistent with the sky light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring overall visual credibility through coherent lighting and material interaction, evaluate whether the lighting across all elements (plush pigeon, wooden shelf, cookie architecture) is consistent. Check for shadows that align with the light source, absence of floating objects, and proper occlusion between elements (e.g., the pigeon casting a shadow on the shelf).",
      "question": "Do all elements in the image (plush pigeon, shelf, cookie structures) share the same lighting direction and shadow behavior, with no overlapping shadows or missing occlusions that suggest inconsistent depth or positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
