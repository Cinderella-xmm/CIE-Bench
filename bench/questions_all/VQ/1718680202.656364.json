      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding cartoonish beach-themed stickers on the capybara’s beanie\", evaluate whether the stickers are seamlessly integrated into the knitted texture of the blue beanie without disrupting the material consistency or introducing unnatural textures. The position is the top and side areas of the beanie, where stickers would logically appear. Check for visual artifacts such as mismatched edges, unnatural shading, or texture breaks.",
      "question": "Are the beach-themed stickers on the capybara's beanie clearly visible and seamlessly blended into the knit fabric without any jagged edges or texture distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"enhancing the vivid blues in the hat and beverage\", assess whether the color enhancement of the blue beanie and the drink maintains natural color gradients and does not introduce over-saturation, banding, or unnatural highlights that break realism. The editing targets are the blue beanie (head area) and the beverage (held in hand). Evaluate if the enhanced colors still align with physical lighting conditions.",
      "question": "Is the blue color of the beanie and the beverage uniformly saturated without unnatural color bleeding or digital halos around the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"designing a bold, playful font arching above the Opera House\", evaluate whether the typography is properly positioned above the Opera House structure without distorting the background architecture or overlapping incorrectly. The text should not obscure key features of the building or appear floating unnaturally. Check for alignment with the horizon and perspective consistency.",
      "question": "Does the arched typography sit correctly above the Opera House without distorting its shape or creating visual inconsistencies in scale and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"blending vibrant illustrations with photorealism\", examine the capybara’s hand holding the drink to ensure anatomical correctness—specifically, the number of fingers, their proportions, and natural positioning. The hand must conform to realistic primate anatomy and not show extra digits or unnatural bending. Also check for consistent skin texture and shadowing.",
      "question": "Does the capybara’s hand holding the drink have five fingers with natural spacing, ergonomic curvature, and realistic texture without distortion or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility\", evaluate the interaction between the capybara and the environment—specifically, whether the capybara’s posture, the angle of the drink, and the reflection on the water surface maintain spatial logic. Check if the light direction matches across the capybara, drink, and background (e.g., sunset glow), ensuring no conflicting shadows or lighting.",
      "question": "Do the lighting and reflections on the capybara, the drink, and the water surface align consistently with the direction of the sunset in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
