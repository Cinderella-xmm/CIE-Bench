      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the Brooklyn Bridge’s twin towers into arms, this question evaluates whether the stone material and structural form of the towers have been preserved during the transformation. The original towers are made of stone with defined arches and vertical lines; any deviation such as uneven scaling, broken geometry, or loss of masonry texture would compromise authenticity. The arms should extend upward and outward in a way that aligns with the original tower positions, without bending unnaturally or introducing jagged edges.",
      "question": "Do the transformed towers retain the original stone texture and structural lines, and are they shaped into arms without geometric distortion or unnatural breaks?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using the suspension cables as sinewy tendons wrapped around the chest, this question checks if the cables maintain their metallic appearance and continuity while being reinterpreted as biological tendons. The cables should follow natural curves around the chest area, resembling muscle fibers, but without appearing frayed, duplicated, or detached from the bridge structure. Any unnatural texture (e.g., plastic-like shine) or inconsistent thickness would reduce perceived realism.",
      "question": "Are the suspension cables rendered as continuous, sinewy tendons with consistent metallic texture and natural curvature around the chest area, without fraying or abrupt changes in thickness?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the Freedom Tower into a crystalline crown, this question assesses whether the new crown maintains transparency, faceted geometry, and realistic light refraction. The original tower is a smooth glass skyscraper; transforming it into a crown requires adding sharp edges and reflective surfaces without introducing blocky artifacts or unnatural color shifts. The crown should sit atop the golem’s head, aligned with the original tower’s position, and not appear floating or misaligned.",
      "question": "Is the Freedom Tower transformed into a crown with clear, faceted crystal surfaces that reflect light naturally and are positioned directly above the golem’s head without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using skyscrapers as armor plating, this question evaluates whether the buildings in the background have been integrated into the golem’s body in a seamless manner. The armor should resemble interlocking plates with visible seams and consistent material properties (glass, steel, concrete), but without gaps, overlapping errors, or missing sections. The layout must follow the contours of the golem’s torso, maintaining visual coherence with the rest of the structure.",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers seamlessly integrated into the golem’s body as armor plating, with no visible gaps, overlaps, or misaligned building edges?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of the golem having a majestic, looming stance firmly anchored in the cityscape, this question checks the physical grounding of the structure. The golem’s base must remain connected to the water and land, with no floating legs or disconnected supports. The proportions of the legs and torso should be consistent with the scale of the surrounding buildings and bridge, avoiding disproportionate size or unnatural angles that suggest instability.",
      "question": "Is the golem’s base fully anchored to the ground and water, with no floating or disconnected limbs, and does its overall scale match the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
