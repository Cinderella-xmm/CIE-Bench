Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "character portrayal: showcase a wise elder in traditional attire interacting with the duck chess set, capturing his thoughtful demeanor", evaluate whether the elderly man's facial features, expression, and posture maintain natural human anatomy and proportions. The original image shows an elderly man with white hair and beard, wearing traditional robes, leaning over a chessboard. Editing must preserve anatomical accuracy, especially in facial structure and hand positioning, to avoid unnatural distortions or artifacts.
Question: Does the elder’s face show natural skin texture, realistic wrinkles, and facial proportions without distortion or unnatural smoothing?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "adding intricate trees and a reflecting pond to enrich the serene setting", assess whether the trees and water body integrate seamlessly into the scene. The original image already contains trees and a pond; editing should enhance these elements while maintaining geometric coherence, reflection consistency, and natural foliage density. Attention is needed for tree trunks, leaf patterns, and water surface reflections to ensure they appear plausible and undistorted.
Question: Are the tree trunks and branches in the background structurally coherent, with natural bark texture and no broken or warped shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "add intricate trees and a reflecting pond", evaluate the water surface for accurate reflection behavior. The original image includes a calm pond reflecting surrounding trees and light. After editing, the reflection must match the environment above, showing consistent lighting, clarity, and proportionality. Any mismatch or artificial sheen would compromise visual credibility.
Question: Does the water surface reflect the surrounding trees and sky accurately, with smooth gradients and no distorted or duplicated elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "duck chess set" and "traditional attire", assess whether the rubber ducks used as chess pieces maintain consistent material appearance and spatial logic. The original image shows green, pink, and yellow duck-shaped pieces arranged on a chessboard. Editing must preserve their form, color, and placement so that they appear physically plausible—no floating, clipping, or unnatural scaling—and align with the board’s grid.
Question: Are the duck-shaped chess pieces positioned correctly on the chessboard squares without overlapping, floating, or misalignment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "typography: elegant calligraphy for the title on the lower right", evaluate whether the added text integrates naturally into the composition. The original image has no text; thus, adding calligraphy must not obscure objects, create visual clutter, or introduce pixelation or jagged edges. The style must harmonize with the Japanese woodblock aesthetic while remaining legible and spatially balanced.
Question: Is the calligraphy text placed in the lower right corner without overlapping key elements, and does it have clean lines and natural ink-like texture?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
