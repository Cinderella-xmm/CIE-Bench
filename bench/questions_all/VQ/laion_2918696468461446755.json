      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding trench coats and fedoras to all characters, this question evaluates whether the clothing modifications preserve realistic fabric behavior and anatomical proportions. Specifically, it checks for unnatural folds, misaligned seams, or disproportionate garment sizes that could break visual credibility.",
      "question": "Do the trench coats and fedoras on all characters have natural fabric draping and proper fit without visible distortion or clipping against limbs?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the background with a grayscale foggy cityscape, this question assesses whether the new environment integrates seamlessly with the characters and maintains consistent depth and lighting. It checks for abrupt edges, missing details, or unnatural gradients that would compromise realism.",
      "question": "Is the grayscale foggy cityscape background smoothly blended with the characters, showing consistent atmospheric perspective and no sharp boundaries or lost architectural details?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of equipping the central character with a magnifying glass, this question examines the integration of the object into his hand. It focuses on hand anatomy, grip logic, and object scale to ensure physical plausibility and avoid deformation.",
      "question": "Does the central character’s hand holding the magnifying glass show five fingers with natural curvature and grip, and is the magnifying glass proportionally sized and positioned as if being used realistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of retaining the central character’s eyepatch while applying a noir style, this question verifies whether the eyepatch remains visually consistent with the character’s face and lighting conditions, avoiding mismatches in shading or texture.",
      "question": "Is the eyepatch on the central character’s face aligned with his facial structure and consistently shaded with the surrounding skin and lighting, without appearing detached or unnaturally bright/dark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing typography to a classic serif font and adding secondary text, this question evaluates the layout and clarity of the text. It checks for proper alignment, spacing, and legibility without overlapping or distorting other elements.",
      "question": "Are the title “Whispers of Shadows” and subtitle “A Mysterious Journey” displayed in a serif font at the top, properly spaced, readable, and not overlapping any character or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of highlighting book edges with subtle blood-red streaks, this question assesses whether the red streaks are applied with smooth gradients and consistent opacity, avoiding pixelation, jagged lines, or unnatural color bleeding.",
      "question": "Are the blood-red streaks along the book edges smoothly rendered with uniform color intensity and no visible artifacts such as jagged edges or noise?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
