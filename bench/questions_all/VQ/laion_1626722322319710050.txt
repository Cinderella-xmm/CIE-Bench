Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction involves transforming the statue and its base into a detailed miniature scene within a glass dome. This requires significant structural and material changes to the original elements, including replacing the stone statue with a metallic 3D figure, introducing translucent trees, adding engraved plaques, and constructing a glass dome with a polished stone stand featuring vine patterns. These modifications affect multiple regions of the image: the statue (top), the pedestal (middle), the surrounding environment (background), and the newly introduced dome structure (overhead). Each change must maintain visual coherence, realistic textures, proper proportions, and avoid artifacts such as distorted geometry or unnatural lighting. The transformation from real-world materials (stone, cloth) to artificial ones (metal, glass, translucent leaves) demands careful handling to preserve authenticity and plausibility.

-Sub requirement 1: Replace the original stone statue with a sleek metallic 3D figure—evaluate whether the new figure maintains anatomical correctness, proportionality, and natural surface texture without visible rendering artifacts or geometric distortions.
-Sub requirement 2: Introduce translucent trees with delicate leaves around the statue—assess whether these trees have plausible leaf transparency, consistent lighting interaction, and realistic placement relative to the scale of the statue and base.
-Sub requirement 3: Add engraved mini plaques on the base—check if the text is legible, proportionally scaled, and integrated naturally into the base’s surface without appearing pasted or misaligned.
-Sub requirement 4: Construct a glass dome enclosing the entire scene—verify that the dome has clear, smooth curvature, no jagged edges, and accurate reflections/refractions consistent with transparent material properties.
-Sub requirement 5: Design the dome stand with polished stone finish and vine patterns—ensure the stone appears uniformly textured, the vines are intricately but realistically carved, and the overall design complements the historical aesthetic of the original monument.
-Sub requirement 6: Maintain structural consistency between all added elements—the dome should not intersect improperly with the statue or base, and all components should align spatially and physically in a believable manner.
-Sub requirement 7: Preserve fine details such as folds in clothing, facial features, and inscriptions—confirm that these remain sharp and coherent even after transformation, avoiding blurring or loss of resolution due to editing.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the original stone statue with a sleek metallic 3D figure, this question evaluates whether the new figure retains anatomical accuracy and realistic material appearance. The hand position near the chest is critical for assessing finger count, joint alignment, and surface texture. Any deviation from natural human form or presence of unnatural sheen or edges would compromise realism.
Question: Does the metallic statue have five fingers on each hand, with natural joint angles and smooth surface transitions, and no visible seams or distorted geometry?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of introducing translucent trees with delicate leaves, this question checks the visual integration and physical plausibility of the new foliage. The trees must appear small enough to be miniature, with leaves showing translucency under ambient light, and must not overlap or clash with the statue or base in an implausible way.
Question: Are the leaves of the miniature trees semi-transparent, allowing light to pass through them, and positioned at a distance from the statue that matches their reduced scale without overlapping the figure unnaturally?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding engraved mini plaques on the base, this question assesses whether the plaques are properly scaled, legibly inscribed, and seamlessly embedded into the stone surface. Misalignment, inconsistent depth, or floating appearance would indicate poor integration.
Question: Are the engraved plaques flush with the base surface, with readable text and consistent depth, and do they follow the contour of the pedestal without appearing detached or warped?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of constructing a glass dome, this question examines the dome’s shape, clarity, and optical behavior. A realistic dome must have smooth curvature, reflect surrounding elements appropriately, and not introduce distortions like pixelation, ghosting, or incorrect refraction.
Question: Is the glass dome fully transparent with smooth, continuous curvature, showing accurate reflections of nearby objects and sky, and free from jagged edges or internal distortions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of designing the dome stand with polished stone and vine patterns, this question evaluates the material fidelity and decorative detail. The stone must appear uniformly polished, and the vines must be intricately carved yet structurally sound, matching the historical style of the original monument.
Question: Does the dome stand feature a polished stone surface with subtle texture variation, and are the vine patterns clearly defined, following natural growth patterns without breaking or repeating unnaturally?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency across all elements, this question ensures that the dome does not intersect incorrectly with the statue or base, and that all components are spatially aligned as if part of a single cohesive scene.
Question: Is the glass dome positioned above the statue and base without clipping through any part of the figure or pedestal, and does it rest securely on the dome stand without floating or tilting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
