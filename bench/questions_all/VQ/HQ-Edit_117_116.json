      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the wings must appear translucent and shimmering like cascading waterfalls, this evaluates whether the wing texture and lighting effects are natural and free from digital artifacts. The original wings are clear and veined; the edited version must retain similar structure but with added fluidity and shimmer. The question focuses on the visual fidelity of the wing material.",
      "question": "Do the wings display a smooth, translucent gradient resembling flowing water without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural banding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The body transformation into iridescent, scaly textures with blue swirls must maintain biological plausibility while introducing fantasy elements. The original body is segmented and solid-colored; the edited version must show scale-like patterns that follow the dragonfly’s anatomy without breaking continuity or introducing unnatural shapes.",
      "question": "Are the scales on the dragonfly’s body evenly distributed, aligned with its natural segmentation, and do they exhibit smooth color transitions without abrupt edges or repetitive patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The eyes have been modified to reflect ocean depths, requiring internal detail that suggests depth and light refraction. The original eyes are spherical and red; the new version must preserve shape while adding complexity. This checks whether the eye modification introduces realistic depth cues without distorting the spherical form.",
      "question": "Do the eyes retain their spherical shape and contain layered, dark blue internal structures that suggest depth, without appearing flattened or unnaturally textured?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Luminescent vines entwining the legs must appear physically plausible—attached at natural points, not floating or clipping through limbs. The vines should emit a soft glow without harsh outlines or halo artifacts. This assesses both spatial logic and material realism.",
      "question": "Are the aquatic vines wrapped around the dragonfly’s legs in a continuous, non-intersecting manner, with a soft glowing edge that does not bleed into surrounding areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The faint mist aura must surround the dragonfly without obscuring it or creating unnatural boundaries. It should blend smoothly with the background and lighting, maintaining atmospheric depth. This evaluates environmental integration and artifact absence.",
      "question": "Is the mist evenly diffused around the dragonfly, fading gradually into the air without sharp edges, clumping, or unnatural brightness spikes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The reflection in the water must mirror the edited dragonfly accurately, including wing transparency, body colors, and any added elements like vines and mist. The reflection should follow water physics—slightly distorted, dimmer, and symmetrical.",
      "question": "Does the reflection in the water accurately depict the edited dragonfly’s features, including wings, body patterns, and vines, with appropriate distortion and reduced brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
