      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the gullwing doors into shoulder buttons, evaluate whether the shape and placement of the doors now resemble functional shoulder buttons on a gaming controller. The original doors are upward-opening and symmetrical; they must be reshaped into raised, convex button forms while retaining their hinge points and not distorting the car’s side profile. This affects structural consistency and visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are the gullwing doors reshaped into raised, rounded button-like structures symmetrically placed on both sides of the car, with smooth transitions from the body and no visible warping or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the front grille into a directional pad, assess whether the grille has been restructured into a cross-shaped layout with four distinct sections resembling up/down/left/right controls. The original grille has a horizontal slatted pattern; it must now appear segmented but still integrated within the front bumper area without breaking its outline or causing misalignment.",
      "question": "Is the front grille redesigned into a four-segment cross-shaped directional pad with evenly spaced and aligned sections, centered beneath the Mercedes emblem, and free from overlapping or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying a sleek metallic red finish with gloss highlights, check whether the surface reflects light uniformly across all curved panels, especially the hood, roof, and fenders. The reflection should follow natural lighting direction and show no inconsistent shine, banding, or matte patches that suggest poor rendering.",
      "question": "Does the entire exterior surface exhibit consistent metallic red coloring with smooth gloss highlights that follow the curvature of the body and reflect ambient light realistically without abrupt transitions or flat areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding intricate emblem detailing on the dashboard button area, verify that the emblem is present inside the cabin, near the center console, and matches the style of a gaming controller’s central button. It should be clearly defined, properly lit, and integrated into the dashboard without appearing as a floating overlay or misaligned graphic.",
      "question": "Is there a detailed emblem located on the dashboard area, resembling a central control button, with clear lines and shading that match the surrounding interior materials and do not appear displaced or blurry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of displaying branding on the hood shaped as a center control logo, determine if a stylized logo is centered on the hood, designed to look like a game controller’s central button (e.g., circular with symbols or text), and physically integrated into the surface without distortion or mismatched depth.",
      "question": "Is a branded logo placed centrally on the hood, shaped like a circular control element with defined edges and consistent depth, and aligned with the car’s longitudinal axis without tilting or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring overall structural coherence, examine whether the transformed elements (doors, grille, hood) remain connected to the car body without visible gaps, overlaps, or geometric distortions. The car’s silhouette should remain intact, and all edits should respect the original proportions and spatial logic.",
      "question": "Are all edited components (shoulder buttons, D-pad grille, hood logo) fully attached to the car body with no floating parts, misaligned joints, or unnatural bends in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts, inspect the image for signs of digital manipulation errors such as jagged edges, texture repetition, ghosting, or unnatural reflections—especially at transition zones between edited and original areas like door hinges, grille edges, and hood seams.",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, repeated patterns, or unnatural reflections at the boundaries of edited regions (e.g., door edges, grille perimeter, hood logo)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
