      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the suitcase into a tall, rectangular glass vessel, evaluate whether the reshaping of the overall structure maintains geometric coherence and structural consistency. The original suitcase has a defined rectangular shape with rounded corners and a consistent volume; the edited version must preserve plausible proportions without collapsing or distorting edges. This involves checking if the new form retains a balanced height-to-width ratio typical of a perfume bottle while avoiding unnatural tapering or bulging.",
      "question": "Does the transformed object maintain a tall, rectangular silhouette with smooth, continuous vertical sides and no visible warping or collapsed edges?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the retractable handle into a metallic spray nozzle, assess whether the handle's transformation preserves structural logic and material plausibility. The original handle is a two-part telescopic mechanism at the top center; it must now appear as a sleek, integrated metallic nozzle aligned with the top of the glass body. Evaluate if the transition from fabric-covered handle to metal nozzle is seamless and free from texture mismatch or misaligned joints.",
      "question": "Is the retractable handle replaced by a metallic spray nozzle that appears seamlessly attached to the top of the vessel, with no visible seams or material discontinuities?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing fabric panels with translucent purple-tinted glass sections, evaluate whether the material substitution is visually coherent. The original suitcase features textured dark blue fabric with visible stitching patterns. The new design should show translucent purple glass with embossed linear patterns mimicking the original seam lines. Check for unnatural opacity, inconsistent light transmission, or loss of fine detail in the embossed lines.",
      "question": "Are the fabric panels replaced with translucent purple-tinted glass that shows uniform translucency and clearly defined embossed linear patterns matching the original seam locations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding an elegant logo etched near the top, evaluate whether the logo placement and style are consistent with the new glass surface. The original logo is located on the upper front panel; the edited version must retain this position but now as an etched design on glass. Assess if the etching appears shallow and clear, without distortion, ghosting, or artificial glow effects that suggest digital overlay artifacts.",
      "question": "Is the logo positioned near the top center of the front face and rendered as a clean, subtle etching on the glass surface without any visible digital artifacts or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting wheels into decorative caps, evaluate whether the wheel transformation maintains aesthetic balance and structural credibility. The original suitcase has four multi-directional spinner wheels at the base corners. These must be replaced with static decorative caps that match the overall premium design. Check if the caps are symmetrical, properly sized relative to the body, and lack mechanical details like axles or bearings that would contradict their decorative purpose.",
      "question": "Are the four wheels replaced with identical decorative caps at each corner of the base, appearing as solid, polished elements without exposed mechanical parts or asymmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
