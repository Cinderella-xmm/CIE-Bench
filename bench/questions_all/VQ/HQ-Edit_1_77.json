      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the central figure into a Maasai warrior painting, this question evaluates whether the facial features and body proportions remain anatomically accurate after the style change. The transformation must not distort the eyes, nose, mouth, or limbs in a way that violates human anatomy.",
      "question": "Are the facial features and body proportions of the central figure preserved and undistorted despite the artistic transformation?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding historical Maasai motifs to the blue garment, this question checks whether the patterns are evenly distributed, correctly aligned with the fabric folds, and free from visual artifacts such as misaligned lines or pixelation. The design must integrate naturally with the existing texture of the dress.",
      "question": "Are the added Maasai motifs on the blue garment aligned with the fabric's folds and free from jagged edges or broken lines?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enhancing bead ornaments with glowing elements, this question assesses whether the glow appears as a soft, localized emission without causing unnatural light spillage or halo effects on adjacent areas like skin or clothing. The glow should not make the beads appear to float or detach from the body.",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements on the bead ornaments emit light in a controlled manner without creating halos or color bleed onto the skin or fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the background into an oil painting style, this question evaluates whether the brush strokes are consistent across the scene and do not distort the shapes of natural elements such as trees, hills, or sky. The horizon line and spatial relationships must remain intact despite the stylistic shift.",
      "question": "Are the brush strokes in the background evenly applied and do they preserve the correct shapes and positions of trees, terrain, and horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of retaining bead ornaments and facial features, this question checks whether the retained elements maintain their original structure and material appearance. Specifically, it verifies that the beads on the neck, arms, and headpiece are intact, properly shaped, and not fragmented or distorted by the editing process.",
      "question": "Are the bead ornaments on the neck, arms, and headpiece fully intact with no missing, duplicated, or warped segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
