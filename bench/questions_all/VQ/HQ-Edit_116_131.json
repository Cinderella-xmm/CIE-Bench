The editing target is the embroidered flowers on the front and sleeves of the qipao.",

The editing target is the closure area at the center front of the qipao.",
      "question": "Do the jade-patterned clasps align correctly along the central seam and display consistent shape and size without deformation?",

The editing target includes the entire fabric surface, especially the red base and decorative elements.",

The editing target is any newly inserted panel or section near the qipao.",
      "question": "Are the detachable writing sections placed with clean edges and consistent lighting, and do they appear anchored to the garment rather than floating?",

The editing target is the right hand holding the qipao near the chest.",
      "question": "Does the hand show five fingers with normal spacing, natural curvature, and no extra or missing digits?",
