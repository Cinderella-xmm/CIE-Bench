      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the clothing and body of all three figures to include ocean-themed armor, this question evaluates whether the armor's integration preserves anatomical structure and avoids unnatural distortions. Specifically, the central figure’s torso and arms must retain natural proportions, and the armor should not cause bulging, stretching, or geometric breaks.",
      "question": "Do the armor elements on the central figure's torso and arms follow natural human body contours without causing distorted shapes or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring natural textures for the armor materials (coral, waves), this question checks whether the textures appear seamless and physically plausible. The rightmost figure’s jacket area, where armor might be applied, should not show repeating patterns, blurring, or artificial layering.",
      "question": "Are the textures of the ocean-themed armor on the rightmost figure’s jacket smooth and continuous without visible tiling or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving hand anatomy, this question focuses on the visible right hand of the rightmost figure. The number of fingers, spacing, and joint alignment must conform to human ergonomics. Any added armor should not increase finger count or deform joints.",
      "question": "Does the right hand of the rightmost figure have exactly five fingers with natural spacing and joint curvature, even with armor applied?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enhancing the sky with vivid blues and purples while maintaining smooth gradients, this question assesses whether the color transition from orange near the horizon to blue/purple above is seamless and free of banding or sharp edges.",
      "question": "Is the sky gradient from the horizon upward smooth and free of color banding or abrupt transitions between orange, blue, and purple hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding weathered, ocean-spray-style typography at the bottom, this question checks whether the text integrates naturally without jagged edges, misalignment, or texture repetition. The text should be positioned below the figures and not overlap with critical elements like the sea or rocks.",
      "question": "Is the typography at the bottom of the image clearly legible, properly aligned, and textured with ocean-spray effects without repeating patterns or sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating subtle ocean creature motifs into the armor, this question evaluates whether these elements are small, contextually appropriate, and do not disrupt the armor’s design. For example, any shell or tentacle motif on the leftmost figure’s shoulder should not appear oversized or misplaced.",
      "question": "Are the ocean creature motifs on the armor of the leftmost figure small, integrated, and positioned in a way that does not distort the armor’s form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining consistent lighting direction from the sunset behind the figures, this question checks whether the shadows cast by the figures onto the rocks align with the sun’s position and whether the silhouettes are clean and uninterrupted.",
      "question": "Do the shadows of the figures fall forward onto the rocks in alignment with the sun’s position behind them, and are the silhouettes sharp and unbroken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
