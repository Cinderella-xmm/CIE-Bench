      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of stylizing the dress with intricate golden batik patterns and vibrant reds to emphasize cultural significance, this involves modifying the texture, color, and pattern of the dancer’s attire. The original image shows a richly detailed gold-orange dress with ornate textures. The editing must preserve fine details such as fabric folds, pattern continuity, and material realism while introducing new batik patterns. The question evaluates whether the added patterns appear seamlessly integrated without unnatural textures or breaks in material consistency.",
      "question": "Are the golden batik patterns on the dancer's dress clearly defined, continuous, and free from pixelation or jagged edges that suggest digital artifacts?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires simplifying the temple structure into detailed line-drawn illustrations in sepia tones. In the original image, the temple is a three-dimensional, multi-tiered structure with realistic stone textures and shadows. Converting it to a line-drawn style must maintain architectural accuracy and proportion while changing the visual style. This transformation risks distorting geometric shapes or losing structural coherence if not carefully executed. The question checks whether the simplified illustration retains correct proportions and avoids broken lines or misaligned tiers.",
      "question": "Does the line-drawn version of the temple maintain accurate tier alignment and structural symmetry without missing or distorted roof layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies composing the scene with the temple centered and mythical creatures symmetrically placed. In the original image, two large guardian statues flank the central path. Symmetry must be preserved in their positioning, size, and orientation. Any asymmetry or misalignment would break visual balance and reduce perceived authenticity. The question evaluates spatial composition and structural consistency between the two side elements.",
      "question": "Are the two guardian statues on either side of the pathway identical in size, pose, and position relative to the central temple axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The dancer’s hand gestures are critical for cultural authenticity in Balinese dance. The original image shows one hand raised and the other extended gracefully. Editing must ensure anatomical correctness—such as five fingers per hand, natural joint angles, and consistent skin tone and texture. Any distortion, extra fingers, or unnatural curvature would compromise realism. The question focuses on the physical plausibility of the hands in motion.",
      "question": "Do both of the dancer’s hands show five fingers each with natural spacing, smooth contours, and no deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for integrating informative text in elegant serif fonts about Balinese dance and architecture. While text is not visible in the original image, its addition must not interfere with existing visual elements. It should be legible, properly scaled, and positioned without overlapping key features like the dancer or temple. The question assesses whether the text placement respects visual hierarchy and does not obscure important content.",
      "question": "Is the text positioned in a way that does not overlap or obscure the dancer, temple, or guardian statues, and is it clearly readable without visual clutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
