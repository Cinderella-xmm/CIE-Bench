Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the towering structure (the large head statue) into a futuristic digital billboard installation. This involves replacing the current static, stone-like appearance with sleek, luminous panels and dynamic neon animations. The original image shows a massive robotic or cybernetic head mounted on a pedestal in an urban environment, with overgrowth at its base and surrounding industrial buildings. The transformation must preserve architectural angles but refine the surrounding buildings with metallic facades and augmented reality features. Key perceptual quality concerns include whether the new elements (neon panels, synthetic foliage) integrate naturally without introducing artifacts, distortions, or inconsistencies in material, lighting, or geometry. The core structure of the head must remain visually coherent despite the addition of digital components.

-Sub requirement 1: Replace the existing head structure with luminous digital panels while maintaining the original geometric shape and proportions; evaluate whether the new materials (e.g., glowing panels) appear physically plausible and consistent with the surrounding environment.
-Sub requirement 2: Introduce dynamic neon animations on the digital panels; assess whether these animations are rendered with smooth gradients and no pixelation or flickering artifacts that break realism.
-Sub requirement 3: Replace natural overgrowth at the base with synthetic glow-in-the-dark foliage; determine if the new vegetation maintains realistic texture, scale, and light emission without appearing unnaturally flat or distorted.
-Sub requirement 4: Refine surrounding buildings with contemporary metallic facades and AR features; check if these modifications maintain structural integrity and do not introduce warped surfaces or inconsistent reflections.
-Sub requirement 5: Preserve the overall architectural angles and spatial relationships between the head, pedestal, and background structures; ensure no geometric distortion occurs during the transformation.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement to replace the head structure with luminous digital panels while preserving original geometry, this question evaluates whether the new panel surfaces conform to the existing facial contours and structural lines of the head. It checks for unnatural breaks, misaligned edges, or mismatched normals that would suggest poor integration.
Question: Do the luminous panels follow the exact shape and curvature of the original headâ€™s surface without visible gaps or overlapping seams?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement to add dynamic neon animations, this question examines whether the animated elements (such as glowing lines or shifting colors) are rendered with consistent brightness, smooth transitions, and no jagged edges or aliasing that would indicate low-resolution or poorly integrated effects.
Question: Are the neon animations on the digital panels displayed with sharp, continuous light patterns and no pixelated or fragmented sections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement to replace natural overgrowth with synthetic glow-in-the-dark foliage, this question evaluates whether the new vegetation has a uniform yet natural distribution, emits light consistently from within, and does not appear as flat textures or unrealistic shapes.
Question: Does the synthetic foliage emit a soft, even glow from within, and do the individual plant forms have defined structure and depth without appearing like flat decals?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement to refine surrounding buildings with metallic facades and AR features, this question checks whether the new materials reflect light realistically, have consistent surface detail, and do not exhibit warping or stretching that would suggest deformation.
Question: Do the metallic surfaces of the surrounding buildings show accurate reflections and subtle surface variations without distorted grid patterns or stretched textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement to preserve architectural angles and spatial relationships, this question ensures that the transformed head and pedestal retain correct perspective alignment with the background structures, avoiding floating or misaligned components.
Question: Is the transformed head and pedestal aligned correctly with the horizon and surrounding buildings, showing no angular distortion or perspective mismatch?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
