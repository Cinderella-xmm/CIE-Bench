Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the ornate teapot into a luxury scented candle holder. This involves replacing the metallic body of the teapot with a glass container featuring intricate embossed patterns. The original teapot is highly detailed, made of reflective metal with ornate carvings and a domed lid. The transformation must preserve the overall shape and structural integrity while changing material properties from solid metal to transparent or translucent glass. This change affects perceived realism due to material shift—glass should reflect light differently than metal, and embossing must appear consistent with glass manufacturing techniques. Attention must be paid to whether the transition maintains geometric coherence and avoids unnatural textures or surface distortions.
-Sub requirement 1: Replace the teapot's body with a glass container that has embossed patterns; evaluate whether the new material (glass) appears natural in texture, transparency, and reflection, and whether the embossed patterns are seamlessly integrated without artifacts or distortion.

-<Thinking Process 2>: The lid of the teapot must be modified into a decorative finial-style candle snuffer. The original lid features a pointed finial and ornate cap. The transformation implies removing the functional spout and handle and replacing the top structure with a snuffer mechanism that retains aesthetic continuity with the original design. This modification must maintain visual balance and proportion, ensuring the new element does not appear disproportionately large or misaligned with the base container. Structural coherence is critical—any asymmetry or mismatch in scale could break visual credibility.
-Sub requirement 2: Modify the lid into a candle snuffer finial; assess whether the new structure maintains proportional alignment with the body, has natural form and symmetry, and avoids geometric distortion or floating elements.

-<Thinking Process 3>: The tablecloth, currently a white lace fabric draped over a round pedestal, must be replaced with a sleek marble base with a reflective surface. The original lace has delicate patterns and soft folds. Replacing it with marble changes both texture and material behavior—marble should have a smooth, polished appearance with subtle veining and reflective qualities. The transition must preserve the circular shape and support structure of the pedestal while eliminating any trace of lace fabric. Any residual textile texture or incomplete removal would compromise authenticity.
-Sub requirement 3: Replace the lace-covered pedestal with a marble base; evaluate whether the new surface exhibits natural marble veining, proper reflectivity, and seamless integration with the base geometry without visible seams or texture inconsistencies.

-<Thinking Process 4>: A small nameplate reading "Elegance Aroma" must be added to the side of the container. The placement must be physically plausible—attached at a natural height and angle on the glass body, not floating or overlapping incorrectly. The text must be legible, properly scaled, and rendered with realistic font depth and material finish (e.g., engraved or metallic plaque). Incorrect positioning, scaling, or text rendering could introduce artificiality.
-Sub requirement 4: Add a nameplate with the text "Elegance Aroma" on the side of the container; verify that the plate is correctly positioned, proportionally sized, and visually integrated without floating or clipping artifacts.

-<Thinking Process 5>: The entire transformation must preserve structural consistency across all elements—the glass body, snuffer finial, marble base, and nameplate must align spatially and materially. The lighting in the scene (diagonal shadow from upper left) should interact consistently with all surfaces—reflections, shadows, and highlights must match the expected behavior for glass, marble, and metal-like finishes. Any mismatch in lighting response (e.g., glass not reflecting surroundings) would reduce perceptual quality.
-Sub requirement 5: Ensure overall composition maintains consistent lighting interaction, material behavior, and spatial logic across all edited components, avoiding contradictions in reflections, shadows, or surface properties.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the teapot's body with a glass container featuring embossed patterns, this question evaluates whether the new material (glass) appears natural in terms of transparency, surface texture, and light interaction. The original metallic body had high reflectivity and sharp edges; the glass version must show appropriate refraction and subtle embossing without unnatural distortions such as warped patterns or inconsistent transparency.
Question: Does the glass container display natural transparency with visible embossed patterns that do not appear distorted or unnaturally stretched?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of modifying the lid into a decorative finial-style candle snuffer, this question checks whether the new top structure maintains proportional alignment and structural coherence with the body. The finial should extend naturally from the lid and not appear oversized, misaligned, or detached from the container’s silhouette.
Question: Is the candle snuffer finial proportionally aligned with the glass container and structurally connected without gaps or floating elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the lace-covered pedestal with a marble base, this question evaluates whether the new surface exhibits natural marble characteristics such as veining, polish, and reflectivity. The original lace had soft folds and texture; the marble must lack any residual textile pattern and instead show smooth, continuous stone texture with realistic light reflection.
Question: Does the marble base show consistent veining and reflective surface without any remnants of lace texture or unnatural seams?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a nameplate reading "Elegance Aroma" on the side of the container, this question assesses whether the label is correctly positioned, sized, and integrated into the scene. It must not float, clip through the container, or appear disproportionately large or small relative to the object.
Question: Is the nameplate attached to the side of the container at a natural height and angle, with no floating or clipping artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining consistent lighting and material behavior across all elements, this question evaluates whether reflections, shadows, and highlights on the glass, marble, and finial respond realistically to the directional light source. For example, the glass should reflect the environment and cast soft shadows, while the marble should reflect light smoothly without abrupt transitions.
Question: Do the reflections and shadows on the glass container, marble base, and finial align with the direction of the light source and exhibit consistent material behavior?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
