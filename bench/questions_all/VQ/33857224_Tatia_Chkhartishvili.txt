Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the woman into a cartoon-style keychain character with a big head, this involves significant stylization of facial proportions. The original image shows a realistically proportioned face and head relative to the body. The editing instruction requires exaggerating the head size while maintaining her distinctive red boots and lace dress. This transformation must preserve structural coherence between the oversized head and the rest of the body, ensuring that the transition from cartoon style to real elements (like the boots) does not introduce visual dissonance or distortion. The question evaluates whether the head scaling maintains plausible geometry without warping surrounding features.
Question: Is the head proportionally enlarged but still geometrically consistent with the neck and shoulders, without unnatural stretching or compression?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the character should be fashioned from soft rubber with bold black outlines. This implies a material change across the entire figure—especially noticeable in areas like the skin, clothing, and hair—which were originally textured and natural. The original image includes fine details such as fabric weave in the lace dress and natural hair strands. The conversion to a rubber-like texture must avoid losing these fine details while introducing a uniform, matte surface typical of rubber. This question checks if the texture transformation is applied consistently and without introducing artificial patterns or unnatural sheen.
Question: Are the surfaces of the body, dress, and hair uniformly rendered with a soft rubber texture, free from conflicting textures or glossy reflections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: The instruction requires retaining the red boots and lace dress as core elements. In the original image, the boots are clearly defined with visible brand labels and buckle details, and the dress has an open-knit pattern. These features must remain recognizable even after stylization. The question assesses whether the transformation preserves these identifying characteristics without distorting their shape or removing essential details such as the boot buckle or lacework.
Question: Are the red boots and lace dress clearly identifiable with preserved structural details such as buckles, stitching, and knit patterns?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The editing instruction calls for an exaggerated pose of bending over, which must be physically plausible within the cartoon style. The original image shows a realistic bend at the waist and knees. In the stylized version, the limbs and torso should maintain anatomical continuity despite the cartoon exaggeration. The question checks whether the limbs and spine follow a natural curve during the bend, avoiding joint distortions or floating limbs that break physical logic.
Question: Does the bent posture maintain anatomical alignment of the spine, hips, and knees without unnatural angles or floating segments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The instruction specifies attaching the character to a silver metal keyring against a neutral-toned wooden plank background. The original image features a dock and boat in the background. The new background must replace the scene entirely while preserving the wood grain texture and color consistency. The keyring must appear securely attached to the character’s body without clipping or misalignment. This question evaluates whether the keyring is properly integrated into the composition and whether the background wood planks are coherent and free from artifacts.
Question: Is the silver keyring visibly connected to the character without gaps or overlapping edges, and does the wooden plank background show consistent texture and spacing?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
