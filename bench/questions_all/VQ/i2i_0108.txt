Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the requirement to make the character appear as a 3D half-body figure breaking out from a television screen while maintaining overall authenticity and natural appearance, we must evaluate if the transition between the character and the screen introduces any unnatural artifacts or disrupts visual plausibility.
Question: Does the boundary where the character appears to break out of the television screen show no obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: To ensure the character's defensive shield-raising pose is visually credible and structurally consistent, it is important to assess if the positioning and angle of the shield match the character's posture naturally.
Question: Is the shield held in a manner that complements the character's posture without introducing distorted or broken geometric shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: The editing instruction aims to simulate an augmented reality display effect. The materials and lighting of the character should remain consistent with the environment to maintain a sense of reality.
Question: Are the lighting and reflections on the character's suit consistent with the environment, avoiding any loss of details or unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: To validate that the character’s transition into a 3D form maintains structural coherence and avoids distortion, it is necessary to inspect if the proportions of the character's visible body parts are realistic and undistorted.
Question: Do the visible parts of the character’s body maintain proper proportions, avoiding distortion or unnatural scaling?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Ensuring the overall authenticity and natural appearance involves checking if the added elements, like the part of the character breaking out of the screen, do not obstruct the continuity of other elements in the scene.
Question: Does the addition of the character breaking out of the screen maintain the visual continuity of the background and avoid disrupting other elements in the scene?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
