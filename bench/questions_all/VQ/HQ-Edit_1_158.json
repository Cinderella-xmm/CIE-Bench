      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"silhouetting the figure in an intricate paper-cut style\", evaluate whether the transformation of the woman’s silhouette maintains structural coherence and visual credibility. The original image shows a detailed, three-dimensional human figure with natural proportions and textures. Converting her into a paper-cut style must preserve anatomical accuracy (e.g., head shape, limbs, posture) while introducing stylized cut-out edges without distorting geometry or creating floating or disconnected parts. This affects overall realism and natural appearance.",
      "question": "Does the silhouette of the woman maintain correct anatomical proportions and avoid geometric distortions such as misaligned limbs, unnatural bends, or missing body parts?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"exaggerating the book's size for emphasis\", assess whether the scale change of the book adheres to physical plausibility and visual consistency. In the original image, the book is held naturally in both hands and fits within the context of the scene. Enlarging it may cause inconsistencies such as hands appearing too small, overlapping fingers improperly, or the book extending beyond the chair's boundaries in an unrealistic way. This impacts structural consistency and visual credibility.",
      "question": "Is the enlarged book proportionally consistent with the woman’s hands and arms, and does it not appear to float or clip through the chair or body?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding ornate lace details to the sweater\", determine whether the added texture appears natural and integrated with the existing fabric. The original sweater has a knit pattern; adding lace should not introduce unnatural textures like pixelation, repeating patterns that break continuity, or inconsistent thread thickness. It must follow the direction of the original garment and not create visual artifacts such as floating threads or mismatched material properties.",
      "question": "Are the lace details on the sweater seamlessly integrated with the original knit texture, showing no signs of unnatural edges, repeating patterns, or material inconsistencies?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"simplifying background bookshelves for focus with subtle texture\", evaluate whether the simplification preserves the spatial depth and structural integrity of the shelves. The original bookshelves have multiple levels, books, and objects (like teapots). Simplifying them should reduce clutter but retain recognizable shelf shapes, proper alignment, and plausible spacing. Over-simplification may result in broken lines, missing supports, or floating books, affecting visual credibility.",

The cardstock should show appropriate texture, color gradient, and lighting consistency with the rest of the image. It must not introduce sharp borders, unnatural shadows, or mismatched lighting that separates the scene from the base. This affects overall authenticity and perceived quality.",
