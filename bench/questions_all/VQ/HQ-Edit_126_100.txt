Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the house's columns into elaborate wooden legs, evaluate whether the structural transformation maintains geometric coherence and physical plausibility. The original image shows vertical support pillars under the elevated structure; these must now morph into leg-like forms that retain natural proportions and avoid unnatural bending or disproportionate scaling. This change affects structural consistency and visual credibility.
Question: Do the transformed columns resemble organic wooden legs with natural joint angles and proportional thickness, without visible distortion or broken geometry?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of morphing the straw roof into leafy branches, assess whether the texture and shape transition from thatch to foliage is seamless and visually plausible. The original roof has a layered thatch pattern; this must now appear as branching structures with leaves growing naturally from the apex, preserving continuity in material appearance and avoiding abrupt or artificial transitions.
Question: Does the roof area show a gradual transition from straw-like material to leafy branches with realistic leaf shapes, spacing, and lighting interaction, without jagged edges or unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the satellite dish into a giant lidless eye, evaluate whether the transformation preserves visual coherence and avoids surreal distortions. The original dish is a metallic parabolic structure; it must now appear as an organic eye with iris and pupil features, but still integrated into the treehouse form without violating spatial logic or introducing artificial highlights or artifacts.
Question: Is the satellite dish replaced by a large, detailed eye with a visible iris and pupil, positioned naturally on the side of the structure, without floating elements or mismatched shading?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of covering the walls with intricate bark patterns, assess whether the new surface texture mimics real tree bark with consistent grain, depth, and color variation. The original walls have woven bamboo panels; replacing them with bark should maintain textural realism and avoid flat or repetitive patterns that suggest digital cloning or artifacting.
Question: Are the wall surfaces covered with detailed bark patterns showing natural cracks, ridges, and color gradients, without repeating textures or uniformity indicating artificial generation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding orange blossoms radiating a soft aura, evaluate whether the flowers are integrated realistically with subtle glow effects. The original image already has orange flowers on the balcony; expanding them with luminous properties must not introduce harsh glows, pixelation, or floating light sources that break immersion.
Question: Do the orange blossoms emit a faint, diffused glow that blends with ambient lighting, without sharp halos or unnatural brightness that separates them from the surrounding environment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding whispering vines cascading from the structure, assess whether the vines grow naturally from the buildingâ€™s edges, following gravity and surface contours. They must appear as living plant matter with varying thickness and directionality, avoiding rigid lines or unnatural placement that breaks spatial logic.
Question: Do the vines emerge from multiple points on the structure, hang downward with natural curvature and density variation, and interact realistically with light and shadows?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
