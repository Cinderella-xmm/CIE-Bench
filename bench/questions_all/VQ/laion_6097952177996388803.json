      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving the geometric structure and proportions of the mountain peaks when transforming them into horns, this question evaluates whether the horn-like shapes maintain their original alignment and scale relative to the surrounding terrain. The peaks in the original image are symmetrical and sharply defined; any distortion would compromise structural consistency.",
      "question": "Do the transformed peaks retain their original height and angularity without appearing stretched, bent, or misaligned compared to the base of the mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying rocky surfaces to resemble textured hide, this question assesses whether the new texture appears natural and continuous across the rock faces, avoiding artificial repetition or unnatural surface irregularities. The original rock surfaces have layered striations and weathered features that should inform the texture design.",
      "question": "Are the textured hide patterns on the mountain slopes smooth and consistent with natural rock formations, without repeating tile-like patterns or sharp edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating mossy patterns and root-like structures along the slopes, this question checks whether these additions follow natural growth directions and blend with existing vegetation and soil. The original slopes show sparse grass and heather; new elements must grow from these areas realistically.",
      "question": "Do the mossy patches and root-like strands extend naturally from existing vegetation zones and follow downhill gradients without floating above the ground or forming unnatural clusters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing valleys with sinewy musculature shaped from natural contours, this question evaluates whether the new musculature follows the flow of the terrain and maintains plausible anatomical continuity. The original valley is a low-lying depression; the muscle structure should mimic this form without introducing bulges or gaps.",
      "question": "Does the sinewy musculature in the valley area follow the natural curve of the depression and connect smoothly to adjacent slopes without creating disjointed or exaggerated protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining a consistent earthy aura and natural color palette, this question examines whether the lighting and color tones remain harmonious across the scene. The original image has muted browns, grays, and whites under overcast skies; any enhancement should not introduce unnatural contrasts or saturation.",
      "question": "Are the colors of the transformed elements (hide, fur, musculature) within the same tonal range as the original landscape, with no sudden shifts in hue or brightness that disrupt visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving fine details such as erosion lines and grass tufts, this question checks whether small-scale features remain intact and logically positioned after editing. The original image contains visible erosion marks and individual plant clumps; these should not be erased or warped during transformation.",
      "question": "Are small-scale details like erosion lines, grass tufts, and rock crevices still visible and correctly aligned with the terrain, without blurring, duplication, or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
