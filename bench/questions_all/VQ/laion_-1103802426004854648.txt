Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the pink fabric with smooth, translucent pink glass showcasing subtle bubble texture, evaluate whether the material transformation at the seahorse’s body maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original plush texture must be replaced with a glass-like surface that has translucency and internal bubble patterns without introducing unnatural textures or distortions in shape.
Question: Does the body of the seahorse exhibit a consistent translucent pink glass appearance with visible subtle bubble textures, and are there no areas where the texture appears jagged, inconsistent, or artificially applied?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the yellow belly into opaque yellow glass with an etched music note, assess whether the material change preserves geometric integrity and detail fidelity. The original soft yellow plastic belly must now appear as solid, non-transparent glass with a clearly defined etched musical symbol within a heart shape.
Question: Is the yellow belly rendered as a smooth, opaque glass surface with a precisely etched music note inside a heart, and are the edges of the symbol clean without blurring or deformation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the purple ribbons on the fins and head with lavender glass ribbons, determine if the material substitution maintains realism and structural consistency. The original satin ribbons must be transformed into glass versions that retain their shape but now appear rigid and reflective like glass, not fabric.
Question: Are the ribbons on the head and fins rendered as solid lavender glass with smooth surfaces and light reflections, and do they maintain their original shape without warping or appearing stretched or flattened?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the seahorse on a reflective black display stand to enhance elegance, evaluate whether the addition of the stand introduces any visual inconsistencies or artifacts. The stand must appear physically plausible, with proper reflection of the seahorse and surrounding environment, and must not float or clip into the object.
Question: Is the seahorse positioned on a flat, reflective black surface that shows clear mirror-like reflections of its base and lower body, and is the stand seamlessly integrated without gaps or floating effects?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining overall authenticity and natural appearance during material transformations, assess whether the entire composition retains visual credibility. This includes checking for continuity between materials (e.g., glass-to-glass transitions), absence of seams, unnatural lighting, or shadows that contradict the new materials.
Question: Are all elements—body, belly, fins, ribbons, and base—visually consistent in lighting, shadow, and material properties, with no mismatched highlights, color shifts, or artificial edges suggesting poor blending?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
