Q1:  
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of designing the zebra as a childrenâ€™s cartoon zebra toy while retaining stripes and upright ears, consider if the transformation affects the overall realism and natural appearance. Specifically, assess the authenticity of the stripe pattern retention on the zebra.
Question: Are the stripes on the zebra consistent with its natural patterns without appearing as unnatural or disjointed lines?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q2:  
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement to ensure structural consistency and visual credibility, evaluate the authenticity of the zebra's upright ears after being designed as a cartoon toy. The zebra's ear structure should remain logical and undistorted.
Question: Do the zebra's ears maintain their natural upright position without any distortion or unnatural bending?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q3:  
Thinking process: Based on the need to retain core elements ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility, check the authenticity of the zebra's body proportions after transitioning into a cartoon toy design. Ensure there are no irregularities like disproportionate limbs or body parts.
Question: Does the zebra maintain realistic proportions in its limbs and body, avoiding any grossly exaggerated or distorted features?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q4:  
Thinking process: To reflect the absence of obvious artifacts and preservation of fine details, analyze the texture of the zebra's coat post-editing. Ensure there are no unnatural textures introduced during the transition to a cartoon style.
Question: Is the texture of the zebra's coat smooth and free of unnatural artifacts or pixelation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q5:  
Thinking process: Considering the overall realism and natural appearance requirement, inspect the surrounding grass area to confirm that there are no unintended edits or artifacts in non-target areas. This ensures the editing is focused solely on the zebra and does not disrupt the background.
Question: Is the grass around the zebra unaltered and free of any editing artifacts, maintaining its natural appearance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
