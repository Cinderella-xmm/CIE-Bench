      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the figure into a half-cartoon style with an elongated book, evaluate whether the character’s facial features and proportions remain structurally coherent and visually plausible after stylization. The original image shows a realistic human face with natural proportions; any cartoon-style modification must preserve anatomical accuracy (e.g., eye shape, nose, jawline) while introducing stylistic exaggeration without distorting geometry or creating unnatural contours.",
      "question": "Does the character’s face retain natural proportions and smooth contours despite the half-cartoon style transformation, without visible distortion in facial structure?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to elongate the book, assess whether the physical dimensions and shape of the open book on the desk are consistent with real-world object behavior. The original image shows a standard-sized book; elongation should not violate geometric plausibility (e.g., uneven pages, warped spine, inconsistent thickness), and the texture of the paper and binding must remain coherent.",
      "question": "Is the elongated book's shape geometrically consistent with a real book, maintaining uniform page thickness and aligned edges without warping or stretching artifacts?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to turn the sleeves into soft drapery, evaluate whether the fabric folds and shadows on the sleeves appear physically plausible and naturally draped. The original image shows structured sleeves with defined seams; converting them to soft drapery requires realistic light interaction, fold depth, and material texture that do not introduce unnatural creases or floating fabric.",
      "question": "Do the sleeves exhibit natural fabric draping with consistent lighting, shadow depth, and fold patterns that align with gravity and textile behavior?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to detail the buttons with golden filigree, assess whether the added decorative elements on the buttons are seamlessly integrated into the existing material of the vest. The original image shows simple wooden or dark buttons; adding intricate gold filigree must maintain material coherence—no pixelation, misalignment, or unnatural shine—and must not disrupt the surrounding fabric texture.",
      "question": "Are the golden filigree details on the buttons clearly rendered and integrated into the button surface without visible artifacts, such as jagged edges or mismatched reflections?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to present the library shelves as a wooden frame background, evaluate whether the shelving structure maintains structural consistency and visual credibility. The original image shows tall, continuous bookshelves; reinterpreting them as a framed background must preserve linear alignment, depth perspective, and material texture without breaking continuity or introducing false edges or gaps.",
      "question": "Are the library shelves transformed into a wooden frame background with consistent wood grain, edge alignment, and depth cues that maintain spatial logic and avoid broken geometry?",
