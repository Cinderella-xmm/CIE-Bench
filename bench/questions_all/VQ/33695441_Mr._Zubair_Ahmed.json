      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the white marble steps into segmented scales, this question evaluates whether the texture and shape of the steps have been altered into scale-like segments while preserving the spiral geometry. The original steps are uniform and flat; any deviation must be assessed for naturalness and structural integrity. The focus is on whether the transition from step to scale maintains continuous curvature and avoids gaps or overlaps that would indicate poor integration.",
      "question": "Do the steps now display a series of uniformly sized, overlapping scale-like segments that follow the spiral path without visible gaps or misalignment?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the wooden railing into a sinuous spine, this question assesses whether the railing has evolved into a continuous, anatomically plausible spine structure. The original railing is a smooth curve with vertical balusters; the edited version must maintain this curve but transform it into a bony or ribbed spine. The key is whether the spine appears structurally coherent, with no sudden kinks or unnatural bends that would suggest digital distortion.",
      "question": "Does the railing now form a continuous, gently curving spine-like structure with consistent thickness and no abrupt changes in direction or width?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding wooden patterns for a skeletal finish, this question checks whether the new skeletal textures match the original wood’s color and grain. The original railing has a dark brown, polished wood appearance; any added skeletal patterns must integrate seamlessly without appearing as superimposed or mismatched layers. The goal is to ensure material authenticity and visual continuity.",
      "question": "Are the wooden patterns applied to the spine consistent in tone, grain, and texture with the original railing, and do they appear as an integral part of the structure rather than a separate overlay?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of introducing stone-like ridges along the body, this question evaluates whether these ridges follow the spiral curve naturally and are anchored to the body without floating or breaking the surface continuity. The ridges must appear as if grown from the serpent’s back, not pasted on. Their placement must respect the depth and curvature of the spiral.",
      "question": "Are the stone-like ridges aligned along the outer edge of the spiral coils and smoothly integrated into the surface, without appearing detached or misaligned with the underlying form?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining proportional scaling and smooth curvature in each spiral coil, this question examines whether the coils taper correctly toward the center and maintain consistent spacing and curvature. A realistic serpent coil should not collapse inward unnaturally or stretch outward disproportionately. The central void should remain a coherent focal point.",
      "question": "Do the spiral coils decrease in size proportionally toward the center, maintaining smooth curvature and even spacing without compression or stretching that distorts the spiral shape?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving lighting consistency, this question checks whether shadows and highlights on the transformed surfaces follow the new topography logically. For example, if scales are added, light should fall on their raised edges; if ridges exist, they should cast subtle shadows. Inconsistent lighting suggests post-processing artifacts.",
      "question": "Do shadows and highlights on the scales, spine, and ridges follow the contours of the new surface structure, matching the direction and intensity of ambient light from above?",

      "question": "Are the edges of the scale segments, spinal bones, and stone ridges clearly defined and free from blurring, aliasing, or stair-stepping artifacts?",
