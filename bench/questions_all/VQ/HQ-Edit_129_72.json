      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the cardinal’s red feathers with iridescent scales, this evaluates whether the new material appears visually coherent across the bird’s body. The scales should follow the contour of the feathers, show subtle reflections, and avoid patchy or unnatural transitions. This affects the perceived authenticity of the transformed creature.",
      "question": "Do the iridescent scales cover the cardinal’s body smoothly without visible seams, pixelation, or inconsistent color gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding flickering flames at the wingtips and tail, this assesses whether the fire elements are properly anchored to the extremities and exhibit natural flame behavior (e.g., upward flow, soft edges). It checks for artifacts like sharp cutoffs, misplaced glow, or incorrect directionality.",
      "question": "Are the flames emerging from the wingtips and tail oriented upward and shaped naturally, without abrupt edges or disconnected fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the cardinal’s eyes to glowing embers, this examines whether the replacement preserves the eye’s position and shape while introducing a luminous effect. The glow should be contained within the eye socket and not spill unnaturally onto adjacent feathers.",
      "question": "Is the glowing ember effect confined to the eye area, with no halo bleed onto the surrounding feathers or face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the branch into twisted obsidian, this evaluates whether the material change maintains the original branch’s structure and proportions. Obsidian should appear dark, reflective, and solid, with no unnatural warping or loss of detail.",
      "question": "Does the obsidian branch retain the original branch’s branching pattern and thickness, with a smooth, glassy surface free of cracks or texture inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing blossoms with burning ones, this checks whether the flames are attached to the flower structures and behave plausibly (e.g., rising from petals). It ensures no floating flame particles or broken flower geometry.",
      "question": "Are the flames on the blossoms directly connected to the petals, with no detached or floating flame elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining visual coherence between fire and snow, this evaluates whether the interaction between burning elements and snowflakes is plausible. Snow should not melt visibly near flames unless indicated by subtle changes in particle density or light reflection.",
      "question": "Are the snowflakes falling around the flaming elements evenly distributed, with no unnatural absence or clustering near the fire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
