      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the grand piano's lid into a compact mirror case, evaluate whether the shape and material of the lid have been realistically altered to resemble a luxury cosmetics compact. The original lid is curved and reflective, so the transformation must maintain geometric coherence and surface texture consistency with high-end cosmetic packaging. Check if the new form retains structural integrity and avoids unnatural edges or distortions.",
      "question": "Does the transformed lid appear as a smooth, symmetrical compact mirror case with consistent glossy black finish and no visible geometric distortions or jagged edges?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the keyboard with a palette of eyeshadows, assess whether the area where the keys were located now displays a realistic eyeshadow palette. The original keyboard has precise white and black keys arranged in a regular pattern; replacing it requires maintaining proportional alignment and depth cues while introducing textured pans of pigment. Evaluate whether the transition from keys to palette maintains visual plausibility and avoids abrupt texture mismatches.",
      "question": "Is the keyboard area replaced with a palette of eyeshadows that shows distinct color pans with natural shading and reflection, without blending artifacts or misaligned geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying glossy black textures across the entire piano body to reflect luxury cosmetics packaging, examine whether the surface finish of the piano (including legs, frame, and side panels) uniformly exhibits a high-gloss, reflective texture consistent with premium cosmetic materials. The original piano has a polished black surface, so the enhancement should not introduce inconsistent sheen or matte patches.",
      "question": "Are all surfaces of the piano uniformly coated in a glossy black material that reflects light consistently and shows no areas of uneven texture or matte regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a refined logo and slogan on the piano’s body, check the location typically used for branding—such as the side panel near the keyboard or the fallboard. The original image shows a brand name (\"SCHIMMEL\") faintly visible on the fallboard. The new logo must be seamlessly integrated without distorting nearby elements or appearing pixelated or poorly aligned. Assess whether the text is legible, proportionally scaled, and stylistically consistent with luxury branding.",
      "question": "Is the added logo and slogan positioned clearly on the piano’s body, with sharp, non-blurry typography and proper alignment to surrounding surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of positioning the product in an elegant marble hall, verify that the environment remains structurally coherent and visually plausible. The original image features a modern architectural space with vertical columns and tiled flooring. The editing must preserve spatial logic—no floating elements, distorted perspective, or mismatched lighting. Confirm that shadows, reflections, and material continuity between the piano and surroundings remain consistent.",
      "question": "Do the piano and its surroundings exhibit consistent lighting, shadow direction, and material interaction, with no floating objects or perspective distortion in the hallway setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
