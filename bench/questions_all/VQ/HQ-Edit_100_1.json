    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"miniaturization of the tree must preserve its natural shape and texture,\" evaluate whether the scaled-down tree retains proportional branching, realistic bark texture, and natural leaf distribution without appearing compressed or stretched. Check for any distortion in the trunk or limbs that would compromise structural consistency.",
      "question": "Does the tree in the edited image maintain natural branch proportions and trunk thickness relative to the surrounding elements, without appearing unnaturally shrunk or warped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"enhanced 3D texture on the tree should not introduce artificial patterns or inconsistent lighting,\" assess whether the surface of the tree shows realistic depth cues such as subtle shading and texture variation, without exaggerated relief or synthetic-looking highlights.",
      "question": "Are the textures on the tree's bark and leaves consistent with natural materials, showing no signs of digital over-enhancement such as repeating patterns or unnatural gloss?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"multi-colored flower patches beneath the tree must be evenly distributed and consistent,\" examine the lower portion of the image where flowers are present. Ensure that new flower clusters are integrated smoothly without abrupt color transitions, pixelation, or unnatural density that suggests artificial placement.",
      "question": "Are the flower patches beneath the tree uniformly distributed and blended into the existing meadow, without visible cloning artifacts, sharp edges, or color inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"layered painted backdrops must simulate depth without visible seams,\" evaluate the background behind the tree and horizon line. Look for any horizontal lines, color discontinuities, or flat areas that suggest separate painted layers were poorly merged.",
      "question": "Is the background behind the tree seamlessly blended, with no visible layering lines, color jumps, or flat regions that break the illusion of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"tiny cloud figures suspended from thin wires must appear physically plausible,\" inspect the upper part of the scene for suspended clouds. Check if they are connected by thin, unobtrusive wires, positioned above the landscape without intersecting other elements, and rendered with soft edges and translucency.",
      "question": "Are the cloud figures positioned above the scene on thin, non-visible wires, appearing small and light enough to suggest suspension, without overlapping or intersecting with the tree or ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"wooden shadow box frame must be visible and structurally coherent,\" verify whether the frame is present around the image, with defined edges, wood grain texture, and proper shadowing that suggests a physical enclosure. Ensure it does not float or clip incorrectly with internal elements.",
      "question": "Is the wooden frame clearly visible around the scene with consistent material appearance, straight edges, and proper shadowing that indicates a three-dimensional box structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
