Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility without introducing distortions such as unnatural textures or degraded fine details", judge whether the transition from the ceiling fan to a snow globe maintains structural consistency and avoids unnatural artifacts.
Question: Does the transition from the ceiling fan to the snow globe maintain structural coherence without any visible distortion or unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of "avoiding the introduction of artifacts such as unnatural textures and loss of details", evaluate if the interior of the snow globe retains the fine details of the fan while adopting a playful, cartoon-style 3D design.
Question: Are the fine details of the fan preserved within the snow globe's interior, avoiding any loss of detail or unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of "ensuring the maintained style, materials, and other features reflect the overall sense of reality and natural appearance", assess if the exterior setting with soft lighting and a warm background complements the snow globe scene naturally.
Question: Does the exterior setting with soft lighting and a warm background complement the snow globe scene naturally, enhancing the overall realism and natural appearance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the sub requirement of "whether the proportion and physical rationality of each element avoid distortion such as damaged geometric shapes", check if the proportions of the snow globe and its contents are physically plausible and free from distortion.
Question: Are the proportions of the snow globe and its contents physically plausible, with no distorted or broken geometric shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "evaluating whether the output maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility", determine if the light passing through the globe creates believable shimmering effects on nearby surfaces without disrupting the scene's authenticity.
Question: Does the light passing through the snow globe create delicate shimmering effects on nearby surfaces that appear authentic and do not disrupt the scene's overall authenticity?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
