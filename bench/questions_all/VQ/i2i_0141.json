      "thinking_process": "Reflecting on the requirement of avoiding artifacts and preserving structural coherence during the transformation, it is crucial to assess if the crystal silhouettes blend seamlessly with the existing background and bench without disrupting the scene's visual plausibility.",
      "question": "Do the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs integrate naturally with the background and the bench, without creating visible breaks or distortions?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the need to preserve the core elements' structural consistency and visual credibility, it is important to ensure that the transformation does not result in disproportionate or physically unrealistic shapes within the silhouettes.",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs realistic and consistent with human anatomy, avoiding exaggerated or distorted forms?",

      "thinking_process": "The goal of maintaining the style and materials' sense of reality involves ensuring that the new crystal material appears convincingly three-dimensional and transparent, without clashing with the surrounding environment.",
      "question": "Does the crystal material used for the silhouettes of the couple's backs appear three-dimensional and transparent, contributing to the overall natural appearance?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Keeping the visual credibility and authenticity in mind, it is necessary to check if the transformation retains the spatial coherence, meaning the crystal silhouettes should still give the impression that the couple is seated properly on the bench.",
      "question": "Do the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs still convey the impression that the couple is seated naturally on the bench, maintaining spatial coherence?",
