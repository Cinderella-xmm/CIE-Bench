      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the woman into a ceramic doll, the facial features must remain anatomically accurate despite material change. The original image shows a clear face with natural proportions; the edited version must preserve this structure while converting to porcelain-like texture. The question evaluates whether the facial shape, eyes, nose, and mouth retain correct alignment and symmetry without distortion.",
      "question": "Does the figurineâ€™s face maintain correct anatomical proportions with no visible warping or misshapen features?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering the gown in soft pastel blue porcelain with silver floral details, the fabric folds must now appear as glazed ceramic with consistent sheen and defined contours. The original gown has flowing folds; the edited version must preserve their shape but with a reflective, smooth surface. This question checks for unnatural textures or broken lines in the material transition.",
      "question": "Are the folds of the dress rendered with smooth, continuous surfaces resembling glazed porcelain, without cracked or fragmented areas?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of positioning the figurine leaning against a miniature ornate column, the hand placement and column interaction must be physically plausible. The original image shows the hand resting naturally on the column; the edited version must maintain this pose with proper contact and shadowing. This question assesses structural consistency and realism of the hand-column interface.",
      "question": "Is the hand positioned correctly on the column with natural contact and no floating or clipped fingers?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the mantle and column to have a glossy, miniature appearance, the surfaces must reflect light appropriately and show scaled-down ornamentation. The original mantle has detailed carvings; the edited version must retain these in reduced size and with a polished finish. This question evaluates whether the surface details are preserved and proportionally correct.",
      "question": "Do the decorative patterns on the mantle and column appear clearly defined and scaled down appropriately for a miniature setting?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a base painted to mimic a vintage parlor setting, the base must integrate seamlessly with the figurine and environment. It should not appear detached or misaligned. The original background includes dark furniture and a mirror; the base must suggest depth and continuity without visual breaks. This question checks for compositional coherence and absence of artifacts.",
      "question": "Is the base of the figurine aligned with the surrounding elements and does it display consistent lighting and perspective with the rest of the scene?",
