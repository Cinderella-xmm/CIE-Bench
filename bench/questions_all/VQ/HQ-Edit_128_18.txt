Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding vibrant green foliage motifs around the plush giraffe, evaluate whether the newly added foliage elements maintain natural textures and shapes consistent with real plant structures. The editing position is around the base and sides of the giraffe, where the foliage should appear as if growing naturally without clumping or unnatural overlaps. The material must reflect realistic leaf patterns and lighting interactions.
Question: Are the green foliage motifs surrounding the giraffe composed of smooth, organically shaped leaves with consistent shading and no jagged edges or pixelation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of incorporating animal footprints along the floor, assess whether the footprints are proportionally accurate and physically plausible in relation to the size of the toys and the room. The editing position is on the wooden floor near the rug and extending toward the wall. The footprints should not overlap unrealistically or distort the floor texture.
Question: Do the animal footprints on the floor follow a logical path from the giraffe toward the edge of the room, with consistent depth and spacing that matches typical animal gait patterns?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of wrapping the plush toys in clear packaging with branded tags, evaluate whether the transparent packaging appears physically accurate—such as having proper reflections, refraction, and slight distortion of underlying toy shapes. The editing position includes all plush toys (bear, elephant, lion, etc.) on the rug. Packaging should not introduce unnatural warping or floating effects.
Question: Is the clear packaging around each plush toy transparent with visible surface highlights and subtle distortion of the toy’s shape beneath, consistent with real plastic wrap?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using playful, colorful typography on the walls, assess whether the text elements are legible, stylistically coherent, and integrated into the wall without breaking its surface continuity. The editing position is on the wall above the shelf and near the cloud decals. The typography must not appear as floating or misaligned pixels.
Question: Are the colorful letters on the wall aligned properly with the wall surface, showing no gaps, blurring, or inconsistent font scaling?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the plush giraffe as the centerpiece while transforming the scene into an illustrated jungle, evaluate whether the giraffe's proportions remain anatomically consistent and whether its texture and color blend naturally with the new environment. The editing position is the giraffe itself, which should not show any deformation or texture discontinuity due to added elements.
Question: Does the giraffe retain its original body proportions and soft fabric texture, with no stretching, flattening, or unnatural seams introduced during the transformation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
