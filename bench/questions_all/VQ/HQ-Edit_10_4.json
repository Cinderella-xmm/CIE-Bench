      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the subject into an ancient African sculpture crafted from dark wood, evaluate whether the skin and facial features have been realistically converted to a carved wooden texture while preserving anatomical proportions. The original image shows a human face with smooth skin; the edit must replace this with wood-like material without distorting facial structure or introducing unnatural surface irregularities.",
      "question": "Does the facial area exhibit a consistent dark wood texture with natural grain patterns, maintaining accurate facial proportions and avoiding distortions such as warped features or inconsistent surface depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of portraying the vibrant attire as intricately carved patterns, assess whether the clothing has been transformed into detailed low-relief carvings that retain the original design's complexity and color relationships. The original garment features richly patterned fabric with multiple colors and geometric motifs; these must now appear as carved wooden reliefs with painted details.",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the clothing rendered as deeply incised carvings with visible relief depth, and do they preserve the original arrangement of colors and shapes without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of highlighting the beaded crown and earrings in painted colorful detail, determine whether the beads and jewelry have been preserved as distinct, colorful elements on the wooden surface. The original image shows multicolored beads arranged in intricate bands around the head and large circular earrings; these should remain visually distinct and not blend into the wood texture.",
      "question": "Are the beads on the crown and earrings clearly defined with vibrant, non-blended colors, appearing as painted details on the wooden surface rather than merged or distorted textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of interpreting the lush background as low-relief carvings, evaluate whether the foliage and landscape behind the figure have been transformed into sculpted relief forms with appropriate depth and texture. The original background is a painted jungle scene with layered vegetation; it must now appear as carved wood with dimensional layers.",
      "question": "Is the background composed of low-relief carved plant forms that maintain spatial depth and botanical structure, without flattening or losing the sense of layered vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of emulating traditional African art with deeply incised motifs and a polished finish, assess whether the overall surface of the sculpture exhibits a uniform, polished appearance with no visible digital artifacts such as jagged edges, pixelation, or unnatural gloss. The transformation must preserve fine details like hair strands and beadwork within the wooden medium.",
      "question": "Does the entire sculpture surface display a consistent polished finish with no visible rendering artifacts, such as edge halos, texture repetition, or missing fine details in the hair, beads, or clothing carvings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
