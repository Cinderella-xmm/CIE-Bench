The original coat is proportionally accurate; any exaggeration must not break physical logic.",
      "question": "Does the child's coat maintain a coherent shape with natural folds and no distorted or broken seams?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the balloons' colors to pastel tones, this question checks whether the color shift results in visible artifacts such as uneven gradients, haloing around edges, or loss of surface detail (e.g., reflections or highlights). The original balloons have glossy, reflective surfaces; pastelization must preserve these qualities.",
      "question": "Are the balloon surfaces evenly colored in pastel tones without visible color bleeding or loss of specular highlights?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of cartoonizing the child’s features, this question examines whether the hand structure remains anatomically correct—specifically, whether the number of fingers is five and the shape follows ergonomic principles. Any distortion here would compromise structural consistency.",
      "question": "Does the child’s right hand holding the balloons have exactly five fingers with natural joint alignment and no extra or missing digits?",

      "question": "Is the watercolor texture applied uniformly across the wheat field without disrupting the visibility of individual stalks or creating unnatural stroke lines?",
