Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction specifies creating a miniature 3D Paris scene with two Eiffel Towers inside a dual-tier snow globe. This involves significant structural and compositional changes to the original image, which currently shows a real-world Parisian landscape with one Eiffel Tower and a second identical tower added in an unrealistic manner. The instruction requires transforming this into a stylized, enclosed diorama-like scene with distinct upper and lower tiers, metallic antique skyline, forested gardens, drifting silvery flakes, cobblestone base, and street lamps. These changes affect multiple elements: the Eiffel Towers’ placement, background cityscape, foreground garden layout, lighting, and overall spatial structure. The original image lacks any snow globe enclosure or tiered composition, so the editing must introduce new architectural and environmental layers while preserving plausible geometry and material consistency.

-Sub requirement 1: The addition of a dual-tier snow globe structure must maintain geometric coherence and visual plausibility, ensuring that the upper and lower tiers are proportionally balanced and physically consistent (e.g., no floating structures, correct perspective scaling).

-Sub requirement 2: The upper tier’s antique Paris skyline must feature metallic hues and intricate detailing without introducing unnatural textures or color mismatches with surrounding elements.

-Sub requirement 3: The lower tier’s forested gardens must display vibrant greenery with natural foliage shapes and density, avoiding artificial patterns or texture repetition.

-Sub requirement 4: Silvery flakes drifting between tiers must appear as soft, translucent particles with realistic motion blur and depth cues, not as static or pixelated artifacts.

-Sub requirement 5: The base of the snow globe must include detailed sculpted cobblestones and classic street lamps that align with the scale and style of the scene, maintaining structural integrity and material realism.

-Sub requirement 6: The two Eiffel Towers must be repositioned within the snow globe environment such that their proportions and structural details remain intact and consistent with each other and the surrounding architecture.

-Sub requirement 7: The overall scene must preserve visual credibility by avoiding distortions such as warped perspectives, inconsistent lighting, or abrupt transitions between materials.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining geometric coherence in the dual-tier snow globe structure, this question evaluates whether the upper and lower tiers are visually separated by a clear boundary and properly scaled relative to each other, ensuring no floating or misaligned elements. The presence of a transparent dome or enclosure should be implied through lighting and depth cues.
Question: Are the upper and lower tiers clearly defined with consistent perspective and proportional scaling, and is there a visible separation between them that suggests a layered structure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement for metallic hues in the upper-tier skyline, this question assesses whether the buildings exhibit reflective, metallic surfaces with appropriate shading and texture, avoiding flat or cartoonish appearances that would compromise realism.
Question: Do the buildings in the upper tier have a metallic sheen with subtle reflections and gradients that match the lighting direction, and are there no flat or unnaturally uniform color patches?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement for natural-looking forested gardens in the lower tier, this question checks whether the trees and shrubs have organic shapes, varied sizes, and realistic leaf textures, avoiding repetitive patterns or blocky rendering typical of low-resolution or AI-generated vegetation.
Question: Are the trees and bushes in the lower tier composed of irregular, naturally shaped forms with varying heights and densities, and do they lack repeating texture tiles or unnatural symmetry?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement for silvery flakes drifting between tiers, this question examines whether the particles appear as soft, semi-transparent elements with motion blur and depth variation, rather than sharp, static dots or jagged lines that suggest digital artifacts.
Question: Are the silvery flakes distributed across the space between tiers with soft edges, slight blurring, and depth-based opacity, indicating movement through air?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement for detailed cobblestone base and street lamps, this question evaluates whether the base features individual stone blocks with realistic texture and wear, and whether the street lamps have consistent design and proper scale relative to the scene.
Question: Does the base show individually rendered cobblestones with visible grout lines and surface variations, and are the street lamps proportionally sized and evenly spaced along the path?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement for structural consistency of the Eiffel Towers within the snow globe, this question checks whether both towers retain accurate architectural details, correct proportions, and symmetrical alignment, avoiding distortion or stretching that would break visual credibility.
Question: Are both Eiffel Towers structurally intact with correct lattice patterns, uniform scaling, and no stretched or compressed sections that deviate from their known design?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
