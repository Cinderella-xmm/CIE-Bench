      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the octopus into a stylized vintage 1950s aesthetic with flattened pastel tones, evaluate whether the color modification of the octopus maintains natural appearance while adhering to the retro style. The editing involves changing the original realistic purple and pink hues to pastel versions, which must not introduce unnatural color transitions or patches that break visual coherence.",
      "question": "Are the pastel colors applied to the octopus uniformly distributed without abrupt color shifts or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding bold brush outlines around the octopus for a vintage cartoon effect, assess whether these outlines are cleanly applied and do not distort the underlying anatomy or create floating lines. The outline should follow the contours of the tentacles and head accurately, preserving structural integrity.",
      "question": "Do the brush outlines around the octopus follow the natural curves of its body and tentacles without overlapping or breaking at joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the beach into a playful paradise scene, examine whether the sand, water, and horizon have been altered to reflect whimsical elements (e.g., exaggerated waves, bright foliage) while maintaining plausible physical properties such as wave behavior and light reflection.",
      "question": "Are the waves near the shore smooth and consistent in shape, showing natural foam patterns without jagged or broken textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding whimsical text \"Escape to Adventure at Tentacle Shores\" in a curvy retro font across the top, evaluate whether the text is legible, properly aligned, and integrated into the sky without disrupting cloud formations or creating visual artifacts like blurring or clipping.",
      "question": "Is the text positioned above the horizon line without intersecting clouds or causing visible distortion in the background sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of stylizing the entire scene in a vintage 1950s aesthetic, check whether the lighting and shadows remain consistent with the time of day depicted (sunset) and whether the added stylistic elements (such as flat colors and outlines) preserve spatial depth and avoid flattening the scene unnaturally.",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the octopus and surrounding terrain align with the direction of the sunset light source and maintain depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
