Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction requires transforming the wooden patio furniture into large LEGO block structures using brown and amber bricks. This involves replacing the entire material and structure of the table and chairs, which are currently made of natural wood with visible grain and slatted construction. The transformation must preserve the original shape and spatial layout but replace textures, materials, and surface details to resemble interlocking LEGO bricks. This change significantly affects perceived realism and natural appearance because it shifts from organic wood to artificial plastic-like blocks. Attention must be paid to whether the new LEGO-style surfaces maintain geometric consistency, avoid unnatural textures, and retain structural coherence with the original arrangement.
-Sub requirement 1: Replace the wooden table and chairs with LEGO-style block structures using brown and amber bricks, ensuring that the overall shape and spatial layout remain consistent with the original furniture.
-Sub requirement 2: Ensure that the tabletop and seating surfaces feature interlocking LEGO brick patterns, maintaining visual plausibility and avoiding broken or misaligned brick edges.
-Sub requirement 3: Add LEGO plant elements in the center of the table, replacing the existing glass bowl with decorative stones—ensuring these plants resemble standard LEGO plant pieces (e.g., green stems, leaf shapes) and are proportionally scaled to fit the scene.
-Sub requirement 4: Place the entire set on a simplified gray LEGO baseplate, which should cover only the area beneath the furniture and not extend beyond it, while leaving the surrounding environment uncluttered—meaning no changes to the background fence, grass, or potted plants.
-Sub requirement 5: Avoid introducing artifacts such as jagged edges, mismatched brick seams, unnatural lighting reflections, or texture inconsistencies that would break the illusion of a LEGO model.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the wooden table and chairs with LEGO-style block structures, this question evaluates whether the transformation maintains structural coherence by preserving the original rectangular shape and chair positions. It checks if the LEGO bricks form continuous, aligned surfaces without gaps or distortions in geometry.
Question: Are the table and chairs composed of uniformly sized brown and amber LEGO bricks with clean, interlocking edges and no visible breaks or misalignments in their surfaces?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of creating interlocking surfaces for the tabletop and seating, this question assesses whether the LEGO brick pattern is consistent across all surfaces and follows realistic LEGO construction principles (e.g., alternating stud patterns). It ensures that the texture does not appear stretched or fragmented.
Question: Do the tabletop and chair seats display a consistent LEGO brick texture with repeating stud patterns and no unnatural stretching or distortion of individual bricks?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding LEGO plant elements in the center, this question checks whether the replacement object (originally a glass bowl with stones) has been replaced with LEGO-compatible plant pieces that match typical LEGO design (e.g., green stems, flat leaves) and are properly scaled relative to the table.
Question: Is the central element on the table a LEGO-style plant made of green bricks with recognizable leaf shapes, and is it positioned centrally without overlapping or floating above the surface?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the set on a simplified gray LEGO baseplate, this question evaluates whether the baseplate is present under the furniture, covers only the required area, and contrasts appropriately with the surrounding concrete patio without blending or extending unnaturally.
Question: Is the furniture placed on a flat, gray LEGO baseplate that fits snugly beneath the table and chairs, with no overhang beyond the furniture edges and no visible seam between the baseplate and the real ground?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts such as unnatural textures or loss of detail, this question examines whether the transition from wood to LEGO introduces visual anomalies like ghosting, blurring, or inconsistent lighting that would suggest poor rendering quality.
Question: Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged edges, pixelation, or unnatural lighting shadows around the LEGO furniture that suggest incomplete rendering or poor integration with the background?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
