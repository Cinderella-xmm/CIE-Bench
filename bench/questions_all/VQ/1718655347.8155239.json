      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the moon’s surface to include golden thread patterns while preserving its circular form and reflective glow, this question evaluates whether the golden threads are applied smoothly and consistently across the moon’s surface without breaking its spherical shape or introducing pixelation or jagged edges.",
      "question": "Are the golden threads on the moon evenly distributed and seamlessly integrated into the circular shape without visible breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the natural mountain contours with interlocking geometric shapes, this question checks whether the new geometric forms maintain proper proportion and alignment with the original mountain range, avoiding fragmented or overlapping structures that defy geological logic.",
      "question": "Do the interlocking geometric shapes on the mountain peaks align properly with the original ridge lines and maintain consistent scale and depth without floating or disconnected segments?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the red trees into stylized embroidery patterns, this question examines whether the new patterns preserve the original tree silhouettes and spacing, and whether the embroidery texture appears uniform and free from unnatural stitching artifacts such as gaps or misaligned lines.",
      "question": "Are the embroidery patterns on the red trees aligned with their original positions and shapes, and do they display consistent thread density and direction without visible flaws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of depicting the water with silvery-blue silk strands, this question assesses whether the silk strands follow the natural flow of the river and lake, maintain continuity in texture, and reflect light in a way that mimics liquid surfaces rather than appearing stiff or static.",
      "question": "Do the silvery-blue silk strands follow the natural curvature of the water body and show smooth transitions between sections without abrupt changes in thickness or direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring all edited elements coexist within a cohesive mythical tapestry aesthetic, this question evaluates whether the integration of different stylized elements (moon, mountains, trees, water) maintains visual harmony, with no single element standing out due to mismatched style, lighting, or scale.",
      "question": "Do the golden-threaded moon, geometric mountains, embroidered trees, and silk-water all share a consistent artistic style and lighting response without creating visual dissonance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
