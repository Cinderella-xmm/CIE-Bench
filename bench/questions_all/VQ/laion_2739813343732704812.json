      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of exaggerating the beak and bulging eyes for comical charm, this involves modifying the pelican’s facial features. The original beak is long and curved with natural ridges; exaggeration must not cause it to bend unnaturally or extend beyond anatomical limits. Bulging eyes should not disrupt the eye socket structure or appear misaligned. This evaluates structural consistency and visual credibility of facial features.",
      "question": "Is the pelican's beak elongated but still attached naturally to the head without bending or breaking at the base?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using vivid pastels for feathers while maintaining original texture, this involves color and texture modification. The original feathers have layered, striated patterns. The edit must preserve these textures even with pastel coloring to avoid a flat or plastic-like appearance. This assesses material authenticity and detail retention.",
      "question": "Do the pelican’s feathers display visible layered texture despite being colored in pastel shades, without appearing uniformly smooth or pixelated?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a sailor hat atop the pelican’s head, this introduces a new object. The hat must sit properly on the head, matching the curvature and not clipping through the neck or floating above. It should also match the cartoon style in terms of shading and material.",
      "question": "Is the sailor hat positioned securely on the pelican’s head without overlapping the neck or appearing detached from the surface?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the grassy background with muted wooden planks, this involves background substitution. The new background must not show stitching lines, mismatched lighting, or abrupt transitions. It should support the nautical theme without distracting from the subject.",
      "question": "Does the wooden plank background extend evenly behind the pelican without visible seams or inconsistencies in wood grain or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence and avoiding distortion in limbs, the pelican’s legs and feet must remain proportionate and anatomically plausible even after stylization. The feet should not appear stretched or warped, and the leg joints should follow natural alignment.",
      "question": "Are the pelican’s legs and feet proportionally aligned with the body and not distorted or bent in an unnatural way?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of conveying a magnet-like appearance, the overall form should suggest flatness and rigidity. Shadows should be simplified or absent, and the edges should appear clean and defined, avoiding depth cues that contradict a flat object.",
      "question": "Does the pelican appear as a flat, two-dimensional object with minimal depth cues and clean edges, consistent with a magnet design?",
