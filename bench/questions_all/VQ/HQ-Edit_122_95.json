      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the saree into a Byzantine mosaic with peacock and vine patterns in tesserae, this involves replacing the original fabric texture with a highly stylized mosaic material. The editing position is the entire saree worn by both figures. This change affects material realism and surface texture. The question evaluates whether the new mosaic pattern maintains natural-looking tile placement, consistent scale, and seamless integration without visible pixelation or unnatural transitions.",
      "question": "Does the mosaic pattern on the saree maintain uniform tesserae size and alignment across the fabric, with no visible seams or distorted tiles?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reimagining the Taj Mahal as a domed basilica with arches leading to mythological scenes, the architectural structure in the background must be modified. The original white marble dome and minarets are replaced with a Byzantine-style domed basilica. This transformation impacts structural coherence and geometric plausibility. The question checks whether the new dome and arches retain proper proportions and symmetry without warped lines or impossible angles.",
      "question": "Are the arches and dome of the transformed building structurally coherent, with straight edges, consistent curvature, and no broken or misaligned geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the pose to a graceful ecclesiastical stance typical of solemn Byzantine figures, the body posture and hand positioning of both women must change. The original relaxed stance is replaced with a more rigid, formal pose. The hands should be positioned naturally within the context of religious iconography. This affects anatomical accuracy and ergonomics. The question evaluates whether the hand shape, number of fingers, and joint alignment conform to human anatomy.",
      "question": "Do both hands show five fingers each, with natural finger spacing and joint alignment, and no extra digits or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating floral motifs into the scene, additional decorative elements are added to the environment, possibly on the ground, walls, or surrounding structures. These motifs must be consistent with the Byzantine style and not disrupt spatial logic. The question assesses whether these added patterns appear seamlessly integrated, with appropriate scale and orientation relative to the architecture.",
      "question": "Are the floral motifs evenly distributed and proportionally sized relative to the surrounding architecture, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using a golden backdrop for the mosaic transformation, the background behind the figures and the entire scene may have been altered to a gold-colored surface. This affects lighting consistency and material believability. The question checks whether the golden surface shows realistic reflections, gradients, and depth, without flat or overly shiny areas that break visual credibility.",
      "question": "Does the golden backdrop exhibit smooth gradient transitions and subtle surface variations, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural shine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
