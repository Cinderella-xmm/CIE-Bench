      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the human figure into a vintage doll with articulated limbs, this question evaluates whether the limbs maintain anatomical consistency and proper joint articulation. The original image shows natural human limbs; the edited version must preserve functional limb proportions and avoid unnatural bending or elongation. The number of fingers should remain five per hand, and joints should align logically.",
      "question": "Do the arms and legs of the figure have clearly defined joints and correct proportions, with no missing or extra limbs, and do the hands each have exactly five fingers arranged naturally?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replicating the gown on the doll form, this question checks whether the fabric texture, pattern, and drape remain consistent with the original clothing. The original dress has a light blue skirt with stitched details and a patterned jacket. On the doll, the fabric should not appear stretched, wrinkled unnaturally, or lose detail.",
      "question": "Is the pattern on the jacket and the stitching on the skirt preserved and aligned correctly, with no distorted or repeated textures, and does the fabric drape naturally over the doll's form?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding lace around the collar, this question assesses whether the lace is seamlessly integrated into the garment. The lace should be thin, translucent, and properly attached along the collar edge without overlapping or floating.",
      "question": "Is the lace trim around the collar thin and evenly applied, with no visible gaps, misalignment, or unnatural shadows indicating poor integration?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of affixing a small velvet hat, this question evaluates whether the hat is proportionally correct, textured appropriately, and properly shaded. The hat should sit securely on the head without appearing detached or floating due to lighting errors.",
      "question": "Is the velvet hat properly sized relative to the head, with visible fabric texture and soft shadows that suggest it is resting on the head rather than floating above it?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of setting the scene in a miniature Victorian street, this question checks whether the background elements (cobblestones, gas lamps, carriages) are proportionally scaled to match the doll and exhibit realistic textures. The original background contains modern objects; these must be replaced without introducing digital artifacts or inconsistent scales.",
      "question": "Are the cobblestone ground, gas lamps, and horse-drawn carriages in the background proportionally smaller than the doll and rendered with consistent textures and lighting that match the scene?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying facial and bodily features to reflect a doll-like appearance, this question evaluates whether the face and skin texture appear consistent with a manufactured object. The skin should lack pores or natural imperfections, and the eyes may be simplified or painted. Joints should show articulation lines without deformation.",
      "question": "Does the face have simplified features typical of a doll (such as painted eyes and smooth skin), and do the limbs show clear joint lines or hinges without unnatural bending or stretching?",
