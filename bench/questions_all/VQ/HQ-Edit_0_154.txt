Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the wallet into a schematic blueprint with a minimalist style, evaluate whether the structural conversion maintains geometric integrity and visual coherence. The original wallet is a three-dimensional leather object with defined stitching, flap, and texture. The transformation to a blueprint-style schematic involves altering its material appearance from leather to line-based representation. This change must preserve correct proportions and avoid distorted shapes or broken lines.
Question: Does the schematic outline of the wallet maintain accurate proportions and closed geometric shapes without jagged edges or missing lines?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the wallet's material from leather to a blueprint-style rendering, assess whether the new material appearance is consistent with technical drawings (e.g., clean lines, uniform stroke width, absence of texture). The original leather has visible grain and stitching; these should be replaced by precise annotations and outlines without retaining any realistic leather texture.
Question: Are the lines forming the wallet’s schematic structure uniformly thin, continuous, and free of smudges or inconsistent thickness that suggest texture or artifact?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding annotations next to each currency slot in the wallet, evaluate whether these labels are positioned logically relative to the banknote positions (USD, QAR, INR) and do not overlap or distort the layout. The original image shows distinct bill types emerging from the wallet—US $20, Qatari Riyal, Indian Rupee—and their corresponding slots must be clearly marked without misalignment.
Question: Are the text annotations for “USD,” “QAR,” and “INR” placed adjacent to their respective banknote slots without overlapping the notes or distorting the wallet’s layout?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of including chart data illustrating exchange rates alongside country economy icons, assess whether these elements are integrated into the composition without violating spatial logic. These charts and icons must appear in a clean, modern design format near the wallet, maintaining proper scale and alignment relative to the wallet and currency sections.
Question: Are the exchange rate charts and country economy icons aligned horizontally or vertically in a balanced manner, with no floating or misplaced elements that disrupt visual flow?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving the core elements (banknotes) while modifying the wallet, evaluate whether the banknotes retain their original visual details such as color, denomination numbers, and patterns. The USD $20, QAR 10, and INR 50 notes must remain recognizable and undistorted, even if they are now part of an infographic context.
Question: Do the visible banknotes (USD $20, QAR 10, INR 50) retain clear denominations, readable text, and intact designs without blurring, stretching, or pixelation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
