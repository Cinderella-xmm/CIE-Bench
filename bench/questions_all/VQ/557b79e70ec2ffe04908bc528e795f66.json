Specifically, it checks if the eyes, nose, and mouth retain their relative positions and proportions, avoiding stretching or warping that would break structural consistency.",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) aligned and proportionally consistent with each other, without any visible stretching or distortion?",

It checks for natural volume, softness, and flow, ensuring that the fur does not appear flat, clumped, or artificially layered, which could indicate poor texture synthesis.",
      "question": "Does the hair appear voluminous and fluffy with natural strands and flow, without flat patches or artificial layering?",
