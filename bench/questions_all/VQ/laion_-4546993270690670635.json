      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the modern suit with dark velvet robes featuring golden embroidery, this question evaluates whether the new fabric's texture, sheen, and folds appear natural and consistent with real-world materials. The focus is on the upper body, particularly the lapel, sleeve cuffs, and shoulder area, where fabric behavior under light is most visible.",
      "question": "Does the dark velvet robe show realistic fabric folds and light reflection consistent with thick, heavy material, and do the golden embroidery patterns follow natural thread-like textures without pixelation or jagged edges?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the background to include intricate wooden shelves and ancient tomes, this question checks whether the newly added architectural details maintain proper perspective, depth, and material authenticity. The focus is on the bookshelf structure behind the figure and the appearance of the books.",
      "question": "Are the wooden shelves aligned with the original bookcase structure in terms of depth and angle, and do the books display consistent spine thickness, aging effects, and shadows that match the overall lighting?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a quill and parchment in the hands, this question examines whether the hand-object interaction is physically plausible. The focus is on the right hand holding the quill and the left hand supporting the parchment, ensuring correct finger positioning, occlusion, and texture continuity.",
      "question": "Do the fingers wrap naturally around the quill and parchment without extra digits, unnatural bending, or gaps between skin and object, and is the parchment folded in a way that matches real paper flexibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing an ornate inkstand on the armrest, this question assesses whether the object integrates seamlessly with the chair’s surface. The focus is on the armrest’s curvature and material, checking for proper shadow casting, reflection, and scale.",
      "question": "Is the inkstand positioned flush with the armrest surface, casting a soft shadow consistent with the light source, and does it have reflective metallic properties that match the surrounding environment without appearing flat or artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adjusting lighting to simulate candlelight ambiance, this question evaluates whether the lighting changes affect all elements uniformly and realistically. The focus is on facial illumination, fabric highlights, and shadows cast by the inkstand and books.",
      "question": "Does the warm light source create soft gradients on the face, highlight the golden embroidery, and produce gentle shadows beneath the chin and arms, with no abrupt transitions or mismatched brightness levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
