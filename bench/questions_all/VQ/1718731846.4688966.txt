Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the small dog figurine into a polished wood carving while maintaining its black-and-white color pattern through contrasting wood tones, evaluate whether the material transformation at the entire body of the dog preserves structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows a soft, fur-covered puppy with smooth contours; the edit must replace this with wood texture without distorting shape or introducing unnatural surface inconsistencies. This involves checking if the wood grain appears natural, consistent with polished carving, and whether the transition from fur to wood maintains the original form’s integrity.
Question: Does the entire body of the dog exhibit a uniform, polished wood texture with visible grain patterns that follow the contours of the figure, without abrupt transitions or unnatural patches?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the black-and-white color pattern using contrasting wood tones, assess whether the facial color division (black on left side, white on right) is preserved in the wood carving style. The original image has a clear split down the center of the face; the edit must replicate this using darker and lighter wood shades. This requires evaluating if the contrast between the two sides is sharp and anatomically aligned, without bleeding or misalignment that would compromise realism.
Question: Is the black-and-white facial pattern accurately represented by distinct dark and light wood tones along the central vertical line of the face, with no smudging or misalignment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of accentuating facial features with fine carved lines, examine whether the eyes, nose, mouth, and ear edges are enhanced with subtle engraved details typical of wood carving. The original image has large expressive eyes and defined muzzle; these should now be rendered with incised lines to suggest depth and craftsmanship. This evaluates whether such details are present and proportionate, avoiding over-carving or unrealistic line placement.
Question: Are the facial features—such as the eye sockets, nose bridge, and mouth outline—accentuated with fine, realistic carved lines that enhance depth without distorting proportions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using smooth, rounded contours for realism, evaluate whether the overall shape of the dog—including limbs, head, and ears—retains the original soft, rounded form but now interpreted in wood. The original image has gently curved surfaces; any angularity or flatness introduced during the material change would break visual credibility. This checks for geometric distortion or loss of volume due to the material transformation.
Question: Do all body parts—head, ears, legs, and paws—maintain smooth, rounded contours consistent with the original form, without flattened areas or sharp edges that suggest poor carving?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of positioning the figure on a minimalist wooden platform to highlight craftsmanship and contrast with the original bright palette, assess whether the base is added appropriately. The original image has a plain background with no base; the new version should include a simple, clean wooden platform beneath the dog. This checks for proper alignment, shadow consistency, and material harmony between the figure and platform, ensuring no floating effect or mismatched textures.
Question: Is the dog placed on a flat, minimalist wooden platform that matches the material tone and finish of the figure, with proper grounding and consistent lighting shadows?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
