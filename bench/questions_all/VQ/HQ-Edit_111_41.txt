Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the office chair into a LEGO model using sleek black for cushions, silver for armrests and base, and translucent gray for wheels, evaluate whether the material transformation at the seat cushion maintains structural coherence and visual credibility. The original image shows a smooth leather-like texture on the seat; replacing it with layered LEGO bricks must preserve geometric consistency and avoid unnatural textures or distortions in shape.
Question: Are the seat cushion's surfaces composed of clearly defined, uniformly sized LEGO brick layers with smooth gradients between them, maintaining a consistent black color without texture artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of assembling the backrest from layered bricks with smooth gradients, assess whether the vertical ribbed structure of the original backrest has been accurately converted into stacked LEGO elements while preserving proportion and alignment. The original backrest features horizontal stitching lines that should now be replaced by brick layers without breaking geometric continuity.
Question: Does the backrest consist of evenly spaced, horizontally aligned LEGO brick layers that follow the original contour without gaps, misalignments, or irregular spacing?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using silver for the armrests and base, evaluate whether the metallic components (armrests and five-star base) have been transformed into LEGO-style structures with appropriate material properties. The original armrests are curved metal tubes; their conversion to hinged LEGO parts must maintain structural plausibility and avoid deformation or loss of form.
Question: Are the armrests rendered as simple hinged LEGO pieces with clean edges and uniform silver finish, preserving their original curvature and connection points without distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using translucent gray for the wheels, assess whether the casters have been replaced with LEGO-style wheels featuring translucent gray material. The original wheels are solid black with a matte finish; changing them to translucent gray requires evaluating if the transparency is applied consistently and realistically across all five wheels.
Question: Are all five wheels made of translucent gray material with visible internal structure resembling LEGO wheel design, and do they maintain consistent size and placement under the base?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the LEGO chair on a plain white tabletop to highlight its geometric construction, evaluate whether the background and surface have been modified to include a flat white table surface beneath the chair. This change affects spatial context and composition; the transition from floor to tabletop must be seamless and physically plausible.
Question: Is the chair positioned on a flat, uninterrupted white tabletop surface that contrasts with the original floor, with no visible shadows or depth inconsistencies suggesting misalignment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
