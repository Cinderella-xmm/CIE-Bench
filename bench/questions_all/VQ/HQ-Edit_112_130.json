      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the kimono with a Victorian brocade gown featuring puffy sleeves, this question evaluates whether the new garment has natural fabric draping, realistic texture, and proper volume without distorting the figure or creating unnatural creases. The position is the woman’s torso and arms, where the gown should follow human anatomy.",
      "question": "Does the brocade gown have natural-looking folds and volume in the puffy sleeves and skirt, with no stretched or flattened areas that contradict fabric behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing cherry blossoms with roses, this question checks whether the new flowers are realistically shaped and attached to branches, avoiding mismatched geometry or unnatural clustering. The editing position is the tree canopy and surrounding air space where petals fall.",
      "question": "Are the rose blossoms evenly distributed along the branches with natural petal shapes and color variation, and do they align with the direction of light without appearing pasted or duplicated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues in the background, this question assesses whether these structures are geometrically accurate, properly scaled, and integrated into the depth of the scene without floating or perspective errors. The editing position is the mid-to-far background.",
      "question": "Do the wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues have consistent line work, proper shadowing, and spatial alignment with the ground plane and surrounding trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence in the violin-playing action, this question evaluates the realism of the woman’s hands holding the violin and bow. The editing position is her left hand on the neck of the violin and right hand holding the bow.",
      "question": "Does the left hand have five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and does the right hand grip the bow in a physically plausible manner without extra digits or distorted joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts in material textures, this question checks whether the brocade pattern, ironwork, and stone surfaces exhibit consistent detail and no visible repetition, blurring, or edge artifacts. The editing positions include the gown’s surface, gazebo railings, and statue surfaces.",
      "question": "Are the brocade patterns on the gown, the metal mesh of the gazebo, and the stone texture of the statues free from repeating tiles, pixelation, or unnatural smoothness that suggests low-resolution generation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
