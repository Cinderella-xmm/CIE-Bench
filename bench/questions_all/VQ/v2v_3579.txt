Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility while positioning the sushi pieces to form a human figure with a lifted arm, we need to assess if the transition between the sushi pieces forming the body and the arm appears natural and coherent.
Question: Do the sushi pieces forming the human figure maintain a natural and coherent structure without any visible breaks or distortions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: To ensure the overall authenticity and natural appearance, we need to verify if the colors of the sushi pieces used to create the human figure match those of the original sushi map, avoiding any unnatural color discrepancies.
Question: Are the colors of the sushi pieces used to form the human figure consistent with the original sushi map, without any unnatural color variations?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Evaluating the absence of obvious artifacts, we need to check if the edges of the sushi pieces forming the human figure are sharp and well-defined, ensuring there are no blurred or pixelated areas.
Question: Are the edges of the sushi pieces forming the human figure sharp and well-defined, without any blurred or pixelated artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: To confirm the physical rationality and proportion of the elements, we need to assess if the size and shape of the sushi pieces forming the human figure are proportionate and realistic compared to the original sushi pieces.
Question: Are the sizes and shapes of the sushi pieces forming the human figure proportionate and realistic compared to the original sushi pieces, without any unnatural scaling or distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Ensuring the visual credibility and structural consistency, we need to verify if the positioning of the sushi pieces to form the lifted arm is anatomically plausible and does not introduce any unnatural bends or angles.
Question: Does the positioning of the sushi pieces to form the lifted arm appear anatomically plausible, without any unnatural bends or angles?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
