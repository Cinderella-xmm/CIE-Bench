      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding a glass display case around the car and road,\" this question evaluates whether the glass enclosure is structurally coherent and visually credible. The glass should have clean edges, appropriate reflections, and a transparent boundary that does not float or intersect improperly with the scene. It must also maintain physical plausibility in terms of thickness and framing.",
      "question": "Is the glass display case surrounding the car and road clearly defined with smooth edges, proper transparency, and no floating or misaligned sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"applying metallic red and gradient hues to the car's 3D model,\" this question checks whether the car retains its original shape and surface details while incorporating new material properties. The metallic finish should reflect light naturally, and gradients should follow the curvature of the car without unnatural color shifts or loss of fine lines.",
      "question": "Does the carâ€™s surface exhibit consistent metallic red coloring with smooth gradient transitions and preserved sharp detail lines along the body panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"using layered resin for the road and cliffs to simulate depth,\" this question evaluates whether the resin layers create a believable sense of depth and material authenticity. Each layer should have varying opacity and thickness, and transitions between them should be smooth without abrupt cuts or flat appearances.",
      "question": "Are the resin layers in the road and cliff areas visibly distinct with gradual transparency and depth cues, avoiding flat or uniformly colored sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"embedding micro gravel for texture,\" this question examines whether the gravel appears natural in distribution, size, and interaction with light. It should not look like a repeating pattern or digital noise and should integrate with the underlying surface without disrupting the overall texture.",
      "question": "Is the micro gravel texture evenly distributed across the road and cliff surfaces, with natural variation in size and no repetitive or artificial patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"positioning a sunset sky panel atop for visual balance,\" this question checks whether the sky panel integrates seamlessly with the original sky. The colors and gradient should match the existing sunset, and the panel should not appear as a separate, unconnected element with visible edges or mismatches.",
      "question": "Does the sunset sky panel blend smoothly with the original sky, maintaining consistent color gradients and horizon alignment without visible seams or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"scaling all elements to reflect a miniature diorama,\" this question assesses whether the relative sizes of the car, road, cliffs, and display case are proportionally accurate for a diorama. The car should not appear disproportionately large compared to the road or case, and the cliffs should not extend beyond the frame unnaturally.",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the car, road, cliffs, and display case consistent with a miniature scale, avoiding exaggerated or unrealistic sizing relationships?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
