Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of retaining only the zebra on the left and the ground while removing the grassland and the second zebra in the background, judge whether the removal of the second zebra and grassland maintains structural coherence and avoids introducing unintended artifacts.
Question: Has the removal of the second zebra and grassland resulted in a clean transition without visible artifacts or unnatural edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement to replace the grass with a green gradient plane, evaluate whether this replacement maintains visual plausibility and structural consistency with the retained zebra and ground.
Question: Does the green gradient plane replacing the grass blend seamlessly with the zebra and ground, maintaining natural gradients and avoiding sharp contrasts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of ensuring the retained zebra ensures structural consistency and visual credibility, assess the integrity of the zebraâ€™s form post-editing.
Question: Is the zebra on the left intact and proportionally correct, with no signs of distortion or unnatural texture?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement to avoid introducing artifacts and maintain fine details, evaluate the level of detail in the retained elements, particularly the zebra and ground.
Question: Are the details of the zebra's stripes and the ground's texture well-preserved, ensuring high-quality representation without loss of detail?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the sub requirement to create a calm and solitary visual atmosphere, assess whether the overall composition successfully conveys this intended mood while being visually credible.
Question: Does the final composition effectively convey a calm and solitary atmosphere without any elements disrupting the visual harmony?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
