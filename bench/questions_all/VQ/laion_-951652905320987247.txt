Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the snow-capped mountain into a glittering, textured material within a terrarium context, evaluate whether the texture and material applied to the peak maintain visual plausibility and avoid unnatural artifacts. The original image shows a smooth, natural snow cover on Mount Fuji; replacing it with glittering material must not introduce visible pixelation, inconsistent sparkle patterns, or disrupted surface geometry that breaks realism.
Question: Does the snow-capped peak exhibit a consistent, non-uniform glittering texture that mimics natural snow while avoiding blocky or artificial sparkles?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of creating intricate fine-brushed foliage for the landscape below the mountain, assess whether the vegetation in the mid-ground has been altered to appear overly detailed or stylized in a way that contradicts natural plant growth patterns. The original image shows layered forest and grassland with realistic gradients; any added fine brushwork should not create repetitive, patterned textures or distort natural contours.
Question: Are the tree lines and grasslands along the base of the mountain rendered with natural variation in color and density, without repeating brush-like strokes or artificial line artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a reflective translucent resin layer as a lake, evaluate whether the water surface maintains a clear reflection of the mountain and surrounding elements while preserving the transparency and fluidity expected of resin. The original image features a calm, mirror-like lake; any replacement with resin must not introduce unnatural gloss, uneven refraction, or distortion in the reflected image.
Question: Is the lake surface uniformly reflective with no visible distortion, warping, or artificial shine that breaks the continuity of the mountain's reflection?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing tiny chalet figurines along the shoreline, assess whether these structures are proportionally correct relative to the mountain and lake, and whether they appear integrated into the scene without floating or misaligned placement. The original image includes small buildings near the shore; inserting miniature figurines must preserve scale and alignment with the environment.
Question: Are the chalet figurines positioned at ground level along the shoreline with proper scale and shadow alignment, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with lighting direction?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of encasing the entire scene within a glass terrarium, evaluate whether the edges of the terrarium (if visible) are seamlessly integrated without introducing framing artifacts, reflections, or distortion. While the original image lacks such boundaries, adding a transparent enclosure must not cause visual inconsistencies like double edges, ghosting, or refractive anomalies.
Question: Are there any visible seams, distortions, or artificial reflections around the perimeter of the scene that suggest an unnatural glass boundary?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
