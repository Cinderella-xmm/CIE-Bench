The position to be observed is the lettuce portion within the sandwich.",
      "question": "Do the lettuce shapes appear as intended smears without breaking their natural connection to the sandwich and without introducing any unnatural textures?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The sub requirement emphasizes the addition of sauce decorations around the plate, ensuring these additions complement the existing elements without disrupting the visual coherence or introducing artifacts. The area to focus on is the region surrounding the plate.",
      "question": "Are the added sauce decorations around the plate visually coherent, maintaining a smooth transition with the plate and table without causing any unnatural disruptions or artifacts?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The goal of emphasizing the sandwich cross-section texture requires checking if the edits enhance the texture in a way that it remains authentic and does not introduce any artificial or awkward patterns. The specific point of concern is the visible cross-section of the bread and its inner contents.",
      "question": "Does the enhanced cross-section texture of the sandwich appear natural and detailed without any obvious artificial patterns or textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Simplifying the sandwich elements into a thick-painted cartoon style means assessing if the style conversion retains some realism and avoids unnatural distortions. The entire sandwich and its components should be inspected.",
      "question": "Has the thick-painted cartoon style been applied uniformly across the sandwich with a realistic touch, avoiding any distortions or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The conversion to a thick-painted style implies ensuring that all elements maintain structural consistency and visual credibility. This includes the relationship between the sandwich and the plate as well as the salad on the side.",
      "question": "Does the sandwich structure retain its integrity and logical placement on the plate alongside the salad, all while maintaining visual credibility in the thick-painted style?",

        "Yes",
