Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the overall realism and natural appearance while adding text to the image, we need to ensure that the introduction of new elements does not disrupt the existing structure and texture of the cat's fur, whiskers, and eyes. The visual blending and shadowing of the added text should complement rather than detract from the natural appearance of the cat. 
Question: Does the addition of the text "Warm Home" and "Adopt Love" introduce any unnatural textures or visibly distorted areas on the cat's fur, whiskers, or eyes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: No  

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of structural coherence and visual plausibility, the placement of the text within the image should not interfere with key visual elements like the cat's face and body proportions. The text must be positioned in a way that does not break the geometric shapes of the cat's features and maintains a balanced composition. 
Question: Does the placement of the text "Warm Home" and "Adopt Love" maintain structural consistency and avoid disrupting the proportions and physical rationality of the cat's face and body?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q3: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement that ensures the core elements retain their natural appearance, it is essential to check if the cat's facial expression, fur pattern, and overall posture remain authentic after the text has been added. The editing should preserve the cat's original charm and characteristics without introducing any artificial or incongruent elements.
Question: Has the natural appearance and authenticity of the cat's expression, fur pattern, and posture been preserved despite the addition of the text "Warm Home" and "Adopt Love"?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q4: 
Thinking process: Reflecting on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts and loss of details, it is crucial to evaluate if the fine details of the cat, such as the individual strands of fur, whiskers, and paw pads, remain sharp and undistorted. The presence of any blurring or pixelation around these fine details would indicate poor editing quality.
Question: Are the fine details of the cat, such as individual strands of fur, whiskers, and paw pads, free from blurring or pixelation after the editing?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement to maintain visual credibility and structural rationality, the added text should integrate naturally into the scene without causing any logical inconsistencies. For instance, the text should not appear to overlap with the cat in a way that defies common sense or appears unnaturally embedded in the fur.
Question: Does the integration of the text "Warm Home" and "Adopt Love" into the image avoid logical inconsistencies such as overlapping unnaturally with the cat's fur or appearing embedded in a way that defies common sense?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
