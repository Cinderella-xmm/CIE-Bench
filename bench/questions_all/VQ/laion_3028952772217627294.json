      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the cactus into a 3D plush doll mockup with visible detailed stitches, particularly on its sombrero and body, this question evaluates whether the stitch patterns are realistically rendered and consistent with the knitted texture present in the original image. The focus is on the material appearance and structural fidelity of the cactus's surface, including the sombrero’s brim and crown, which must show uniform, continuous knit stitches without breaks or unnatural spacing.",
      "question": "Are the stitches on the cactus’s body and sombrero clearly visible, evenly spaced, and consistent with the knitting style of the surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of designing the donkey as a realistic plush prototype with a textured mane and striped pattern, this question checks whether the mane's black yarn strands are properly shaped and attached, and whether the rainbow-colored stripes on the donkey’s back follow logical knitting patterns without misalignment or color bleed. The evaluation focuses on texture continuity and geometric coherence of the added features.",
      "question": "Do the mane and striped pattern on the donkey display natural yarn-like texture and proper alignment without visible distortions or gaps between stitches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining proportion and physical rationality, this question examines whether the cactus and donkey retain their original anatomical proportions after transformation into plush forms. Specifically, it checks if the limbs, head, and body sizes are consistent with real-world expectations for plush toys, avoiding elongation, compression, or disproportionate scaling.",
      "question": "Are the limbs and body proportions of both the cactus and donkey preserved in a way that reflects typical plush toy design without unnatural stretching or shrinking?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating a colorful packaging box labeled \"Knitted Amigos\" with Mexican motifs, this question evaluates whether the box appears physically plausible within the scene—specifically, whether it casts appropriate shadows, aligns with the lighting direction, and does not overlap or conflict with the placement of the plush figures or background elements.",
      "question": "Is the packaging box positioned in a way that suggests it is part of the same scene, with consistent lighting and shadow direction relative to the plush toys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining consistent material appearance and avoiding artifacts, this question assesses whether the transitions between different parts of the plush toys (e.g., between the cactus body and pot, donkey legs and torso) are seamless and free from jagged edges, color fringing, or ghosting effects that might indicate poor editing.",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged edges, color bleeding, or double outlines at the boundaries between the cactus, pot, donkey, and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
