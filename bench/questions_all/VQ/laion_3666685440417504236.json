      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the architectural ensemble must be scaled down and placed inside a ceramic globe without distorting proportions or geometry, this question evaluates whether the dome, minaret, and arches retain their original shapes and spatial relationships when miniaturized. Any stretching, squashing, or angular inconsistencies would compromise structural coherence.",
      "question": "Are the dome, minaret, and arches inside the globe proportionally accurate and geometrically intact, with no warped edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the interior includes miniature palm trees and a cobblestone path, this question checks if these newly added elements are correctly scaled relative to the architecture and placed logically. The trees should not appear oversized or misplaced, and the path should follow a natural trajectory toward the entrance.",
      "question": "Do the palm trees and cobblestone path inside the globe appear at a consistent scale with the architecture and follow a plausible layout leading to the entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the exterior of the globe features intricate Persian patterns matching the original tilework, this question assesses whether the patterns are continuous, non-repeating, and stylistically coherent with the original building’s design. Artifacts such as tile seams, color mismatches, or abrupt pattern breaks would indicate poor integration.",
      "question": "Are the Persian patterns on the exterior of the globe continuous, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the tilework seen on the original building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that golden highlights are added to the dome and arches, this question examines whether the gold accents are applied naturally—such as along ridges or edges—without appearing as flat overlays or digital brush strokes. Realistic metallic sheen and subtle reflectivity should be present.",
      "question": "Are the golden highlights on the dome and arches applied in a way that follows natural light interaction, with no flat, overly bright, or artificially drawn lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the transition between the interior scene and the globe’s surface must be smooth and free of distortion, this question checks for visual artifacts such as edge blurring, pixelation, or incorrect refraction effects that might suggest a poorly rendered glass or transparent boundary.",
      "question": "Is the boundary between the interior scene and the globe’s surface clean and free of jagged edges, transparency glitches, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
