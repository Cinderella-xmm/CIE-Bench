      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing gemstone details with embroidered patterns in vibrant blues and golds across the butterfly’s wings and body, this question evaluates whether the embroidery accurately follows the original gemstone layout and maintains natural stitching appearance. The specific editing position includes the wing surfaces and body, where gemstones were originally placed in clusters and lines. The transition from reflective crystals to thread-based patterns must not introduce jagged edges or mismatched colors.",
      "question": "Are the embroidered patterns on the butterfly’s wings and body aligned with the original gemstone positions and do they display consistent thread density and color without visible breaks or misalignments?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the metallic gold base with soft fabric material, this question checks whether the material transition from rigid metal to textile is believable. The original butterfly has a defined gold outline and frame; in the edited version, this should now appear as part of a fabric structure. The focus is on whether the material looks flexible and non-reflective, consistent with textile, rather than retaining metallic sheen or rigidity.",
      "question": "Does the butterfly’s body and frame appear made of soft fabric with no visible metallic shine or rigid edges, and does it show natural fabric folds or drape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying velvety material to the wings, this question assesses whether the texture appears uniformly soft and matte, consistent with velvet. The original wings have a highly reflective, faceted surface due to gemstones; the edited version must replace this with a non-reflective, slightly textured surface typical of velvet. The evaluation focuses on the wing surfaces to ensure no residual gloss or crystal-like highlights remain.",
      "question": "Do the wing surfaces exhibit a uniform, matte, soft-textured appearance consistent with velvet, with no shiny spots or reflections resembling gemstones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding fluffy texture along the wing edges, this question evaluates whether the fluff is evenly applied and physically plausible. The original butterfly has sharp, clean wing tips; in the edited version, these edges should be softened with fluffy trim. The focus is on whether the fluff appears natural, not artificially layered or clumped, and whether it adheres smoothly to the wing contours.",
      "question": "Is the fluffy trim along the wing edges evenly distributed, soft, and attached in a way that follows the wing’s natural curve without appearing detached or uneven?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the butterfly’s original shape and proportions, this question checks whether the transformation preserves the butterfly’s structural integrity. The original butterfly has symmetrical wings, a defined body, and curved antennae. The edited version must retain these features without distortion, such as warped wings or disproportionate body size.",
      "question": "Are the butterfly’s wings symmetrically shaped, the body proportionate to the wings, and the antennae correctly positioned and curved, with no visible warping or scaling errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the plush butterfly atop a plain pearl-white cushion, this question evaluates the visual credibility of the composition. The cushion must appear flat, uniformly colored, and positioned beneath the butterfly in a way that suggests support. The focus is on whether the butterfly casts a natural shadow and sits flush on the surface without floating or unnatural gaps.",
      "question": "Is the butterfly resting on a smooth, uniformly pearl-white cushion with a natural shadow underneath, indicating proper contact and physical grounding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
