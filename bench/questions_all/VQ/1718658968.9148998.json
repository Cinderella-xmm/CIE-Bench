      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the stone texture with wooden puzzle pieces, this question evaluates whether the material transformation at the castle's exterior (towers, walls, windows, and base) maintains natural wood appearance without introducing unnatural textures, such as repetitive patterns, inconsistent grain, or mismatched color patches. The focus is on the visual authenticity of the wood material across all surfaces.",
      "question": "Are the wooden puzzle pieces covering the castle's exterior uniformly textured with natural oak and mahogany variations, showing no repeating patterns or artificial seams?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the original architectural form, this question checks whether the structural geometry of the towers, central archway, and connecting walls remains intact after material replacement. The goal is to ensure no warping, stretching, or collapse of shapes due to editing, preserving visual credibility.",
      "question": "Do the towers, archway, and surrounding walls retain their original shape and proportions without any geometric distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of intricate interlocking details on the tower tops, this question assesses whether the top edges of both towers display clearly defined, interlocking wooden puzzle joints that appear physically plausible and structurally sound, rather than floating or broken pieces.",
      "question": "Are the top edges of both towers composed of clearly interlocked wooden puzzle pieces with no gaps, floating fragments, or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the scene on a smooth wooden tabletop, this question evaluates whether the base of the castle is seamlessly grounded on a flat, continuous wooden surface that matches the material style and lighting of the structure, avoiding abrupt transitions or unnatural shadows.",
      "question": "Is the castle resting on a smooth, continuous wooden surface that matches the wood type and finish of the puzzle pieces, with consistent lighting and shadow under the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving natural material appearance, this question checks whether the lighting interaction with the wooden surface—such as reflections, highlights, and shadows—is consistent with real wood, particularly in areas like the water reflection and base of the structure, to ensure realism.",
      "question": "Do the reflections in the water and shadows beneath the castle show accurate interaction with the wooden surface, with no unnatural glare, color shifts, or floating reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
