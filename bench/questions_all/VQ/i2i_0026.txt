Question: Are the body proportions and movements in the line art consistent and natural throughout the four frames?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2:

Question: Do the tennis racket and the ball retain their realistic textures and details without introducing any unnatural artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of ensuring the structural coherence and visual plausibility of the edited image, determine if the hand's position and grip on the racket appear ergonomic and natural in all four frames.
Question: Is the hand's position and grip on the racket depicted naturally and ergonomically in each of the four frames?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Guided by the sub requirement of maintaining a clean line art style with monochrome color fill, verify if the elimination of the background and the application of monochrome colors maintain the visual clarity and the lack of any visual distortion.
Question: Does the removal of the background and the application of monochrome colors preserve visual clarity without causing any distortion or loss of detail?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: In alignment with the sub requirement of ensuring the overall authenticity and natural appearance, assess whether the sequence of actions from preparing to follow-through in the clean line art style appears coherent and believable.
