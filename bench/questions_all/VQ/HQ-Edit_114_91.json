      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the hammerhead into an owl-like face with ivy eyes, this question evaluates whether the facial features (especially the eyes made of ivy) are proportionally accurate, anatomically plausible for an owl, and integrated without sharp seams or unnatural curvature. The position is the top of the hammer where the head meets the handle.",
      "question": "Are the ivy formations on the hammerhead shaped like symmetrical, watchful eyes with natural leaf arrangement and no visible digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing rust with moss-covered bark, this question checks whether the texture transition across the hammer and anvil surfaces is seamless, with consistent scale and color variation typical of natural moss and bark. The focus is on the entire surface of the hammer and anvil.",
      "question": "Does the moss-covered bark texture cover the hammer and anvil uniformly without abrupt color shifts, patchy areas, or synthetic-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of shaping the anvil body into a tree trunk with root-like structures, this question assesses whether the base of the anvil displays natural root extensions that emerge from the ground, follow gravity, and maintain thickness proportional to the trunk. The position is the lower portion of the anvil and its contact point with the wooden table.",
      "question": "Do the root-like structures beneath the anvil extend downward from the base in a way that mimics real tree roots, with tapering thickness and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of embedding glowing emerald runes into the bark surface, this question examines whether the runes are engraved into the texture without breaking surface continuity, emit soft, diffused light, and do not create unnatural highlights or halos. The position is the side and top surface of the anvil body.",
      "question": "Are the emerald runes integrated into the bark surface such that they appear carved in, with subtle glow that blends into the surrounding texture and does not cause bright outlines or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of crawling ivy tendrils across the structure, this question evaluates whether the vines grow naturally along edges, wrap around the hammer and anvil, and connect to surrounding foliage without floating or intersecting unrealistically. The position includes all visible ivy strands on the hammer, anvil, and adjacent surfaces.",
      "question": "Do the ivy tendrils follow logical climbing paths from the window frame and floor, wrapping around the hammer and anvil without crossing through solid parts or appearing suspended in mid-air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining visual credibility and structural consistency with the environment, this question checks whether the shadows, lighting, and depth of the transformed anvil and hammer align with the ambient light coming from the window and the surrounding objects. The position is the entire edited object in relation to the background and foreground.",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the transformed anvil and hammer fall consistently with the light source from the window, and do they interact naturally with the wooden table and surrounding tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
