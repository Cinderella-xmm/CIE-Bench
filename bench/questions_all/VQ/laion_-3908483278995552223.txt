Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction requires transforming the Aquatic warrior (Aquaman) from the original poster into a compact 3D model encased in a marine-themed dome. This involves a significant transformation of the character's form and environment, shifting from a 2D cinematic poster to a 3D display object. The original image shows Aquaman in full armor with a trident, standing against a stylized background. Key elements include his detailed metallic armor, long hair, beard, trident, and the geometric backdrop. The transformation must preserve the core identity of the figure while introducing new elements such as the dome, base, and ocean currents. This raises concerns about structural coherence during conversion, material consistency (especially in metallic blue tones), and the naturalness of added dynamic effects like swirling currents. The hand holding the trident must retain anatomical accuracy. The dome must appear physically plausible without visual distortions. The coral reef base must be proportionally consistent with the scale of the model. The overall composition must maintain visual credibility.

-Sub requirement 1: Transforming the 2D character into a 3D model must preserve structural integrity and anatomical accuracy, particularly in limbs, armor geometry, and facial features.
-Sub requirement 2: The metallic blue tone applied to the armor must reflect realistic material properties, including light interaction and surface texture, without unnatural color shifts or flat shading.
-Sub requirement 3: The trident must retain its original shape and imposing stature in scale relative to the model, avoiding shrinkage or distortion during the 3D conversion.
-Sub requirement 4: The marine-themed dome must be visually coherent—its curvature, transparency, and reflections should not introduce geometric artifacts or inconsistent lighting.
-Sub requirement 5: The faux coral reef base must be proportionally scaled to support the model and must exhibit natural textures and forms without artificial-looking patterns.
-Sub requirement 6: The miniature ocean currents around the figure must simulate fluid motion without breaking physical plausibility, such as unnatural flow directions or disconnected particles.
-Sub requirement 7: The hand gripping the trident must maintain five fingers with natural joint alignment, skin texture, and grip posture consistent with human anatomy.
-Sub requirement 8: The overall composition must maintain spatial logic—elements like the dome, currents, and base must align with the model’s position and scale without floating or misaligned components.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving structural integrity and anatomical accuracy during the 3D transformation, this question evaluates whether the figure's limbs, head, and armor maintain correct proportions and geometry. The original image shows a well-proportioned male figure with defined musculature and layered armor. Any distortion in the 3D model could result in elongated limbs, misshapen joints, or collapsed armor segments, which would compromise authenticity.
Question: Does the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior maintain accurate limb proportions and body structure without distorted joints or exaggerated features?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of applying metallic blue tones to the armor with realistic material properties, this question assesses whether the surface reflects light naturally, showing gradients, highlights, and shadows consistent with polished metal. The original armor has intricate patterns and reflective surfaces; in the edited version, these should remain visible and not appear flat or overly saturated.
Question: Are the metallic blue surfaces of the armor rendered with natural light reflections and depth, avoiding flat or uniform coloring?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the trident’s imposing stature and correct scale relative to the figure, this question checks if the trident is proportionally sized and structurally intact. In the original image, the trident is large and held firmly; in the 3D model, it must not appear shrunken, bent, or detached from the hand.
Question: Is the trident positioned correctly in the hand and scaled appropriately relative to the figure, without bending or truncation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that the marine-themed dome must be visually coherent with no geometric artifacts, this question evaluates whether the dome’s curvature is smooth, its transparency consistent, and its edges clean. Artifacts such as jagged lines, unnatural refractions, or mismatched lighting would indicate poor rendering quality.
Question: Does the dome enclosing the model have smooth curvature and consistent transparency without visible stitching, warping, or reflection anomalies?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that the faux coral reef base must exhibit natural textures and proportional scaling, this question examines whether the base supports the model realistically and displays organic shapes typical of coral formations. Artificial-looking patterns or disproportionate size would break visual credibility.
Question: Is the coral reef base textured with natural-looking organic patterns and scaled appropriately to support the model without appearing undersized or oversized?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that miniature ocean currents must simulate fluid motion without violating physical plausibility, this question checks if the currents flow smoothly around the model, follow logical directionality, and do not appear as static or disconnected particles.
Question: Do the swirling ocean currents around the model follow continuous, directional flow paths without abrupt breaks or floating fragments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q7: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that the hand gripping the trident must conform to human anatomy, this question verifies the number of fingers, joint alignment, and grip posture. The original image shows a five-fingered hand with natural positioning; any deviation would suggest digital manipulation errors.
Question: Does the hand holding the trident have exactly five fingers with natural joint angles and grip pressure, without extra digits or unnatural bends?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q8: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that the overall composition must maintain spatial logic, this question checks whether all elements—the model, dome, base, and currents—are aligned in a coherent 3D space. Misalignment, floating objects, or incorrect layering would reduce visual credibility.
Question: Are all elements (model, dome, base, currents) spatially aligned and layered correctly, with no floating or disconnected parts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
