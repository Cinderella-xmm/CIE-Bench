Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The instruction requires transforming the medieval house into a collectible board game asset, which involves significant changes to materials, textures, and composition. The original image features a detailed wooden and stone structure with red tiled roofing, arched doorways, and a chimney. Key areas for editing include the roof tiles, walls, base, doors, and surrounding elements like logs and barrels. The transformation must maintain structural coherence while introducing new materials (wooden planks replacing stone), adding moss texture at the base, and integrating fantasy characters and game-related elements. These edits may affect realism if not aligned with physical logic or material consistency.

-Sub requirement 1: Replace stone textures with wooden planks on the exterior walls—evaluate whether this replacement maintains visual credibility and avoids unnatural transitions between materials.
-Sub requirement 2: Add moss texture to the base of the building—assess whether the moss appears naturally integrated with the structure and does not create floating or disconnected patches.
-Sub requirement 3: Convert colors to earthy tones—determine if the color shift preserves natural appearance and avoids jarring contrasts or unnatural hues.
-Sub requirement 4: Integrate miniature fantasy characters beside the building—check if their scale, pose, and integration are physically plausible and do not distort the scene.
-Sub requirement 5: Add a parchment-style board with “Castle Quest” logo and title beneath the house—evaluate whether the board is proportionally sized, properly shaded, and visually consistent with the rest of the scene.
-Sub requirement 6: Position detailed rule booklets beside the set—verify that the booklets are realistically scaled, textured, and placed without overlapping or distorting nearby objects.
-Sub requirement 7: Ensure all added elements (characters, board, booklets) maintain structural consistency and do not introduce artifacts such as misaligned edges, missing shadows, or incorrect lighting.

Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing stone textures with wooden planks on the exterior walls, evaluate whether the material change maintains visual credibility and avoids unnatural transitions. The original image shows stone pillars and wall sections; replacing these with wood must preserve geometric continuity and avoid abrupt seams or mismatched grain patterns.
Question: Are the wooden planks on the walls seamlessly integrated with no visible gaps, misalignment, or unnatural texture repetition?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding moss texture to the base of the building, assess whether the moss appears naturally distributed and anchored to the structure. The base includes stone blocks and steps where moss would typically grow in crevices and along edges.
Question: Does the moss texture cover only appropriate surfaces (e.g., lower stone blocks, corners) and appear layered and organic without floating or flat patches?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting colors to earthy tones, determine if the overall color palette remains cohesive and free from unnatural shifts. The original has bright red tiles and warm wood tones; shifting to earthy tones should avoid overly desaturated or muddy hues that break visual harmony.
Question: Are the roof tiles, walls, and wooden elements uniformly adjusted to earthy tones without inconsistent color gradients or localized discoloration?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of integrating miniature fantasy characters beside the building, evaluate whether their placement respects scale, posture, and environmental interaction. Characters should be proportionally smaller than the house and positioned near entrances or pathways.
Question: Are the miniature characters correctly scaled relative to the house and positioned in plausible locations (e.g., near doors, paths) without floating or intersecting with structures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a parchment-style board with “Castle Quest” text beneath the house, assess whether the board is proportionally sized, properly shaded, and integrated into the scene. It should rest on the ground plane and cast a shadow consistent with the lighting.
Question: Is the parchment board positioned flat on the ground with realistic folds, texture, and shadow alignment matching the light source direction?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of positioning detailed rule booklets beside the set, verify that they are realistically rendered with visible pages, correct thickness, and proper shadowing. They should not overlap other objects or appear detached from the surface.
Question: Do the rule booklets have consistent page thickness, visible spine details, and shadows that align with the lighting and surface they rest on?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
