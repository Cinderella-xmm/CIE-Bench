Here, the stickers should retain a certain level of clarity and not appear pixelated or blurry.",
      "question": "Are the chibi-style illustrations free from unnatural textures and maintain clear details, avoiding any loss of definition?",

      "thinking_process": "To ensure the structural consistency and visual credibility of the edited image, the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi-style illustrations compared to their environment and other elements like the skateboarder must be evaluated. The size and placement should not appear disproportionate or inconsistent.",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi-style illustrations correctly match their surroundings, avoiding any distortion or inconsistency?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The editing instruction specifies that each ingredient should have unique actions and expressions, which involves ensuring these characteristics are presented without causing any visual distortion or deformation. The actions and expressions should be natural within the context of the overall image.",
      "question": "Are the actions and expressions assigned to the chibi-style illustrations natural and plausible, free from any distortion or deformation?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "When converting the ingredients into chibi-style illustrations, the style should align well with a recipe notebook theme while still maintaining a sense of realism and authenticity. The style should complement rather than clash with the existing visual elements.",
      "question": "Does the style of the chibi-style illustrations suitably match the recipe notebook theme and harmonize with the overall image without introducing unnatural elements?",
