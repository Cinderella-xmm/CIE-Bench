      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the wooden bookshelves into leaf-adorned wings in flight, this involves reshaping the straight, modular shelves into curved, wing-like structures. The evaluation focuses on whether the new wing shapes maintain structural continuity with the wall, avoid broken or warped edges, and integrate leaf textures seamlessly into the wood surface. The question assesses the natural appearance and absence of artifacts in the transformed shelf area.",
      "question": "Are the wing-shaped shelves formed from the original bookshelves smooth and continuous without jagged edges or missing segments, and do they feature leaf textures that blend naturally with the wood?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the hanging wicker lamps with luminescent fungi, the focus is on whether the new fungal forms match the original lamp positions and sizes, emit soft glow without harsh halos or pixelation, and maintain a naturalistic shape consistent with real fungi. The question evaluates material authenticity and lighting integration.",
      "question": "Do the hanging fungi occupy the same positions as the original lamps, have rounded caps and stems resembling real mushrooms, and display a soft glow without visible artifacts or unnatural brightness gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the woven chairs and stools into moss-covered rocks, the evaluation centers on whether the new rock forms maintain appropriate scale for seating, have irregular but natural surfaces, and feature moss growth patterns that follow typical biological distribution. The question checks for unnatural textures or disproportionate sizing.",
      "question": "Are the chair and stool replacements shaped like natural rocks with uneven surfaces and moss coverage that follows realistic growth patterns, and do they retain a size suitable for human seating?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of turning books into bird-like creatures with text-covered feathers, this transformation affects individual book spines and covers. The question evaluates whether each bird has a coherent body structure (head, wings, tail), feathers that resemble pages or text, and positioning that aligns with the original shelf layout. It checks for anatomical plausibility and legibility of text fragments.",
      "question": "Do the book-to-bird transformations show complete bird bodies with defined heads, wings, and tails, and do the feathers contain readable text fragments arranged in a natural pattern without distorted letters or gaps?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the bamboo ceiling beams with entwined branches, the evaluation examines whether the new branch network spans the ceiling continuously, avoids floating or disconnected limbs, and casts shadows consistent with the sunlight direction. The question checks structural coherence and physical logic of the canopy.",
      "question": "Are the entwined branches forming the ceiling connected and interlaced in a natural way without gaps or floating segments, and do they cast shadow patterns that align with the light source direction seen in the original image?",
