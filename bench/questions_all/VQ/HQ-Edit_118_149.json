      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the ballet dancer's pose into two elegant stickers—one with softened pastel colors and one with sharp geometric angles—this involves altering the visual style of the dancer’s form. The editing targets include her body shape, clothing, and pose, particularly in regions such as the leg, torso, and arms. The question evaluates whether the color transformation (to pastel tones) maintains natural skin tones and fabric textures without introducing unnatural gradients or color bleeding, especially around high-contrast areas like the leg and bodysuit junction.",
      "question": "Are the pastel-colored areas of the dancer's leotard and tights smoothly blended without visible color artifacts or unnatural transitions?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies adding detachable sections around her leg for dynamic layering effects. This implies modifying the lower limb area, specifically near the thigh and calf, to include layered segments that may appear separate from the main body. The evaluation focuses on whether these added sections preserve anatomical proportions and avoid geometric distortions such as misaligned edges, inconsistent thickness, or floating elements that break spatial continuity.",
      "question": "Do the detachable sections around the dancer’s leg maintain consistent thickness and alignment with the leg’s natural curvature, avoiding floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The sticker design includes a version with sharp geometric angles for a modern flair. This requires reshaping the dancer’s limbs and silhouette into angular forms, which may affect the natural flow of her posture, especially in the extended leg and arm positions. The evaluation checks whether the geometric transformation preserves structural coherence—such as joint alignment and limb proportion—without distorting anatomy or creating impossible angles.",
      "question": "Are the angular transformations applied to the dancer’s limbs physically plausible, with joints and limbs maintaining correct anatomical relationships and no exaggerated bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The edited image places the stickers on a sleek, beige journal. This involves integrating the dancer’s figure into a new background context. The focus is on whether the placement of the stickers respects perspective and lighting consistency with the journal surface—such as shadow alignment, texture matching, and edge blending—without appearing pasted or disconnected.",
      "question": "Are the edges of the dancer’s sticker figures cleanly integrated onto the journal surface, with shadows and lighting matching the surrounding environment?",

      "thinking_process": "The original image shows the dancer’s hands gripping the barre, with clearly defined fingers and natural hand positioning. When converted into a sticker format, especially with stylized or geometric versions, there is a risk of altering finger count, spacing, or shape. This question evaluates whether the hand details remain anatomically accurate and free from distortion, even after stylization.",
      "question": "Do the dancer’s hands retain five fingers each, with natural spacing and proportions, and no fused or extra digits?",
