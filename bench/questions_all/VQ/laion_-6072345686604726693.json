      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that metallic domes forming wings must retain consistent metallic texture and reflectivity, this question evaluates whether the wing-like structures have uniform surface properties and realistic reflections. The original domes are made of stone or tile materials; transforming them into metallic wings risks introducing unnatural sheen or texture mismatches. The question focuses on detecting visual artifacts like uneven glossiness, patchy textures, or inconsistent highlights.",
      "question": "Do the metallic wing structures exhibit uniform reflective properties and smooth surface transitions without visible seams or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that minarets transformed into legs must maintain anatomical plausibility, this question checks if the leg-like extensions from the original minarets follow logical proportions and structural continuity. The original minarets are tall, slender, and tapered; converting them into legs requires preserving similar tapering but adding joints and curvature. Any distortion in length, angle, or thickness could break visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are the leg-like structures derived from the minarets proportionally consistent with the rest of the structure and do they show natural curvature and joint-like articulation without stretching or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the central dome is replaced with a large jewel reflecting cosmic wonders, this question assesses whether the new element integrates naturally in terms of scale, lighting, and reflection. The original dome has a dome-shaped roof with a golden finial; replacing it with a jewel must avoid floating or detached appearance, and reflections should match the surrounding environmentâ€™s light source.",
      "question": "Does the central jewel reflect light and cosmic patterns in a way that matches the direction of sunlight and surrounding environment, without appearing to float or casting inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that glowing Byzantine patterns must not distort underlying architecture or introduce unnatural luminosity, this question evaluates whether the added glowing designs follow the contours of the building and respect the original lighting conditions. Glowing elements should not override surface details or create false depth through over-brightening.",
      "question": "Are the glowing patterns confined to surface-level details, following architectural lines, and do they emit light that blends with ambient illumination without creating harsh glows or obscuring textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that all edited areas must avoid visible artifacts such as blurring or seam lines, this question checks for signs of digital manipulation at the boundaries between original and modified regions. Especially around the transition zones between domes, minarets, and newly added features, there may be visible edges, ghosting, or loss of detail.",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, blurring, or color discontinuities at the junctions between the original building and the transformed elements such as wings, legs, or jewel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
