      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the church into fine china with intricate details, evaluate whether the material substitution preserves architectural geometry and surface consistency. The original church has defined stone blocks, arched windows, and domed towers. In the edited version, these should now resemble glazed porcelain with visible fine detailing but without warping or loss of structural lines.",
      "question": "Does the church's façade maintain its original architectural shape and symmetry when rendered in porcelain, with no distorted columns, misaligned arches, or broken edges?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing people with tiny pewter figures, assess whether the human forms are proportionally accurate and free from deformation. The original people are standing, walking, or seated in natural poses. In the edited image, these should be scaled-down metal figurines with correct limb ratios, five fingers per hand, and no fused or extra limbs.",
      "question": "Are all human figures replaced with pewter models that have anatomically correct hands with no more than five fingers, and do they maintain natural postures without joint bending or limb distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of encasing the scene in a baroque-styled dome, evaluate whether the dome is physically plausible and seamlessly integrated. The dome should cover the entire scene without intersecting objects unnaturally, and its ornate design should match baroque aesthetics without visual breaks or floating sections.",
      "question": "Is the baroque-style dome fully enclosing the scene without gaps, overlapping incorrectly with the church or ground, or showing seams or incomplete surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing trees with delicate glass versions, assess whether the glass trees maintain natural branching patterns and transparency. The original tree on the left side has a full canopy and trunk. In the edited version, it should appear translucent with visible internal structure but without blocky or pixelated edges.",
      "question": "Do the glass trees retain natural branch structures and show transparent, refractive qualities without jagged outlines or unnatural coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing café tables and umbrellas with miniature versions made of fine materials, evaluate whether the furniture retains correct proportions and structural integrity. The original café setup includes round tables, chairs, and large white umbrellas. These should now appear smaller, with thin legs and fabric-like canopies, but not flattened or skewed.",
      "question": "Are the café tables and umbrellas scaled down appropriately with intact shapes—specifically, do the umbrella canopies remain circular and the table legs remain straight and evenly spaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the scene on an antique marble base, evaluate whether the base has realistic texture, proper scale, and seamless integration with the diorama. The base should be larger than the scene and feature natural veining, not appear flat or digitally pasted.",
      "question": "Does the antique marble base display consistent veining patterns and appropriate thickness, and is it positioned directly beneath the scene without floating or clipping errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
