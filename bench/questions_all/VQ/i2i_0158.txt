Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of maintaining the overall realism and natural appearance while combining the carâ€™s front, left side, and rear views, examine if the transition between these views introduces unnatural textures or loss of details that could detract from the car's authenticity.
Question: Do the transitions between the front, left side, and rear views of the car appear smooth and free of unnatural artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Given the need to retain the core elements ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility, assess if the proportions and angles of the car parts remain physically rational and undistorted after combining different views.
Question: Are the proportions and angles of the car parts consistent and logical across the three views without showing any distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the maintained style and materials reflecting reality and natural appearance, verify if the surface texture and material properties of the car, such as reflections and shine on the bodywork, remain uniform and realistic throughout the combined views.
Question: Does the car's surface texture and material properties, like reflections and shine, appear uniform and realistic across all three views?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: To ensure that the editing does not introduce any unnatural effects that would undermine the overall visual plausibility, check if the lighting and shadow effects maintain consistency and coherence among the different views of the car.
Question: Are the lighting and shadow effects consistent and correctly aligned across all three views of the car?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Addressing the requirement of avoiding unnatural textures and maintaining structural coherence, inspect if the background elements blend well with the car and do not present any jarring inconsistencies or artifacts.
Question: Does the background seamlessly integrate with the car without introducing any jarring inconsistencies or artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
