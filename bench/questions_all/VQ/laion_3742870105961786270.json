      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the black jug into an ornate glass stopper, this transformation affects the top portion of the figure where the jug is currently held. The stopper must appear transparent or semi-transparent with reflective qualities typical of glass, and its shape should be proportionally consistent with the bottle neck. Any mismatch in transparency, reflection, or geometry would compromise realism.",
      "question": "Does the converted jug appear as a translucent glass stopper with visible reflections and refractions, and is it properly aligned with the bottle’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reshaping the robe into a bottle form, this transformation occurs from the midsection down. The original fabric folds must transition smoothly into a cylindrical or curved bottle silhouette without abrupt breaks or unnatural stretching. The material should retain a sense of continuity between cloth and glass, with appropriate shading and highlights.",
      "question": "Is the robe seamlessly transformed into a bottle shape with smooth contours, natural lighting gradients, and no visible tears or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the real goose with a decorative goose-shaped charm, the new element must be positioned near the base of the bottle. It should resemble a stylized version of a goose but remain anatomically plausible in size and form. The attachment point should be visible and logical, avoiding floating or detached appearance.",
      "question": "Is the goose-shaped charm integrated into the base of the bottle with a visible connection point, and does it maintain proportional size and stylized but recognizable features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of engraving grapevine patterns across the bottle surface, these details must follow the curvature of the bottle and be evenly spaced. The lines should have consistent depth and clarity, resembling etched glass rather than painted-on marks. Any irregularities would suggest poor rendering.",
      "question": "Are the grapevine engravings clearly defined, following the bottle’s contour, and free from jagged edges or inconsistent line thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding cardboard packaging with classical art motifs and a matte finish, this element must surround the bottle realistically. The packaging should have visible edges, shadows, and texture consistent with cardboard, and the artwork should be sharp and properly aligned. Any warping or transparency issues would indicate artifacting.",
      "question": "Is the cardboard packaging fully enclosed around the bottle with clean edges, subtle shadows, and clear classical motifs without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying earthy tones with gold accents, the color palette must be consistent across all materials. Gold elements should appear metallic with proper highlights, while earthy tones should blend naturally with the bottle, stopper, and packaging. Inconsistent hues or flat coloring would reduce perceived quality.",
      "question": "Are the earthy tones and gold accents uniformly applied across all surfaces, with appropriate material-specific highlights and no abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
