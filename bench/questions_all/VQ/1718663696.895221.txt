Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "rendering the character in a heroic 3D illustration with an ornate blue-and-gold uniform", evaluate whether the uniform’s color, texture, and material appear consistent and natural across the entire garment. The original image shows a detailed military-style coat with gold embroidery and structured fabric. The editing must preserve the integrity of these materials without introducing unnatural sheen, inconsistent shading, or texture repetition.
Question: Does the blue-and-gold uniform maintain consistent material appearance with no visible texture artifacts, such as repeating patterns or unnatural gloss?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "highlighting the fiery staff", assess the flame effect at the top of the staff. The original image already features a flame, but the editing instruction specifies enhancement to match a heroic RPG style. This involves evaluating whether the flame appears physically plausible—its shape, glow, and interaction with light—without rendering errors like jagged edges, floating particles, or unnatural color gradients.
Question: Is the flame atop the staff rendered with smooth gradients and realistic lighting, showing no jagged edges or artificial-looking particles?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "adding stat bars: [Leadership +10], [Valor +9], [Wisdom +8], [Fire Mastery +10]", determine whether these elements are integrated into the image without disrupting the visual flow or introducing pixelation, misalignment, or inconsistent font styles. These digital overlays must appear as if part of the card design, not pasted on.
Question: Are the stat bars positioned clearly and legibly, with clean text and no blurring or distortion that suggests poor integration into the image?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "adding a title banner at the top with a crest emblem", evaluate whether the banner and crest are proportionally correct, stylistically consistent with the rest of the image, and properly aligned. The crest should not appear warped or disconnected from the banner, and the banner should not obscure key facial features.
Question: Is the title banner and crest emblem seamlessly integrated at the top of the image, with proper proportions and no visible warping or misalignment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "including a majestic battlefield backdrop with soft mountain silhouettes", assess whether the background is coherent with the foreground character. The mountains and sky should not show abrupt transitions, clipping, or mismatched depth cues. The lighting should be consistent between the character and the environment.
Question: Does the battlefield backdrop feature soft mountain silhouettes that blend naturally with the sky and do not exhibit sharp edges or inconsistent lighting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "framing the card with burnished bronze edges for a regal finish", evaluate whether the frame is evenly applied around the image, with consistent thickness and metallic texture. It should not overlap or distort the character or other elements, and its material should reflect light realistically.
Question: Are the bronze frame edges uniformly applied around the image, with no gaps, overlapping content, or unnatural reflections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q7: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "adding a nameplate at the bottom reading 'Commander of Light'", evaluate whether the nameplate is legible, stylistically consistent with the overall design, and properly anchored to the bottom of the card without cutting off parts of the character or creating visual imbalance.
Question: Is the nameplate located at the bottom of the image with clear text and no distortion or clipping of the character's lower body?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
