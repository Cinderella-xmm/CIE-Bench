Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the building into a giant mechanical golem with articulated limbs and exposed gears, evaluate whether the structural transformation maintains geometric coherence and visual plausibility. The original image features a high-rise residential building with distinct angular balconies and symmetrical windows. The editing instruction implies that these architectural elements (e.g., balconies) should become arm-like appendages. Therefore, the question focuses on whether the transformed limbs preserve natural joint articulation and avoid broken or distorted shapes.
Question: Do the arm-like appendages formed from the balconies maintain consistent proportions and smooth joints without jagged edges or unnatural bends?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing windows with glowing energy panels, assess whether the new elements integrate naturally into the structure without disrupting surface continuity or introducing artificial glows. The original windows are rectangular and evenly spaced; their replacement with glowing panels must preserve spatial alignment and avoid abrupt luminance shifts that could appear digitally added.
Question: Are the glowing panels uniformly distributed across the window positions and do they emit light in a way that blends seamlessly with the surrounding surfaces without harsh halos or pixelation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding intricate circuit patterns across the structure, evaluate whether these patterns follow logical routing paths and maintain material consistency with the building’s surface. The original facade has a beige, textured finish; overlaying circuits should not introduce unnatural textures or break the continuity of the material appearance.
Question: Do the circuit patterns run along plausible structural lines (e.g., edges, corners) and exhibit consistent thickness and color without appearing as random overlays or digital artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of reimagining angular edges as dynamic moving parts, assess whether the motion-suggested elements (such as hinges or sliding sections) appear physically plausible. The original building has sharp, static angles; transforming them into moving parts requires maintaining structural integrity and avoiding impossible mechanics like floating segments or disconnected joints.
Question: Are the dynamic parts at the edges of the building connected to the main structure through visible mechanical links, and do they follow realistic pivot points without floating or misaligned components?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of exposing internal gears within the structure, evaluate whether the gear mechanisms are placed in logical locations (e.g., joints, core areas) and match the scale of the building. The original architecture lacks mechanical details, so introduced gears must be proportionally sized and integrated without distorting adjacent elements.
Question: Are the exposed gears positioned at structural junctions and scaled appropriately relative to the building’s height and width, without appearing oversized or misaligned with surrounding features?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
