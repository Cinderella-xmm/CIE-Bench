Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of maintaining the natural pose while converting the elephant into a 3D chibi-style figurine, assess if the overall proportions and actions still appear genuine and undistorted, reflecting the authentic feeding behavior of the elephant in the original image.
Question: Does the chibi-style figurine of the elephant retain the natural grass-eating pose without introducing unnatural distortions or deformations?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of avoiding unnatural textures and maintaining fine details when converting the materials of the elephant to matte polymer clay, evaluate whether the surface texture appears genuine and smooth, keeping the original roughness and wrinkles of the elephant's skin visible.
Question: Are the textures of the elephant's skin in the figurine realistic, showing natural details without appearing overly smooth or artificial?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility between the elephant and the base, verify if the base design, with its muddy terrain and "Jungle Friend" engraving, seamlessly integrates with the figurine, avoiding visual disconnection or inconsistencies in scale and structure.
Question: Does the base design mimic a muddy terrain naturally and complement the elephant figurine without creating visible gaps or inconsistencies?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement of maintaining a product photography style composition, check if the addition of the transparent acrylic dome cover over the figurine enhances the visual quality while preserving the clarity and visibility of the figurine, ensuring that the dome does not introduce distracting reflections or distortions.
Question: Is the transparent acrylic dome over the figurine clear and does it not cause distracting reflections or distortions on the figurine or the surrounding base?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of avoiding obvious artifacts and unnatural elements during the transformation of the elephant into a 3D chibi-style figure, evaluate if there are any unexpected disruptions like missing parts, uneven lighting, or misplaced shadows that detract from the visual plausibility of the scene.
Question: Are there no noticeable artifacts, such as missing components or misplaced shadows, that disrupt the visual plausibility of the figurine scene?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
