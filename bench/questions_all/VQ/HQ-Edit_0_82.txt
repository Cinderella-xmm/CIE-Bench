Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the elderly man into a subtle line-art style while accentuating his tai chi stance, evaluate whether the line-art conversion maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows a detailed, realistic figure in a balanced pose; thus, the transition to line art must preserve anatomical accuracy and posture integrity without distorting limbs or joints.
Question: Does the line-art representation of the elderly man maintain accurate proportions and natural joint alignment in his tai chi stance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of softening colors to pastel watercolors, assess whether the color transformation across the entire image (especially on the man’s clothing and background) results in a natural gradient without abrupt transitions or unnatural hues. The original image features realistic lighting and fabric textures, so the pastel effect should not introduce artificial-looking patches or loss of material realism.
Question: Are the pastel watercolor tones applied uniformly across the scene, preserving smooth gradients and avoiding harsh edges or inconsistent color zones?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of integrating cherry blossom patterns in the background, evaluate whether these patterns are seamlessly blended with the existing environment—particularly around the tree canopy and foggy pathway—without overlapping incorrectly or appearing as floating, disconnected elements. The original background already includes flowering trees, so added blossoms must align spatially and texturally.
Question: Are the cherry blossom patterns integrated naturally into the background, maintaining depth and perspective consistency with the existing trees and mist?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding minimalistic monthly date grids that reflect the subject's balanced pose, evaluate whether the grid layout is positioned without disrupting the composition or appearing physically impossible (e.g., floating over the figure or misaligned with the ground plane). The placement must respect spatial logic and avoid intersecting the man’s body unnaturally.
Question: Are the date grids placed in a way that respects the spatial boundaries of the scene, such as being anchored to the ground or wall without overlapping the man’s body or distorting his silhouette?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the core element (the elderly man) in a balanced tai chi pose, evaluate whether the hand gesture (specifically the "OK" sign) remains anatomically correct—ensuring no extra fingers, unnatural bends, or distorted knuckles. The original image shows a clear, realistic hand position, so any stylization must preserve five fingers and ergonomic form.
Question: Does the hand forming the "OK" gesture have exactly five fingers, with natural joint curvature and no elongated, missing, or duplicated digits?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
