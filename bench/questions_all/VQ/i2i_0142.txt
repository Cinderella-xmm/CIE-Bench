Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of "maintaining the style, materials, and features that reflect the overall sense of realism and natural appearance," we should ensure that the material texture of the baseball and glove remains consistent across all three views.
Question: Do the textures and materials of the baseball and glove appear natural and consistent in all three views?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "Structural consistency and visual credibility," the dimensions of the baseball and the proportion of the glove should remain coherent in all three views without any distortions or unrealistic scaling.
Question: Are the proportions of the baseball and glove accurate and maintain their expected size relationships in all three views?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: To assess if any artifacts were introduced during the editing process, it is crucial to examine the edges and transitions between objects in the image to ensure they do not introduce unnatural artifacts.
Question: Are there any visible artifacts, such as jagged edges or unnatural blending, around the baseball or glove in all three views?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Ensuring the natural appearance requires checking the lighting and shadow effects on the baseball and glove to confirm they align with realistic light sources in the scene.
Question: Do the shadows and highlights on the baseball and glove look natural and consistent with the lighting conditions in all three views?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The requirement for "visual credibility" includes ensuring that the composition and layout of all three views convey a logical and plausible arrangement, allowing easy interpretation of the object from different angles.
Question: Does the composition and layout in each of the three views (top, side, sectional) logically represent the baseball and glove in a visually credible manner?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
