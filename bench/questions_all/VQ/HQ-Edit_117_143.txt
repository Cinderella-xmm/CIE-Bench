Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "cartoonizing the dancer’s silhouette", evaluate whether the transformation maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The cartoonization should not distort anatomical proportions or introduce unnatural line work, especially in areas like limbs, torso, and facial features. The silhouette must remain recognizable as a human figure in motion without exaggerated or broken geometry.
Question: Does the dancer's silhouette retain natural body proportions and smooth contours without distorted limbs or misshapen joints?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "enlarging the skirt's ruffles and turning them into swirling flames", assess whether the transformation of fabric into flame-like structures preserves material logic and spatial consistency. The ruffles must appear dynamic but physically plausible, with no abrupt transitions or unnatural textures that break the illusion of flowing fabric transitioning into flame.
Question: Are the ruffles of the red dress transformed into flame-like swirls with smooth gradients and consistent lighting, avoiding jagged edges or disjointed shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "adding a golden crescent moon reflection on the ground", evaluate whether the reflection is positioned correctly relative to the actual moon in the sky and whether it conforms to light behavior (e.g., shape, intensity, direction). The reflection must appear coherent with the surrounding surface texture and lighting without floating or misaligned elements.
Question: Is the golden crescent moon reflection on the ground aligned with the position of the moon in the sky and does it follow realistic light reflection patterns on the tiled surface?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "including a starry night sky border for an ethereal vibe", determine whether the border integrates naturally with the existing sky background and does not introduce visible seams, repetition, or inconsistent star distribution. The border should enhance rather than disrupt the continuity of the night sky.
Question: Does the starry night sky border blend seamlessly with the main sky background without visible edges, repeated patterns, or unnatural star clustering?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "maintaining overall authenticity and natural appearance despite stylized elements", evaluate the hand position and structure. The dancer’s raised hand must have five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, conforming to ergonomic anatomy. Any distortion, extra fingers, or unnatural bending would compromise structural credibility.
Question: Does the dancer’s raised hand show five clearly defined fingers with natural joint angles and no missing or extra digits?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
