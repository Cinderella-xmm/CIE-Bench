Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a small, ornate crown to the roasted chicken, this involves modifying the top of the chicken’s head. The crown must be proportionally sized and stylistically consistent with the whimsical storybook illustration style while maintaining visual credibility. The editing position is the upper part of the chicken’s head (where the crown would be placed). This change affects structural coherence and material realism—specifically, whether the crown appears integrated without unnatural edges or texture mismatches.
Question: Is the crown positioned on the chicken's head in a way that maintains proportional size and natural integration with the skin texture, without visible seams or unnatural lighting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding expressive, cartoonish eyes to the chicken, this involves modifying the facial area of the chicken. The eyes must be placed in anatomically plausible locations (near the head region) and should not distort the existing shape of the chicken’s head. The editing position is the front-facing side of the chicken’s head, where eyes would be added. This affects perceived authenticity—whether the eyes appear as part of the chicken’s form or as an artificial overlay.
Question: Are the cartoonish eyes placed symmetrically on the chicken's head with smooth contours and no jagged edges or misaligned shadows?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of positioning the chicken in a festive throne setting atop the plate, this involves altering the base structure beneath the chicken. The original image shows the chicken resting on lettuce on a white oval platter. The throne must be visually coherent with the table setting and not disrupt the spatial logic. The editing position is the area directly under the chicken on the plate. This affects structural consistency—whether the throne integrates naturally with the plate and surrounding elements without breaking geometric continuity.
Question: Does the throne structure beneath the chicken maintain consistent depth and alignment with the plate’s surface, without floating or overlapping inconsistencies?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding cheerful, anthropomorphic vegetables as royal attendants around the chicken, this involves introducing new characters near the chicken on the plate. These vegetables (e.g., tomatoes, lettuce) must be modified to include facial features and limbs while preserving their original shapes and textures. The editing positions are the tomatoes and lettuce surrounding the chicken. This affects material realism—whether the added features (like arms or faces) blend with the original textures without unnatural artifacts.
Question: Are the anthropomorphic features on the vegetables (such as eyes or limbs) seamlessly blended into their surfaces without visible pixelation, texture breaks, or inconsistent shading?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using vibrant colors to accentuate the festive ambiance while retaining the celebratory decor (candles, ornaments), this involves enhancing color saturation across the scene but not distorting existing elements. The editing position includes the entire table setting—especially the candles, ornaments, and greenery. This affects overall realism—whether the enhanced colors remain within plausible ranges and do not cause halos, over-saturation, or loss of detail in fine textures like pine needles or glass reflections.
Question: Are the colors of the candles, ornaments, and foliage vivid but free from oversaturation, haloing, or loss of fine detail such as pine needle tips or glass reflections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
