      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the armrests into curled horn-like structures, this evaluates whether the shape, curvature, and material of the new horns are consistent with biological plausibility and smoothly integrated into the original armrest location. The question focuses on whether the new structure maintains structural coherence and avoids distortion such as broken geometry or unnatural tapering.",
      "question": "Do the curled horn-like structures on both armrests have smooth, continuous curves without jagged edges or inconsistent thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting tufted patterns into bark-textured scales, this assesses whether the texture applied to the backrest matches the expected roughness and pattern of tree bark, and whether it aligns with the original stitching lines. It checks for unnatural repetition, blurring, or mismatched scale.",
      "question": "Are the bark-textured scales on the backrest evenly distributed, with natural variations in shape and depth, and do they follow the original contour of the sofa without tearing or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing cushions with a mossy, leafy mane, this evaluates whether the new foliage transitions naturally from the seat and backrest areas, maintaining volume and shadow consistency. It checks for flatness, unnatural layering, or abrupt boundaries between materials.",
      "question": "Does the mossy, leafy mane extend continuously from the top of the cushions, showing layered depth and natural variation in green tones, without sharp seams or floating leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding glowing emerald eyes above the center cushion, this evaluates whether the eyes are placed symmetrically, sized appropriately relative to the sofa, and emit a soft glow that interacts realistically with surrounding surfaces. It checks for unnatural brightness, halo artifacts, or misplaced positioning.",
      "question": "Are the emerald eyes positioned centrally above the middle cushion, emitting a soft, diffused glow that casts subtle shadows on the surrounding leather without harsh outlines or overexposure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of extending wooden limbs with vine-wrapped claws from beneath the sofa, this evaluates whether the limbs emerge from the correct underside location, maintain proportional thickness, and show natural wood grain and vine wrapping. It checks for floating limbs, incorrect perspective, or clipping against the floor.",
      "question": "Do the wooden limbs extend from under the front edge of the sofa, resting firmly on the carpet, with vines wrapped around clawed ends that appear structurally sound and proportionate to the sofa's size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating earth-toned surface elements with subtle mythical energy, this evaluates whether any faint glows, particle effects, or ambient lighting enhance the scene without appearing artificial or noisy. It checks for overuse of effects that disrupt realism.",
      "question": "Are there faint, localized glows or energy effects near the limbs or eyes that blend into the environment without creating visible artifacts like pixelation or unnatural color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
