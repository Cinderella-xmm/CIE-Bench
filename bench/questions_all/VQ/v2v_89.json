      "thinking_process": "Considering the sub requirement of maintaining the detailed and organic design style while creating a handbag, we need to ensure that the handbag's texture and material align with the brain sculpture's organic look. This involves checking if the handbag retains a natural appearance without introducing unnatural textures.",
      "question": "Does the handbag maintain a natural, organic texture similar to the brain sculpture without any obvious unnatural artifacts?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "To ensure structural coherence and visual plausibility, the handbag should integrate seamlessly with the brain sculpture's style. This means evaluating if the handbag's structure is consistent with the organic flow of the brain's design.",
      "question": "Is the structure of the handbag consistent with the organic flow and design of the brain sculpture, avoiding any broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The handbag should reflect the same level of detail and material quality as the brain sculpture. This involves assessing whether the handbag's fine details are preserved and if its material looks authentic within the context of the image.",
      "question": "Are the fine details and material of the handbag preserved, ensuring it looks authentic and matches the brain sculpture's material quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The handbag's placement and proportions should be visually credible and proportional to the brain sculpture. This requires checking if the handbag's size and positioning make sense relative to the brain sculpture.",
      "question": "Is the handbag proportionally and physically rational in relation to the brain sculpture, avoiding any distortion or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The overall composition and layout of the handbag should complement the brain sculpture without disrupting the visual harmony. This involves verifying if the handbag's addition maintains the image's structural consistency and visual credibility.",
      "question": "Does the addition of the handbag maintain the overall composition and layout's visual credibility, ensuring it complements the brain sculpture without disrupting the visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
