Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the figurines into a miniature Nativity scene within a glass snow globe, evaluate whether the addition of the transparent spherical enclosure (snow globe) maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows three distinct figurines standing on separate bases; inserting them into a single enclosed space requires ensuring that their proportions, positions, and spatial relationships remain physically rational and undistorted. The glass surface must appear smooth and transparent without unnatural refractions or distortions affecting the figurinesâ€™ forms.
Question: Are the three figurines positioned inside a transparent spherical enclosure with no visible warping or geometric distortion of their shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the figurines on a grassy hilltop within the snow globe, assess whether the newly added terrain beneath the figurines appears natural and consistent with the scale and material properties of the scene. The original image shows flat, dark bases under each figurine; replacing these with a grassy mound requires evaluating texture realism, color consistency, and proper integration with the figures' feet to avoid floating or unnatural grounding.
Question: Does the grassy hilltop beneath the figurines have a natural texture and color gradient, and are the figurines' feet properly grounded without gaps or floating effects?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a tiny golden star suspended above the scene, evaluate whether the placement and appearance of the star conform to physical plausibility and aesthetic balance. The star should be small enough to fit proportionally within the globe, positioned above the central figure, and rendered with metallic sheen without appearing pixelated or misaligned. Its presence must not interfere with the visibility of the figurines or create unnatural shadows.
Question: Is the golden star positioned above the central figurine, small in scale relative to the scene, and free from jagged edges or unnatural lighting artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding gentle, swirling snowflakes inside the globe, assess whether the snowflakes are evenly distributed, translucent, and follow a natural motion pattern without clumping or overlapping in ways that suggest digital artifacts. The snowflakes must not obscure key features of the figurines or appear as solid white blobs.
Question: Are the snowflakes inside the globe translucent, evenly spaced, and moving in a swirling pattern without obscuring facial features or clothing details of the figurines?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of framing the globe with an ornate wooden base featuring engraved patterns and an inscription "Peace and Hope", evaluate whether the base is structurally coherent, matches the scale of the globe, and displays clear, legible text and intricate engraving without blurring or misalignment. The wood texture should appear realistic with grain patterns and depth.
Question: Does the wooden base surrounding the globe display consistent wood grain texture, clear engraved patterns, and legible inscription "Peace and Hope" without distortion or blur?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
