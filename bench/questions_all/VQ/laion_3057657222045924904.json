      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a transparent acrylic display case around the McLaren, this question evaluates whether the case's transparency introduces visual artifacts such as unnatural distortion, double imaging, or inconsistent reflections. The case must allow full visibility of the car without warping its shape or altering its surface appearance due to refraction effects.",
      "question": "Does the transparent acrylic display case show no visible distortion, reflection anomalies, or refraction errors that affect the appearance of the McLaren?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the black circular platform with a polished chrome base, this question checks whether the new base matches the scale and positioning of the original platform, and whether it exhibits realistic metallic reflections and surface continuity without floating or misalignment.",
      "question": "Is the polished chrome base aligned with the car's position and does it reflect light and surroundings naturally without appearing disconnected or distorted?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying carbon fiber textures on the interior walls of the display case, this question assesses whether the texture is applied uniformly and realistically within the case, without extending beyond boundaries or showing repetition or unnatural grain patterns.",
      "question": "Are the carbon fiber textures confined to the interior walls of the display case and do they exhibit consistent, non-repeating patterns without visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a miniature toolset inside the display case, this question evaluates whether the tools are scaled correctly relative to the car, placed in a plausible arrangement, and rendered with natural metallic surfaces and shadows.",
      "question": "Are the miniature wrenches and screwdrivers proportionally accurate compared to the McLaren and positioned in a way that suggests intentional placement without floating or clipping through surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a laser-etched cityscape silhouette around the car, this question checks whether the silhouette is properly layered behind the car and display case, maintains clean edges, and does not intersect incorrectly with other elements.",
      "question": "Is the laser-etched cityscape silhouette positioned at a consistent depth behind the car and display case, with no overlapping or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
