Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of ensuring the overall realism and natural appearance when making the right-side skier appear to "slide out" of the image, we need to check if the 3D effect introduces unnatural textures or affects the skier's appearance.
Question: Does the right-side skier maintain a natural texture and appearance without visible artifacts where he appears to slide out of the image? 
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the structural consistency and visual credibility, we need to ensure that the sliding effect does not distort the skierâ€™s shape or proportions.
Question: Are the geometric shapes of the right-side skier's body and equipment preserved, avoiding any distortion or unnatural bending in the sliding effect? 
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: To evaluate the visual plausibility and ensure the skier's shadow reflects a realistic interaction with the snowy environment after the edit.
Question: Does the shadow cast by the right-side skier remain consistent with the light source and appear naturally elongated or altered appropriately due to the sliding effect? 
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the absence of obvious artifacts, we should check if the background snow and its interaction with the skier appear undisturbed by the edit.
Question: Is the snow texture around the right-side skier smooth and uninterrupted, without showing signs of unnatural blending or disruption from the sliding effect?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: To confirm that the edits do not degrade the fine details, we should examine the clarity of the skier's features and equipment.
Question: Do the details on the right-side skier's clothing, ski poles, and skis remain sharp and clear, without any blurring or loss of detail due to the sliding effect?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
