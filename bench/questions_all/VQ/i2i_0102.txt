Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement to add the handwritten word "Draft" on the yellow paper while maintaining overall realism and natural appearance, we need to assess if the addition of text introduces any unnatural artifacts or disrupts the scene's coherence. This involves checking whether the texture and color of the handwriting blend naturally with the yellow paper.
Question: Does the handwritten word "Draft" on the yellow paper appear seamlessly integrated without unnatural textures or color discrepancies?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: To ensure the maintained style and materials of the added handwriting reflect reality, one should evaluate if the style of "Draft" matches what would typically be expected from a design sketch. This includes assessing whether the handwriting appears plausible given the context of the pencil and paper in the image.
Question: Is the style and material of the handwritten word "Draft" visually consistent with the pencil used in the image and typical design sketches?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: The core element here is ensuring the structural consistency and visual credibility of the yellow paper after adding the "Draft" text. This involves checking if the addition of text has caused any distortion to the paperâ€™s shape or introduced errors in alignment and spacing.
Question: Has the addition of the handwritten word "Draft" preserved the structural integrity of the yellow paper, avoiding any distortion or misalignment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the avoidance of introducing artifacts and loss of detail, we assess whether the edges of the handwritten word "Draft" maintain clarity and sharpness. This ensures that the fine details of both the text and the surrounding paper remain intact and undistorted.
Question: Are the edges of the handwritten word "Draft" sharp and clear, without introducing any unnatural blurring or pixelation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The physical rationality of the elements, especially the pencil and the paper, should be preserved even after adding the "Draft" text. This involves ensuring that the interaction between the pencil tip and the yellow paper remains logically consistent and physically believable.
Question: Does the positioning of the pencil on the yellow paper remain physically logical and visually credible after adding the handwritten word "Draft"?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
