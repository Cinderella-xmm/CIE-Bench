      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying bold outlines across all major elements without distorting their original shapes, this question evaluates whether the outlines accurately follow the contours of the player, basketball, hoop, and court. Misaligned or jagged outlines could break the illusion of form and reduce visual credibility.",
      "question": "Do the bold outlines precisely trace the edges of the player, basketball, hoop, and court without overlapping or cutting into the underlying forms?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding dynamic action lines to suggest motion, this question checks if the lines are placed along plausible directions of movement (e.g., trailing behind the player and ball) and do not pass through solid objects or contradict physics.",
      "question": "Are the dynamic action lines positioned along the direction of motion and do they avoid intersecting solid objects like the player’s body or the basketball?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enhancing colors with vibrant red and orange hues, this question assesses whether the color saturation remains within natural limits and preserves texture details in skin, jersey, and court materials.",
      "question": "Are the red and orange hues applied consistently across the image without causing visible color bleeding, banding, or loss of detail in areas such as the jersey fabric, skin tone, or wooden floor?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing retro-inspired text overlays, this question evaluates whether the text is readable, properly spaced, and does not obstruct critical visual elements like the player’s face or the basketball.",
      "question": "Is the text overlay clearly legible, positioned outside the main subject area, and not covering any essential part of the player or basketball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question": "Is the comic panel border evenly drawn around the entire image, maintaining consistent thickness and not cropping any part of the player, hoop, or background?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving structural consistency in the player’s pose and interaction with the basketball, this question focuses on the anatomical accuracy of the hand gripping the ball—specifically finger count, spacing, and contact points.",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the basketball have exactly five fingers, correctly proportioned and naturally curved around the ball, with no extra digits or unnatural gaps?",

      "question": "Is the basketball fully spherical with visible seam lines and no flattened or distorted regions despite the comic-style rendering?",
