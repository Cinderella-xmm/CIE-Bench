      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the lanterns into colorful balloons, this involves replacing the existing orange paper lanterns hanging along both sides of the alley with balloons. The editing position is the entire row of lanterns from the foreground to the background on both sides. This transformation affects overall realism and natural appearance because balloons differ significantly in material, shape, and lighting behavior from traditional paper lanterns. The question evaluates whether the new balloon elements maintain plausible physical properties such as consistent shape, surface texture (e.g., smooth rubber-like), and proper lighting interaction (soft shadows, reflections) without introducing unnatural textures or artifacts.",
      "question": "Are the transformed lanterns now depicted as balloons with consistent spherical shapes, smooth surfaces, and realistic lighting effects that match their surrounding environment?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of exaggerating the kimono’s patterns with flowing designs in brighter hues, the editing target is the girl's kimono, particularly the fabric pattern across the sleeves, torso, and hem. This modification alters color saturation and pattern flow, which may affect visual credibility if not rendered with coherent textile texture and proportionality. The question checks whether the enhanced colors and patterns remain physically plausible for a fabric material—specifically, whether there are no unnatural distortions, pixelation, or inconsistent brushstroke-like artifacts in the design.",
      "question": "Do the exaggerated patterns on the kimono display continuous, flowing designs with consistent texture and color gradients that resemble real fabric without visible digital artifacts or breaks in pattern continuity?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering the girl in cartoon style, this involves stylizing her facial features, proportions, and body structure. The editing position includes her face, limbs, and overall silhouette. Cartoon styles often involve simplified forms and larger eyes, but excessive distortion can compromise structural consistency and visual plausibility. This question evaluates whether her facial features (especially eyes, nose, mouth) and body proportions remain within acceptable ergonomic limits and avoid unnatural elongation or deformation.",
      "question": "Does the girl’s face retain anatomically plausible proportions, including correctly shaped eyes, nose, and mouth, with no signs of stretching, misalignment, or incorrect number of fingers on her hands?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding detachable sections for short personal messages at the bottom of the postcard, the editing position is the lower edge of the image, where a new layer or section is introduced. This addition must integrate seamlessly with the rest of the composition without disrupting perspective or depth cues. The question assesses whether the message area appears as a natural extension of the card format, with clean edges, consistent lighting, and no floating or misaligned elements.",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of setting card titles in bold, traditional fonts, the editing position includes text overlays likely placed near the top or side margins of the postcard. These text elements must be legible, stylistically appropriate, and integrated without overlapping key visual elements like the girl or lanterns. The question evaluates whether the font style matches traditional aesthetics (e.g., calligraphic or kanji-based), has uniform stroke weight, and does not introduce jagged edges or blurring due to low resolution or poor rendering.",
      "question": "Are the title texts rendered in a bold, traditional-style font with clear strokes, proper spacing, and no visible aliasing or distortion that would suggest poor integration into the image?",
