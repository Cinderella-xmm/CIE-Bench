Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the two blonde dolls into subjects of a Japanese Ukiyo-e woodblock print while maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility, we need to assess if the bold calligraphic outlines and flat planes of color for their clothing and hair appear natural and consistent with the original doll positions.
Question: Do the bold calligraphic outlines and flat planes of color on the dolls' clothing and hair maintain the original proportions and positions without introducing unnatural distortions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of ensuring the absence of obvious artifacts and unnatural textures during the transformation, we need to evaluate if the texture of the dolls' skin and hair remains natural after applying the Ukiyo-e style.
Question: Are the textures of the dolls' skin and hair free from unnatural artifacts and maintain a natural appearance after the style transformation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement of avoiding distortion such as damaged geometric shapes, we need to check if the dolls' limbs and facial features retain their structural integrity and do not appear deformed.
Question: Do the dolls' limbs and facial features retain their structural integrity and do not appear deformed after the style transformation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: To ensure the maintained style reflects the overall sense of reality and natural appearance, we need to verify if the simplified background complements the dolls without disrupting the visual flow.
Question: Does the subtly patterned, simplified background complement the dolls without disrupting the visual flow and maintaining the overall sense of reality?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the sub requirement of retaining core elements to ensure structural consistency and visual credibility, we need to confirm if the dolls' poses and expressions remain coherent with the original scene.
Question: Do the dolls' poses and expressions remain coherent with the original scene and contribute to the visual credibility of the Ukiyo-e style?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
