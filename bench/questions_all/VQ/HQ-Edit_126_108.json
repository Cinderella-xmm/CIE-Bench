      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the waterfall into a water elemental creature with fluid limbs, this question evaluates whether the newly formed arms and legs of water maintain natural fluid dynamics. The limbs must emerge from the cascade in a way that respects gravity and water flow, avoiding abrupt transitions or unnatural bends. The presence of defined limbs should not disrupt the continuity of the falling water or introduce visible seams or gaps.",
      "question": "Do the cascading arms and legs of the water elemental follow natural water flow patterns without abrupt breaks or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding amethyst-like crystalline textures to the cliff faces, this question checks whether the crystal formations are embedded realistically into the rock surface. The texture should vary in size and orientation, mimicking natural mineral growth, and not appear as uniform, repeating patterns. The color and transparency should match the ambient lighting and not stand out as overly saturated or artificial.",
      "question": "Are the crystalline textures on the cliff faces varied in shape and size, and do they appear embedded within the rock rather than overlaid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding glowing azure magical patterns to the cliff faces, this question assesses whether the glow interacts realistically with the environment. The light should diffuse softly, cast faint shadows, and reflect subtly on nearby surfaces like water or mist. It should not appear as a flat, bright overlay or cause unnatural highlights.",
      "question": "Does the glowing azure pattern emit a soft, diffused light that interacts with the surrounding rock and water without harsh edges or over-bright spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the forest canopy into a flowing crown of mist and leaves, this question evaluates the transition between solid foliage and ethereal elements. The mist and leaves should appear to drift naturally, with proper depth and layering, and should not float independently of the terrain. The crown must remain connected to the tree line and respond to environmental cues like wind direction.",
      "question": "Does the mist and leaf crown transition smoothly from the solid canopy and appear anchored to the landscape with consistent depth and motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding whirlpool-like eyes to the water elemental, this question examines whether the eyes are positioned plausibly within the waterfall structure and exhibit realistic vortex behavior. The whirlpools should have spiral gradients, reflective highlights, and a sense of depth, without appearing flat or misshapen. Their size and location should not distort the surrounding water flow.",
      "question": "Are the whirlpool eyes properly sized, located in a logical position within the waterfall, and do they show realistic spiral motion and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
