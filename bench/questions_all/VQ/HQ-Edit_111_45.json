      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a golden halo around the central blacksmith’s head, this element must be visually integrated without disrupting the facial features or causing unnatural light effects. The halo should emit soft, consistent radiance without sharp edges or overlapping textures that suggest digital artifacting. This affects the perceived authenticity and natural appearance of the saintly figure.",
      "question": "Is the golden halo around the blacksmith’s head smoothly rendered with even luminosity and no jagged edges or visible seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The replacement of the original apron and robe with flowing medieval garments involves altering fabric behavior and texture. The new robes must drape realistically over the body, maintaining continuity in folds and material thickness. Any floating, stretched, or disconnected areas would compromise structural coherence and visual credibility.",
      "question": "Do the flowing robes on the central figure show natural fabric folds and consistent material texture without unnatural stretching or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The transformation of the hammer and tongs into divine instruments requires retaining their functional form while stylizing them. The tools must remain identifiable as hammers and tongs, but with embellished designs. If the shapes are distorted—such as elongated handles or missing parts—it could break physical rationality and reduce visual plausibility.",
      "question": "Are the divine instruments held by the blacksmith clearly derived from the original hammer and tongs, with preserved proportions and no geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The forge is being stylized into an ethereal furnace with glowing embers. The internal fire must appear dynamic yet coherent, with proper heat glow extending outward. The brickwork should remain intact, and the glow should not bleed unnaturally into adjacent areas. This ensures the scene maintains visual credibility despite stylistic changes.",
      "question": "Does the glowing interior of the forge emit consistent radiant light without excessive bloom, pixelation, or irregular ember patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The addition of entwining vine borders and calligraphy along the image edges must align with the manuscript aesthetic. These elements must follow the frame smoothly, avoid intersecting critical components like the anvil or figure, and maintain uniform line quality. Misalignment or clipping would indicate poor integration.",
      "question": "Are the vine borders and calligraphy evenly distributed along the image edges without overlapping or obscuring the main subject or tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The hands of the central figure are manipulating tools; therefore, their anatomy must be accurate. Each hand must have five fingers with natural curvature, proper joint angles, and skin texture. Any extra digits, fused fingers, or unnatural bending would violate ergonomic principles and degrade perceived realism.",
      "question": "Do both hands of the blacksmith display anatomically correct five-fingered grips with natural joint alignment and no deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
