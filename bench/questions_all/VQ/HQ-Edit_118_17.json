      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"encasing the stave church in a detailed glass display case,\" evaluate whether the addition of the glass enclosure maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The glass should appear transparent with reflections and refractions consistent with real glass, and its edges must align precisely with the church’s base without distorting the building's geometry or introducing unnatural textures.",
      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the stave church have clear, smooth surfaces with realistic reflections and no visible distortion or warping of the church beneath it?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding layered, wispy clouds on the background panel,\" assess whether the cloud layering appears natural and consistent with atmospheric depth. The clouds should not obscure key elements like the mountain backdrop or appear unnaturally flat or pixelated, and their placement should not interfere with the perceived distance between the church and the mountains.",
      "question": "Are the layered clouds in the background panel translucent and softly blended, showing depth without blocking or distorting the mountain range behind them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"sculpting tiny coniferous trees around the base,\" evaluate whether the added miniature trees are proportionally correct relative to the church and the surrounding terrain. They should match the style and scale of the existing forested environment and not appear misaligned, duplicated, or unnaturally clustered.",
      "question": "Are the small coniferous trees near the base of the church properly scaled, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the larger trees in the surrounding forest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"utilizing a muted color scheme for the mountain backdrop,\" assess whether the color tones of the mountains and sky are harmonized and subdued, enhancing the vintage architectural feel without introducing abrupt contrasts or unnatural hues that would break visual continuity.",
      "question": "Do the mountains and sky in the background use a consistent muted palette that complements the dark wood tones of the church without creating jarring color transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"incorporating faint footprint imprints on a simulated snowy surface path leading to the church,\" evaluate whether the footprints are realistically rendered—small, shallow, and aligned along a plausible walking path—and whether the snow texture is consistent with the surrounding terrain and lighting conditions.",
      "question": "Are the footprints on the snowy path subtle, evenly spaced, and aligned toward the entrance of the church, without appearing artificial or overly pronounced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
