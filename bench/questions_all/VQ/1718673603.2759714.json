      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the Japanese house's structure with colored glass panels framed by black lead, evaluate whether the architectural elements (such as roof, walls, windows, and pillars) have been transformed into stained glass style while maintaining structural coherence. Focus on whether the geometric shapes of the building remain intact and proportionally consistent after conversion, and whether the black lead framing appears uniform and logically follows the original architecture’s lines.",
      "question": "Are the roof, walls, and window frames of the Japanese house replaced with colored glass panels outlined by black lead without distorting the original building’s geometry or introducing misaligned or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming red trees into floral motifs composed of red and green segments, assess whether the tree forms have been stylized into flower-like patterns using segmented colored glass, while preserving their spatial position and size relative to the house. Check if the transition from natural tree shape to abstract floral design is coherent and visually plausible within the stained glass aesthetic.",
      "question": "Have the red trees on both sides of the house been converted into symmetrical floral motifs made of red and green glass segments that maintain their original placement and scale without unnatural stretching or fragmentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of depicting the large red moon with gradient circles, examine whether the moon has been rendered using layered circular gradients in varying shades of red, resembling stained glass, and whether it retains its central position in the sky and proper size relative to the house. Evaluate if the gradient transitions are smooth and free from pixelation or sharp edges that suggest digital artifacts.",
      "question": "Is the red moon represented as a series of concentric gradient circles in stained glass style, with smooth color transitions and no jagged edges or irregularities in its form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of emphasizing line detailing in the stained glass style, evaluate whether fine lines such as those separating glass panes, outlining architectural features, and defining floral patterns are consistently present, sharp, and evenly spaced. Assess whether these lines appear artificially thickened or distorted, which could compromise the visual credibility of the stained glass effect.",
      "question": "Are all structural and decorative lines—such as those framing glass panels, outlining windows, and defining floral motifs—uniform, continuous, and properly aligned without breaks, overlaps, or uneven thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring the overall scene maintains visual plausibility under the stained glass transformation, check whether reflections in the water below the house and trees show accurate representation of the stained glass elements. Specifically, verify if the reflection includes the same colored glass panels, floral motifs, and gradient moon, with proper symmetry and clarity, avoiding ghosting or mismatched colors.",
      "question": "Do the reflections in the water accurately mirror the stained glass version of the house, red floral trees, and red moon with correct proportions, alignment, and color fidelity, without distortion or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
