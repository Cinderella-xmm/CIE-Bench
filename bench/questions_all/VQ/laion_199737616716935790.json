      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the motorcycle into a LEGO model using black and blue bricks, evaluate whether the brick-like texture applied to the body panels maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows smooth surfaces with sharp edges; converting these to LEGO bricks must preserve angular geometry without introducing warped or misaligned block patterns.",
      "question": "Are the black and blue brick textures on the motorcycle body panels uniformly aligned and geometrically consistent with the original angular design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing wheel rims with intricate cog patterns, assess whether the new rim design adheres to physical logic and maintains proportional scale relative to the rest of the wheel. The original rims are spoked and circular; replacing them with cogs must retain circular symmetry and avoid distorted teeth or irregular spacing.",
      "question": "Do the cog-patterned rims maintain circular shape and evenly spaced teeth that match the wheel diameter and do not appear stretched or broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using colorful decals as printed tile elements, determine whether the decals are integrated naturally into the LEGO brick surface without floating or misaligned edges. In the original image, decals are smoothly applied; in the edited version, they should appear as part of the brick surface, not as overlays.",
      "question": "Are the colorful decals seamlessly embedded into the brick surface, showing no visible gaps, overlaps, or unnatural layering effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of mounting the model on a smooth gray baseplate with directional arrows, evaluate whether the baseplate appears physically stable and proportionally scaled beneath the motorcycle. The baseplate must be flat, uniform in color, and correctly positioned under the wheels without floating or clipping issues.",
      "question": "Is the gray baseplate flat, continuous, and properly supporting the motorcycleâ€™s wheels without any visible elevation mismatch or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of positioning the model in a clean display case for impact, assess whether the display case has transparent walls, even lighting, and no visual artifacts such as reflections, shadows, or clipping. The original image has a plain background; the display case must not introduce unnatural depth cues or distortions.",
      "question": "Does the display case have clear, undistorted boundaries with no ghosting, refraction errors, or unintended shadows affecting the motorcycle's appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
