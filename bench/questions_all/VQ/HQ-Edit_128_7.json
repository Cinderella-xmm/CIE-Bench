      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the church into an ethereal magical tower with swirling cloud-like structures, evaluate whether the structural transformation maintains geometric coherence and visual plausibility. The original image features a multi-tiered wooden stave church with clearly defined rooflines and gables; replacing these with cloud-like forms must preserve spatial logic and avoid distorted or broken shapes. The question focuses on the shape and structural integrity of the new cloud-like elements added to the tower’s form.",
      "question": "Do the swirling cloud-like structures integrated into the tower maintain consistent geometric continuity without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding luminescent runes along the wooden patterns, assess whether the runes are seamlessly embedded into the wood texture without disrupting material consistency. The original image shows intricate carvings on the wooden surfaces, so any added glowing runes must align with the grain and depth of the wood, avoiding floating or misplaced light effects that suggest digital artifacts.",
      "question": "Are the luminescent runes aligned with the wood grain and carving details, and do they emit light without creating unnatural halos or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the roof with shimmering crystal spires, evaluate whether the new material (crystal) is visually coherent with the structure’s geometry and lighting conditions. The original roof is made of layered shingles with matte texture; replacing it with crystalline material must respect physical reflection and refraction properties, avoiding flat or overly shiny textures that appear artificial.",
      "question": "Do the shimmering crystal spires reflect light naturally, showing subtle variations in transparency and surface highlights consistent with real crystal under daylight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adorning the spire tops with glowing celestial orbs, assess whether the orbs are proportionally sized and positioned at the apexes of the spires without distorting the surrounding architecture. The original spire has a pointed finial; replacing it with a glowing orb must preserve vertical alignment and avoid floating or misaligned placement that disrupts structural balance.",
      "question": "Are the glowing celestial orbs centered and securely attached to the tips of the spires, maintaining proportional scale and alignment with the architectural axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting trees into mystical silver spirals, evaluate whether the transformed trees retain natural plant-like volume and spatial relationships with the ground and sky. The original image includes coniferous trees with realistic foliage density; turning them into spirals must preserve their upright posture and avoid flat or wireframe-like appearances that lack depth.",
      "question": "Do the silver spiral trees maintain three-dimensional volume and proper shadowing, appearing solid rather than transparent or two-dimensional?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of creating ghostly bird apparitions circling the tower, assess whether the birds are rendered with soft translucency and motion blur appropriate for ethereal beings. The original image shows clear white birds in flight; the ghostly versions must differ in opacity and edge definition while remaining distinguishable as birds, avoiding blurry smudges or disconnected limbs.",
      "question": "Are the ghostly bird apparitions semi-transparent with smooth feather outlines and consistent motion direction, without fragmented or duplicated body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
