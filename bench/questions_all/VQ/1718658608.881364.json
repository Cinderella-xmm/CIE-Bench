      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the octopus into ceramic sculptures with a glossy finish, this question evaluates whether the material transformation has been applied consistently across all tentacles and the head, ensuring that the glossy surface reflects light in a way that matches the ambient lighting (sunset glow). It checks for unnatural shine, inconsistent highlights, or areas where the gloss appears artificially added.",
      "question": "Do the ceramic sculptures exhibit a uniform glossy finish with realistic reflections that align with the direction and intensity of the sunset light?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the original skin texture with textured scales mimicking the original skin, this question examines whether the new scale texture is seamlessly integrated into the sculpture surface, avoiding repetitive patterns or unnatural edges that might indicate low-resolution texturing or tiling artifacts.",
      "question": "Are the textured scales evenly distributed across the sculpture surfaces without visible repetition, distortion, or sharp edges suggesting digital artifacting?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the color to deep oceanic blues, this question checks whether the blue tones are consistent with the intended aesthetic and do not conflict with the surrounding environment (e.g., sky, water, sand), particularly in terms of chromatic harmony and saturation.",
      "question": "Is the deep oceanic blue coloration of the sculptures consistent across all parts and harmonious with the surrounding ocean and sky colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the sculptures against a smooth, sandy-colored background, this question evaluates whether the background has been uniformly changed to a sandy tone and whether there are any abrupt transitions or remnants of the original sea or landscape elements that compromise visual continuity.",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly sandy-colored with no visible traces of the original ocean, waves, or shoreline elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of arranging the sculptures in a wave-like pattern that echoes the original ocean scene, this question assesses whether the spatial arrangement of the sculptures follows a natural, flowing curve that mimics wave motion and maintains structural coherence without unnatural gaps or misalignments.",
      "question": "Are the sculptures arranged in a continuous, flowing wave pattern that matches the curvature and rhythm of the original ocean waves in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
