      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the individual’s hair into large, intricately styled curls typical of Baroque fashion, evaluate whether the hair volume, curl structure, and placement maintain geometric coherence and natural flow without unnatural stretching or breaking of strands. The original image shows a well-defined powdered wig with balanced curls; any exaggeration must preserve plausible hair physics.",
      "question": "Does the hair exhibit consistent curl patterns and volumetric continuity without visible distortions such as broken strands, unnatural bulges, or abrupt changes in thickness?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering the costume with a vibrant red coat adorned with golden embroidery, assess whether the texture of the fabric appears smooth and consistent with velvet-like material, and whether the gold embroidery follows logical ornamental patterns without pixelation or irregular spacing. The original image shows detailed embroidery; any enhancement must retain fine detail and structural integrity.",
      "question": "Are the golden embroidery patterns evenly spaced and continuous along the red coat, with no jagged edges or missing segments that suggest artifacting?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a striking blue sash across the torso, evaluate whether the sash's shape conforms to physical draping logic—specifically, whether it folds naturally over the shoulder and chest without floating or intersecting unnaturally with other elements like the collar or coat. The original image has a clear diagonal sash; its transformation must preserve realistic fabric behavior.",
      "question": "Does the blue sash follow a smooth, gravity-consistent drape from the shoulder to the waist without unnatural creases or overlapping inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of creating a 3D figurine effect with polished, smooth textures, assess whether the surface of the clothing and skin exhibits uniform lighting and reflection consistent with a three-dimensional form, avoiding flatness or unnatural glossiness. The original image is two-dimensional; the conversion must simulate depth without introducing artificial highlights or shadow mismatches.",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the coat, sash, and skin show coherent shading and specular reflections that align with a single light source, avoiding inconsistent gloss or floating highlights?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining historical charm through authentic costume details, evaluate whether the white lace cravat remains structurally intact and proportionally correct relative to the neck and collar, ensuring no warping or misalignment that would break visual credibility. The original image shows a delicate ruffled cravat; its preservation is critical for authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the white lace cravat properly aligned with the neck and collar, with no distortion, clipping, or unnatural stretching of the lace pattern?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
