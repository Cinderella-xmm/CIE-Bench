      "question": "Are the chibi-style 3D models of the sheep and clock free from unnatural textures and maintain their fine details?",

      "thinking_process": "Considering the sub requirement of maintaining the structural consistency and visual credibility of the sheep casually leaning against the clock, we need to evaluate if the interaction between the sheep and clock appears natural and plausible within the context of the snow globe.",
      "question": "Does the sheep appear naturally leaning against the clock without any distortion or unnatural positioning?",

      "thinking_process": "According to the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts and ensuring the overall realism and natural appearance, we need to check if the addition of gently drifting snowflakes inside the snow globe enhances the scene without disrupting the visual quality.",
      "question": "Do the gently drifting snowflakes inside the snow globe add to the scene naturally without introducing any obvious artifacts?",

      "thinking_process": "Given the sub requirement of ensuring the proportion and physical rationality of each element avoid distortion such as damaged geometric shapes, we need to confirm if the snow globe structure and its contents maintain proper proportions and physical logic.",
