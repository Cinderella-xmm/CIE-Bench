      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding monochrome line-drawing overlays for labeled anatomical parts (antennae, wings, abdomen, thorax), evaluate whether these added elements are correctly positioned over the corresponding butterfly body parts without distorting or misaligning with the original structure. The placement must maintain structural coherence and avoid unnatural intersections or overlaps that would compromise visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are the monochrome line-drawings for the antennae, wings, abdomen, and thorax accurately aligned with the actual anatomy of the butterfly and do they follow its natural contours without overlapping incorrectly or creating geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating botanical details such as pink petals to indicate feeding preference, assess whether the added petal elements integrate naturally with the existing floral environment in terms of color, texture, and lighting. The addition should not introduce inconsistent shading or unnatural edges that break the scene's realism.",
      "question": "Do the added pink petals appear seamlessly integrated into the surrounding flora with consistent lighting, texture, and shadow alignment, avoiding any visible seams or artificial edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of including text boxes outlining ecological roles in pollination, evaluate whether these text boxes are placed in a way that does not obscure critical visual elements like the butterfly or flowers, and whether their design (font, size, contrast) maintains legibility without disrupting the delicate visual theme.",
      "question": "Are the text boxes positioned in non-obtrusive areas of the image, clearly readable, and visually balanced so they do not interfere with the butterfly or floral elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the butterfly’s striking blue color as a focal point while adding overlays, assess whether the original vibrant blue wing color remains intact and unaltered by the editing process, especially around areas where line drawings are superimposed. Any fading, blurring, or color bleeding would degrade perceived authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the vibrant blue color of the butterfly’s wings preserved uniformly across all areas, including under and around the overlaid anatomical lines, without any visible discoloration or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving natural appearance and avoiding artifacts during editing, evaluate whether the integration of new elements (line drawings, text boxes, petal additions) introduces any unnatural textures, jagged edges, or digital artifacts such as pixelation, ghosting, or noise that detract from overall perceptual quality.",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, pixelation, or unnatural textures in the areas where edits were made (e.g., line drawings, text boxes, added petals)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
