Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility while replacing the painting with a digital display screen, itâ€™s important to ensure that the new display screen fits well into the space originally occupied by the painting.
Question: Does the digital display screen appear to fit seamlessly within the rectangular frame previously occupied by the painting, maintaining the same proportions and alignment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: To evaluate whether the maintained style, materials, and other features contribute to the overall sense of reality and natural appearance, we need to assess if the digital display screen looks appropriately integrated in terms of texture and lighting compared to the rest of the room.
Question: Is the texture and surface finish of the digital display screen consistent with the surrounding wall, ensuring it does not introduce any unnatural artifacts or discrepancies in material?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the avoidance of introducing artifacts such as unnatural textures and loss of details, we must ensure that any new elements introduced do not degrade the fine details of the existing room setup.
Question: Are all the details around the digital display screen, such as the wall edges and the flooring, preserved without any visible distortion or loss of detail?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: To maintain proportion and physical rationality, the digital display screen should not distort the overall composition of the room.
Question: Does the digital display screen preserve the balance and symmetry of the room, with the armchairs still appearing naturally aligned relative to the new display screen?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The replacement of the painting should not affect the overall realism and natural appearance of the scene, particularly considering the lighting and shadow effects.
Question: Do the shadows and light reflections cast by the digital display screen match those expected from a wall-mounted object, without creating unrealistic or conflicting lighting patterns?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
