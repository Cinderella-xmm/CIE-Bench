      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the woven texture of the handbag into scales, this involves a material and texture transformation that must maintain structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows a tightly woven, ridged texture on the bag’s body. The editing instruction requires replacing this with a scaly pattern, which must align with the bag’s curvature and not introduce unnatural breaks or inconsistent scale patterns. The question evaluates whether the new texture maintains continuity, proportionality, and natural appearance without visible artifacts.",
      "question": "Does the transformed woven surface of the handbag display a consistent, seamless scale pattern that follows the bag's contours without visible distortions or gaps?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of altering the gray ribbons into elegant wings, this involves reshaping existing elements into a new form. The original ribbons are large, flat bows attached to the front of the bag. Converting them into wing-like structures requires maintaining their placement while modifying shape and flow. The evaluation focuses on whether the wings appear structurally plausible—such as having proper symmetry, natural curvature, and material consistency—and whether they retain the ribbon’s fabric quality without introducing unnatural folds or tears.",
      "question": "Are the modified gray ribbons shaped into wings with smooth, symmetrical curves and natural fabric draping that match the original material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of turning the white flowers into eyes surrounded by ornate lashes, this involves reinterpreting floral elements as facial features. The original flowers are positioned at the center of the bows. Transforming them into eyes requires adding eyelashes and ensuring the flower petals resemble irises or pupils. The evaluation checks whether the added lashes are proportionally balanced, evenly spaced, and integrated naturally into the flower structure without appearing pasted or distorted.",
      "question": "Do the white flowers have added eyelash-like details that are evenly distributed and seamlessly blended into the petal edges without breaking the flower’s natural shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding delicate, sparkling antennas near the handle, this involves inserting new elements into an empty space. The original handle is clean and unadorned. Adding antennas must preserve spatial logic—ensuring they emerge naturally from the top of the handle without clipping into it or floating unnaturally. The evaluation focuses on whether the antennas are properly anchored, have realistic sparkle effects (without over-saturation), and maintain proportional size relative to the bag.",
      "question": "Are the added antennas positioned near the top of the handle with a clear point of attachment and do they exhibit subtle sparkle effects without overlapping or distorting surrounding areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the chain into a serpentine tail that curls beneath the bag, this involves reshaping a rigid metallic object into a flexible, organic form. The original chain hangs vertically from the side. Transforming it into a tail requires bending it into a flowing curve under the bag. The evaluation checks whether the tail maintains metal-like texture, avoids unnatural kinks or breaks, and lies in a physically plausible position beneath the bag without intersecting its base or appearing suspended.",
      "question": "Is the modified chain forming a continuous, curved tail underneath the bag that retains metallic texture and does not intersect or float above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
