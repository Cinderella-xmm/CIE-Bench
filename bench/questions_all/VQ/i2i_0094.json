      "thinking_process": "The editing task requires converting the realistic camera into a steampunk illustration style while retaining its structural coherence. Considering the body of the camera, including its texture and detailing, it's important to verify if the metallic textures added during editing preserve the natural appearance without introducing unnatural artifacts or losing fine details.",
      "question": "Are the metallic textures added to the camera body natural, maintaining the camera's structural coherence without visible artifacts or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The lens of the camera serves as a focal point in the image. For the steampunk illustration style, the lens should exhibit appropriate metallic textures while preserving its original geometric shape and proportion. Thus, assessing the authenticity of the lens design after editing is crucial.",
      "question": "Does the lens maintain its original proportions and geometric shape, with metallic textures that appear authentic and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The tripod stand is an integral part of the image and needs to retain its visual credibility post-edit. Ensuring that the metallic textures applied do not disrupt the structural consistency and natural appearance of the tripod is vital.",
      "question": "Do the tripod legs and head display metallic textures that are consistent with their original structure, avoiding damage to geometry or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The Nikon logo and other text labels on the camera must remain visually coherent and legible even in the steampunk illustration style. Any alteration to these elements should enhance rather than detract from the overall authenticity.",
      "question": "Are the Nikon logo and other text labels naturally integrated into the metallic design, remaining legible and consistent with the steampunk style without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The overall composition after editing should present a harmonious blend of steampunk elements with the original photographic realism. This includes ensuring that the lighting, shadows, and reflections across the metallic surfaces contribute positively to the natural appearance.",
      "question": "Is the lighting, shadowing, and reflection on the camera and tripod consistent and realistic within the steampunk illustration style, contributing to the image's natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
