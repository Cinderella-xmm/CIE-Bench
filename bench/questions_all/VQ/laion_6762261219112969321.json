      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the leather upholstery with soft, swirling cloud textures across all cushioned areas, this question evaluates whether the texture transformation maintains a natural, volumetric appearance without artificial patterns or flatness. The focus is on the seat, backrest, and armrests where the original quilted leather was present.",
      "question": "Do the cloud textures on the seat, backrest, and armrests appear soft, layered, and continuous without flat or blocky regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the wooden frame and legs into branching wind-like structures, this question assesses whether the material change preserves the original structural outline while introducing organic, flowing forms consistent with wind dynamics. The wooden legs and side frames are key positions for evaluation.",
      "question": "Are the wooden frame and legs replaced with branching, flowing wind-like structures that follow natural fluid motion without sharp angles or rigid breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding whimsical eyes on the cushions, this question checks if the eyes are proportionally placed, well-integrated into the cloud material, and free from harsh outlines or digital artifacts. The eyes should be located on the upper portion of the backrest cushions.",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned on the upper cushions with smooth integration into the cloud texture, lacking jagged edges or unnatural color contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of introducing a flowing mist trail from the back of the sofa, this question evaluates whether the trail extends naturally from the rear, matches the cloud texture in density and flow, and does not abruptly end or appear disconnected.",
      "question": "Does the mist trail extend continuously from the back of the sofa with consistent texture and fading intensity, without sudden breaks or unnatural boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural integrity and visual credibility during transformation, this question checks whether the overall shape of the sofa remains coherent, with no distorted joints, misaligned parts, or floating elements that break physical logic.",
      "question": "Is the overall structure of the sofa preserved with proper alignment between the seat, backrest, arms, and base, without visible gaps, overlaps, or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
