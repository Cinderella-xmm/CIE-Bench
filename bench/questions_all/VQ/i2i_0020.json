      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Considering the sub requirement of converting the scene into a minimalist illustration while retaining the red-and-gray train and STOP sign with simplified color blocks, it is important to check if the geometric simplification maintains structural coherence and avoids unnatural distortion. The train and sign should remain recognizable and visually coherent.",
      "question": "Are the red-and-gray train and STOP sign geometrically simplified without introducing distorted or broken shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Focusing on the sub requirement about reducing the background to green mountain outlines and track lines while maintaining a cool-toned style similar to traffic safety signage, this necessitates checking if these elements appear plausible and authentic against the new minimalistic backdrop.",
      "question": "Do the green mountain outlines and track lines look naturally integrated and consistent with the cool-toned minimalist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Given the sub requirement of avoiding unnatural textures and loss of detail while converting the image to a minimalist illustration, we need to assess whether the simplified elements retain sufficient detail to convey their intended purpose without losing texture clarity.",
      "question": "Have the textures of the simplified train and STOP sign been maintained well enough to avoid loss of essential details and unnatural appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Understanding the sub requirement to simplify the image while keeping it visually credible and coherent demands evaluating whether the minimalist conversion preserves the structural logic and layout of key elements like the train and STOP sign.",
      "question": "Does the minimalist illustration maintain the correct spatial relationship between the train, STOP sign, and tracks without disrupting visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "In line with the sub requirement to ensure a cool-toned color palette reflecting the style of traffic safety signage, itâ€™s crucial to verify if the overall color scheme supports this theme without introducing jarring contrasts or unrealistic hues.",
      "question": "Does the cool-toned color palette remain consistent throughout the minimalist illustration, effectively supporting the traffic safety visual style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
