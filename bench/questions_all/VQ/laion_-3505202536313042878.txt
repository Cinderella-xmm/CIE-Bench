-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the couple into a semi-cartoon style with exaggerated features such as the man’s tuxedo and the woman’s fur jacket. This involves stylization of human figures, which may affect proportionality, facial features, and clothing textures. Attention must be paid to whether the exaggeration preserves anatomical plausibility and avoids unnatural distortions in limbs, facial structure, or fabric folds. The background must be simplified into linear motifs of the event emblem while retaining recognizable elements like the FIA logo and sponsor names (Philips, Volkswagen, Michelin). The addition of a gold ribbon-like border around the scene introduces a new framing element that must align geometrically and stylistically with the rest of the image. Finally, presenting the stamp on a blue envelope with embossed logos requires evaluating texture consistency, depth cues, and alignment between the stamp and envelope.

-Sub requirement 1: The semi-cartoon stylization of the couple must preserve structural coherence—especially in proportions of limbs, head size, and clothing fit—without introducing unnatural elongations, compressed features, or distorted joints.
-Sub requirement 2: Exaggeration of the man's tuxedo and woman’s fur jacket should maintain plausible material representation (e.g., fabric drape, fur texture) despite stylization, avoiding flat or blocky rendering that breaks realism.
-Sub requirement 3: The simplified linear motifs in the background must retain identifiable elements of the original FIA Prize Giving 2013 logo and sponsor branding without losing legibility or becoming abstract to the point of confusion.
-Sub requirement 4: The gold ribbon-like border must form a continuous, symmetrical frame around the central image without gaps, misalignments, or jagged edges that suggest poor rendering.
-Sub requirement 5: The blue envelope with embossed minimalist logos must display consistent surface texture and lighting, ensuring that the embossing appears three-dimensional but not overdone or artificial.
-Sub requirement 6: The integration of the stamp onto the envelope must respect spatial depth and shadowing—ensuring the stamp appears affixed naturally without floating or clipping errors.
-Sub requirement 7: Facial features and hands of both individuals must remain anatomically correct—specifically, the number of fingers should not exceed five, and hand shapes must follow ergonomic norms even under stylization.

Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving structural coherence during semi-cartoon stylization, particularly concerning proportions of limbs and body parts, this question evaluates whether the man’s arms, legs, and torso maintain natural joint angles and relative lengths after exaggeration. It checks for signs of stretching, compression, or unnatural curvature that would break visual credibility.
Question: Do the man's limbs and torso maintain proportional relationships and natural joint articulation despite stylization?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining plausible material representation in the exaggerated clothing, this question assesses whether the man’s tuxedo and woman’s fur jacket retain realistic fabric behavior—such as folds, sheen, and texture—even when stylized. It specifically checks for flatness, lack of depth, or unnatural edge sharpness that could indicate loss of detail.
Question: Are the textures of the tuxedo and fur jacket rendered with sufficient detail and depth to appear physically plausible despite stylization?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of retaining legible elements in the simplified background, this question examines whether the linear motifs of the FIA Prize Giving 2013 logo and sponsor names (Philips, Volkswagen, Michelin) are still recognizable and correctly aligned. It checks for excessive abstraction or distortion that might make logos unidentifiable.
Question: Are the FIA logo and sponsor names clearly visible and correctly formed within the simplified linear background design?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of creating a continuous and symmetrical gold ribbon-like border, this question evaluates whether the border forms a complete, seamless frame around the central image without gaps, overlapping issues, or uneven thickness. It ensures the decorative element is visually coherent and well-integrated.
Question: Is the gold ribbon-like border fully closed, evenly shaped, and consistently thick around the entire perimeter of the stamp?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of realistic embossing on the blue envelope, this question checks whether the minimalist pattern of the event logo appears raised with consistent shading and depth, avoiding flat or overly sharp edges that suggest digital artifacting. It also verifies that the envelope surface has uniform texture and no clipping artifacts.
Question: Does the embossed logo on the blue envelope show consistent depth, soft shadows, and surface texture without appearing flat or artificially rendered?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of natural integration of the stamp onto the envelope, this question evaluates whether the stamp casts a subtle shadow and appears adhered to the surface, rather than floating or clipped. It checks for proper perspective alignment and lighting continuity between the stamp and envelope.
Question: Is the stamp positioned with appropriate shadowing and perspective to appear physically attached to the envelope surface?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q7: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of anatomical correctness in stylized figures, this question specifically targets the hands of both individuals—checking for correct finger count (five per hand), natural hand shape, and absence of distorted or missing digits. It ensures stylization does not compromise basic biological plausibility.
Question: Do both individuals have exactly five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no deformation or missing digits?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
