      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the original rectangular process boxes with cartoon animal characters placed at their respective positions, this evaluation checks whether the character placements respect the original spatial layout of the diagram. Specifically, the owl (Business Understanding), cat (Data Understanding), squirrel (Data Preparation), fox (Modeling), deer (Evaluation), and raccoon (Deployment) must be positioned where their corresponding boxes were, ensuring alignment with the circular flow without displacing adjacent elements.",
      "question": "Are the animal characters positioned directly over the original locations of the process boxes without shifting or overlapping neighboring elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing arrows with playful paths like stepping stones or bridges, this evaluates whether the new connecting elements maintain the directional flow of the original diagram while preserving smooth geometry. The paths must follow the arc of the circle and connect each character in order without sharp angles or discontinuities.",
      "question": "Do the playful paths between characters form a continuous, unbroken winding route that follows the circular structure of the original diagram without abrupt turns or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the central database icon with glowing data crystals, this checks whether the new central element matches the scale and visual weight of the original database icon. It must appear centered and balanced within the circle, with lighting effects that integrate naturally with the surrounding characters and background.",
      "question": "Is the central cluster of glowing data crystals positioned at the center of the diagram and scaled appropriately so it does not dominate or shrink the surrounding characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding speech bubbles with humorous text near each character, this evaluates whether the bubbles are clearly visible, properly spaced, and do not overlap with characters or other elements. The text must be readable and stylistically consistent with the storybook theme.",
      "question": "Are the speech bubbles placed near each character without overlapping them or other elements, and do they contain legible text that is consistent in font and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of assigning specific actions to each character (e.g., squirrel arranging acorns), this checks whether the poses and props are anatomically accurate and physically plausible. For example, the squirrel should have hands capable of arranging acorns, and the fox should hold a paintbrush in a natural grip.",
      "question": "Do the animal characters display realistic limb positions and interactions with props (e.g., magnifying glass, laptop, clipboard) that conform to known anatomy and ergonomics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining a bright, storybook-like aesthetic across all elements, this evaluates whether the color scheme, line thickness, and shading are uniform and cohesive. There should be no areas with inconsistent textures, such as pixelated edges or flat coloring where gradients are expected.",
      "question": "Are all elements (characters, paths, background, text) rendered with consistent line art, shading, and color saturation, avoiding mismatched textures or sudden changes in style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing a title banner at the top of the image, this checks whether the banner is horizontally aligned, proportionally sized, and positioned above the circular diagram without covering any characters or paths.",
      "question": "Is the title banner located at the top edge of the image, fully visible, and not overlapping any part of the diagram or characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
