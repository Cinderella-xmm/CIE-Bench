Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility while transforming the person and giraffe into LEGO minifigures, we need to assess if the transformation retains the natural appearance and avoids introducing unnatural textures or distortions.
Question: Are the LEGO minifigures of the person and giraffe free from unnatural textures and maintain their structural coherence?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement emphasizes avoiding distortion such as damaged geometric shapes during the transformation. We need to ensure that the geometric shapes of the LEGO minifigures remain intact and visually credible.
Question: Do the geometric shapes of the LEGO minifigures appear undamaged and structurally consistent?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement focuses on ensuring the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the scene. We need to evaluate if the transparent glass cube enclosing the composition looks natural and does not introduce any obvious artifacts.
Question: Does the transparent glass cube enclosing the LEGO scene look natural and free from obvious artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement highlights the importance of maintaining a balance between the collectible's intricate design and lighting. We need to confirm if the lighting in the scene properly emphasizes the details of the LEGO minifigures and the glass cube.
Question: Does the lighting in the scene properly highlight the intricate details of the LEGO minifigures and the glass cube without causing any distortions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement stresses the avoidance of introducing unnatural textures and loss of details. We need to verify if the gradient background complements the scene's earthy and natural tones without affecting the overall visual quality.
Question: Does the gradient background complement the scene's earthy and natural tones without introducing unnatural textures or loss of details?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
