      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering the owl and tree in a lush, detailed botanical illustration style using earthy tones, this question evaluates whether the textures of the owl’s feathers and tree bark remain natural and consistent with real-world biological materials after style conversion. It checks for artificial smoothing, over-sharpening, or unnatural patterns that would compromise authenticity.",
      "question": "Are the textures of the owl’s feathers and the tree bark rendered with realistic detail and variation, without unnatural repetition or synthetic-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the full moon into a dotted diagram with lunar cycle labels, this question assesses whether the transformation maintains geometric integrity and visual coherence. It checks for distortions such as uneven dots, misaligned labels, or loss of clarity due to low resolution or poor anti-aliasing.",
      "question": "Is the moon depicted as a circular dotted diagram with evenly spaced dots and clear, legible labels indicating lunar phases, without jagged edges or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of annotating the owl’s sharp talons and feathers with educational labels, this question evaluates whether the labels are properly integrated into the image without obscuring anatomical details or introducing visual clutter. It checks for proper placement, font consistency, and readability.",
      "question": "Are the labels pointing to the owl’s talons and feathers placed without overlapping vital features, and do they use consistent line styles and text formatting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a text box at the bottom with a description of nocturnal adaptations, this question checks whether the text box is proportionally sized, stylistically appropriate, and positioned so it does not interfere with the main subject or balance of the composition. It ensures the addition does not create visual imbalance or occlusion.",
      "question": "Is the text box located at the bottom of the image, sized appropriately, and styled with earthy tones and readable typography that matches the botanical illustration theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence and visual credibility across all elements, this question evaluates whether the overall composition remains physically plausible—specifically, whether the owl is correctly perched on the branch, the tree trunk has consistent curvature and thickness, and the moon appears at a reasonable scale and position relative to the tree canopy.",
      "question": "Does the owl sit naturally on the tree branch with correct posture and claw positioning, and is the tree trunk and branch structure continuous and anatomically plausible without breaks or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
