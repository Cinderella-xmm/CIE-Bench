      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of evaluating the chibi transformationâ€™s structural coherence, specifically focusing on facial proportions and head-to-body ratio, this question checks whether the face and body maintain geometric consistency after stylization. The original image has a balanced adult female figure; the chibi version should scale down features proportionally without breaking symmetry or causing unnatural elongation or compression.",
      "question": "Is the head-to-body ratio of the figure exaggerated but still structurally coherent, with no visible warping or misalignment of facial features?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement assessing the porcelain finish of the dress, this question evaluates whether the material change introduces unnatural reflections, texture irregularities, or color inconsistencies. The original fabric has a matte, textile appearance; the edited version must show a smooth, uniform surface with subtle highlights typical of porcelain.",
      "question": "Does the dress exhibit a smooth, consistent porcelain-like surface with no rough patches, texture artifacts, or unnatural glare?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement regarding the replacement of the ferret with a lamb, this question checks whether the new animal is realistically integrated into the scene. The lamb must appear fluffy, appropriately sized, and supported by the hands without floating or overlapping unnaturally.",
      "question": "Is the lamb positioned in the lap with sufficient volume and soft texture, and does it rest naturally within the hands without clipping or floating?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement about the added base mimicking a Renaissance painting backdrop, this question assesses whether the base integrates visually with the background and maintains proper perspective. The base should appear grounded and not disrupt the depth relationship between the figure and the landscape.",
      "question": "Is the base beneath the figure aligned with the foreground plane and does it blend seamlessly with the background without casting incorrect shadows or creating floating effects?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement concerning facial feature proportionality, this question focuses on the eyes, which are typically enlarged in chibi style. The enlargement must not cause asymmetry, misplacement, or unnatural spacing while retaining clear definition.",
      "question": "Are the eyes proportionally enlarged but symmetrically placed, with no distortion in shape or spacing relative to the nose and mouth?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement about hand anatomy, this question verifies that the hands retain five fingers each, proper joint angles, and natural curvature. Even in stylized form, the number and shape of fingers must conform to human anatomy to avoid surrealism.",
      "question": "Do both hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural joint alignment and no extra or missing digits?",
