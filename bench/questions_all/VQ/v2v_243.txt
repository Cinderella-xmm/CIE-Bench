Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the overall realism and natural appearance while transforming the skis and hockey sticks into wearable footwear, we need to assess if the transformation retains the structural coherence and visual plausibility of the original objects.
Question: Do the transformed skis and hockey sticks maintain their original structural integrity and proportions as footwear, avoiding any unnatural distortions or breaks in geometry?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of ensuring the maintained style and materials reflect the overall sense of reality and natural appearance, we need to evaluate if the vivid patterns and wooden textures are seamlessly integrated into the new footwear design.
Question: Are the vivid patterns and wooden textures from the original skis and hockey sticks naturally incorporated into the footwear design without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of detail?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: To ensure the retained core element ensures structural consistency and visual credibility, we need to check if the transition from sports equipment to wearable items appears logical and plausible.
Question: Does the transition from skis and hockey sticks to footwear appear logical and plausible, maintaining the visual credibility of both the original and new forms?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the sub requirement of avoiding the introduction of artifacts such as unnatural textures and loss of details, we need to verify if the fine details of the original objects are preserved in the new design.
Question: Have the fine details of the original skis and hockey sticks been preserved in the new footwear design, avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: To ensure the proportion and physical rationality of each element avoid distortion such as damaged geometric shapes, we need to confirm if the new footwear design respects the physical properties and proportions of the original objects.
Question: Does the new footwear design respect the physical properties and proportions of the original skis and hockey sticks, avoiding any distortion or damage to geometric shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
