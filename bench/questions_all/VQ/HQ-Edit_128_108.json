      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the ornate lantern into a luxurious candle brand packaging while retaining its intricate pattern design, evaluate whether the structural integrity and geometric shape of the lantern remain consistent after conversion. The original lantern is a complex, symmetrical, multi-tiered object with precise lattice patterns and domed sections; any deformation or misalignment in these elements during transformation would compromise visual credibility and natural appearance.",
      "question": "Does the transformed lantern maintain its original symmetrical shape and geometric proportions without visible distortion or broken lattice patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a metallic embossed logo of a flame to the lanternâ€™s exterior, assess whether the added logo integrates seamlessly with the surface texture and material properties of the lantern. The original lantern has a dark metal base with colored glass inlays; an improperly rendered logo could introduce unnatural highlights, incorrect depth, or inconsistent material textures.",
      "question": "Is the metallic embossed flame logo on the lantern's surface consistent with the surrounding material, showing realistic depth and reflections without unnatural edges or color mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adapting marketplace elements below into elegant texture patterns on the box sides, evaluate whether the transition from real-world market scenes (such as spice bowls, people, and stalls) to stylized decorative textures maintains visual coherence. The original image features detailed spices and fabric textures; if these are abstracted poorly, they may appear pixelated, stretched, or implausible.",
      "question": "Are the marketplace elements converted into side textures of the packaging clearly recognizable as derived from the original scene but stylized appropriately, without distortion or loss of fine detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enhancing the color scheme with deep golds and ambers for a rich finish, assess whether the new colors harmonize with the original lighting and materials. The original image uses warm ambient light and earthy tones; introducing overly saturated or mismatched gold/amber hues could disrupt the natural lighting balance and create artificial-looking gradients.",
      "question": "Do the deep gold and amber tones applied to the packaging blend naturally with the existing lighting and material colors, avoiding harsh transitions or unnatural glow effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of including a scented candle silhouette on the front of the packaging, evaluate whether the silhouette is proportionally accurate and visually plausible within the context of the packaging design. The silhouette must not appear warped, misaligned, or floating unnaturally against the background.",
      "question": "Is the scented candle silhouette positioned correctly on the packaging front, maintaining proper scale and alignment with the surrounding design elements without visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
