      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"exaggerating knitted textures of the woolen cardigan,\" this involves enhancing the textile details. The original image shows a brown cable-knit cardigan with visible texture, but the editing instruction specifies an exaggerated version. This requires evaluating whether the enhanced texture remains physically plausible and avoids unnatural patterns or distortions in the knit structure.",
      "question": "Are the knitted textures on the cardigan visibly exaggerated but still consistent with real knitting patterns, without broken stitches or irregular loops?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"rendering buttons as focal points in metallic hues,\" the original image features dark, non-metallic buttons. The edit introduces metallic material properties. This requires checking if the metallic finish appears natural under lighting conditions, maintains proper reflections, and does not introduce artificial glares or inconsistent shading.",
      "question": "Do the buttons exhibit metallic sheen with realistic highlights and shadows that match the surrounding fabric and ambient light?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"matching soft, warm tones to the vintage floral wallpaper,\" the original image has a cool-toned blue-green background with floral patterns. The edit aims to harmonize the cardigan’s color with the wall. This requires assessing whether the adjusted tone of the cardigan blends naturally with the wallpaper's palette without clashing or appearing artificially tinted.",
      "question": "Does the color of the cardigan maintain a warm tone that complements the vintage floral wallpaper without introducing unnatural color shifts or contrast mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"adding detailed embroidery to the frame for an elegant finish,\" the original image includes two framed artworks behind the subject. The editing instruction implies modifying these frames by adding embroidery. This requires evaluating whether the added embroidery is seamlessly integrated into the frame’s design, preserving its physical form and avoiding distortion or floating elements.",
      "question": "Is the embroidery on the frame clearly defined, properly aligned with the frame edges, and free from floating or misaligned threads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"creating a limited-edition art print on textured canvas,\" the entire image must reflect a canvas-like surface with subtle texture. The original image appears smooth. This requires checking whether the canvas texture is uniformly applied across the image without disrupting facial features, clothing details, or background elements.",
      "question": "Is the canvas texture evenly distributed across the entire image, preserving fine details such as hair, facial lines, and fabric weave without blurring or obscuring them?",
