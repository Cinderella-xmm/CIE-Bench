      "thinking_process": "Based on Sub requirement 1, the skyscrapers' facades are to be replaced with pixel-patterned luminous surfaces. The central tall building and surrounding towers must retain their original rectangular shapes and vertical alignment. Any distortion in these shapes—such as skewed corners, stretched proportions, or missing sections—would compromise structural coherence. The question evaluates whether the digital pattern adheres to the correct geometry of each building.",
      "question": "Do the pixel-patterned facades on the skyscrapers align precisely with the original building outlines, showing no distorted edges or misaligned blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on Sub requirement 4, trees in the park and along the riverbank are to be converted into glowing angular circuits. Each tree must maintain a recognizable root-to-canopy structure, even if stylized. If branches appear broken, floating, or unnaturally bent, it would violate geometric plausibility. The question checks whether the digital transformation respects the underlying tree form.",
      "question": "Are the angular digital circuits forming the trees connected logically from base to tip, with no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on Sub requirement 7, the bridge's rails and sides are to be lit with neon. The lighting must follow the actual curvature and length of the bridge. If the neon lines deviate from the track path or appear fragmented, it suggests a failure in structural integration. The question assesses whether the lighting conforms to the bridge’s physical layout.",
      "question": "Do the neon lights along the bridge run continuously along the rail tracks and side panels without gaps or incorrect bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "Based on Sub requirement 10, the entire scene must undergo uniform editing. If some buildings remain unaltered while others are fully digitalized, or if only certain trees are changed, the result will lack visual cohesion. The question evaluates whether the transformation is applied consistently across all designated areas.",
      "question": "Are all skyscrapers in the skyline uniformly converted to pixel-patterned luminous towers, with no partial or missing conversions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on Sub requirement 11, fine details such as window grids, tree bark, and bridge supports must not be lost during editing. If the digital overlay obscures or blurs these features, it reduces perceptual quality. The question checks whether essential textures and structural elements remain visible and intact.",
      "question": "Are the window grids on the buildings, the individual beams of the bridge, and the foliage of non-digital trees still clearly visible and undistorted after editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
