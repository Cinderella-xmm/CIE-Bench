Q1:
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the phone and stand with a seaside café tabletop setting while ensuring overall realism and natural appearance, we need to assess the integration of the new oceanic environment into the existing scene.
Question: Does the seaside café tabletop setting blend naturally with the table surface, avoiding any noticeable break in texture or lighting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the need to maintain structural coherence and visual plausibility for the new setting, we must check if the replacement introduces any distorted shapes or disrupts the overall scene harmony.
Question: Are the shapes and proportions of sea waves and sunlight reflections accurately depicted, maintaining structural consistency without unnatural breaks or distortions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: To preserve the authenticity and natural appearance after the transformation, it’s crucial the materials and textures of the new elements match the scene convincingly.
Question: Do the materials of the seaside elements, such as the table, sea waves, and sunlight reflections, appear authentic, free from unnatural textures and visual artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The new setting should be logically coherent within the context of the edited image. The alignment between the sunlight and its reflections should adhere to natural laws.
Question: Are the sunlight reflections on the sea waves consistent with the sun's expected position, maintaining physical logic and visual credibility?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Ensuring the composition and layout of the new elements contribute positively to the edited image's visual integrity requires careful attention to detail, proportion, and placement.
Question: Does the overall composition of the seaside café setting fit naturally on the tabletop, enhancing the image's visual coherence without introducing distracting or misplaced elements?
Choices: Yes, No
