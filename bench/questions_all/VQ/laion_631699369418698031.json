      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a cylindrical glass dome around the totem pole, this question evaluates whether the dome appears structurally coherent and visually plausible. The dome must enclose the entire totem without clipping or overlapping incorrectly, and its transparency should allow clear visibility of the totem while showing realistic light interaction (e.g., subtle reflections or refractions). The presence of any jagged edges, ghosting, or unnatural transparency would indicate artifacts.",
      "question": "Is the cylindrical glass dome fully enclosing the totem pole without visible clipping, jagged edges, or unnatural transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding ferns and moss at the base of the totem, this question checks the physical plausibility and integration of these elements. They must be placed directly on the base, not floating above it, and their size and texture should match typical miniature plant dimensions. Shadows and lighting should suggest they are grounded within the scene.",
      "question": "Are the ferns and moss at the base of the totem grounded and proportionally sized, with no floating or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing a butterfly on top of the totem, this question evaluates whether the butterfly is correctly scaled and anatomically consistent. It should rest naturally on the uppermost part of the totem, such as the crown or horns, without deforming the structure beneath. Its wings should show natural patterns and not appear pixelated or stretched.",
      "question": "Is the butterfly perched on the top of the totem with correct scale, natural wing shape, and no deformation of the totem’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining an earthy color palette with green accents, this question assesses whether the added elements (plants, butterfly) use naturalistic colors that complement the wood tones. There should be no abrupt color mismatches, unnatural saturation, or color bleeding between materials.",
      "question": "Do the ferns, moss, and butterfly use natural green tones that harmonize with the wood color of the totem without unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving the original totem’s structure and fine details, this question checks whether the carving details—such as facial features, grooves, and textures—are intact and unaltered by the editing process. No parts of the totem should appear blurred, stretched, or missing due to the addition of new elements.",
      "question": "Are all carved facial features and wood grain details on the totem clearly visible and undistorted after editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
