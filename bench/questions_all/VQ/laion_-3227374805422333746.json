      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing stone textures with wooden planks on the exterior walls, evaluate whether the material change maintains visual credibility and avoids unnatural transitions. The original image shows stone pillars and wall sections; replacing these with wood must preserve geometric continuity and avoid abrupt seams or mismatched grain patterns.",
      "question": "Are the wooden planks on the walls seamlessly integrated with no visible gaps, misalignment, or unnatural texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding moss texture to the base of the building, assess whether the moss appears naturally distributed and anchored to the structure. The base includes stone blocks and steps where moss would typically grow in crevices and along edges.",
      "question": "Does the moss texture cover only appropriate surfaces (e.g., lower stone blocks, corners) and appear layered and organic without floating or flat patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting colors to earthy tones, determine if the overall color palette remains cohesive and free from unnatural shifts. The original has bright red tiles and warm wood tones; shifting to earthy tones should avoid overly desaturated or muddy hues that break visual harmony.",
      "question": "Are the roof tiles, walls, and wooden elements uniformly adjusted to earthy tones without inconsistent color gradients or localized discoloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating miniature fantasy characters beside the building, evaluate whether their placement respects scale, posture, and environmental interaction. Characters should be proportionally smaller than the house and positioned near entrances or pathways.",
      "question": "Are the miniature characters correctly scaled relative to the house and positioned in plausible locations (e.g., near doors, paths) without floating or intersecting with structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a parchment-style board with “Castle Quest” text beneath the house, assess whether the board is proportionally sized, properly shaded, and integrated into the scene. It should rest on the ground plane and cast a shadow consistent with the lighting.",
      "question": "Is the parchment board positioned flat on the ground with realistic folds, texture, and shadow alignment matching the light source direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of positioning detailed rule booklets beside the set, verify that they are realistically rendered with visible pages, correct thickness, and proper shadowing. They should not overlap other objects or appear detached from the surface.",
      "question": "Do the rule booklets have consistent page thickness, visible spine details, and shadows that align with the lighting and surface they rest on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
