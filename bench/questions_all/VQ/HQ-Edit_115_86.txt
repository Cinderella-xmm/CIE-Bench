Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction involves transforming the original realistic ballerina image into a cartoon-style postcard with exaggerated tutu designs, soft pastel backgrounds, glitter accents on the costume, blank message spaces, and floral border motifs. This requires significant style transformation and addition of new elements. The original image features a young ballerina in a pink tutu, performing on a wooden stage under spotlight lighting. Key areas to edit include the ballerina’s costume (tutu), background, lighting, and overall artistic style. The changes must preserve structural coherence while introducing stylized elements without distorting anatomy or material textures. The focus is on maintaining visual plausibility despite stylistic exaggeration.

-Sub requirement 1: Transforming the ballerina's costume into an exaggerated cartoon-style tutu—does this modification maintain structural consistency and avoid unnatural geometric distortions such as warped layers or misaligned fabric folds?

-Sub requirement 2: Adding glitter accents to the costume—do these elements appear integrated into the fabric texture without introducing pixelated, overly sharp, or unnatural sparkle patterns that break material realism?

-Sub requirement 3: Changing the background to soft pastel shades—does this alter the scene’s depth and lighting in a way that preserves spatial coherence and avoids abrupt transitions or loss of shadow detail?

-Sub requirement 4: Introducing blank message spaces—do these areas appear cleanly inserted without disrupting the underlying surface texture (e.g., floorboards or costume) or causing visible seams or artifacts?

-Sub requirement 5: Adding floral motifs on borders—do these decorative elements align properly with the frame edges, maintain consistent scale and perspective, and avoid overlapping or clipping with the subject?

-Sub requirement 6: Converting the overall image to a cartoon style—does the transformation preserve anatomical accuracy (especially in limbs, hands, and feet) and avoid deformation such as elongated joints, incorrect finger count, or distorted proportions?

-Sub requirement 7: Maintaining the ballerina’s pose and balance—does the edited version retain physical rationality (e.g., weight distribution, foot positioning on pointe) even under stylization?

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of modifying the tutu into an exaggerated cartoon design, evaluate whether the shape and layering of the tutu remain structurally coherent and free from geometric distortions such as uneven ruffles, collapsed volume, or unnatural expansion that breaks the silhouette logic.
Question: Does the tutu maintain a balanced, layered structure with no visible warping or collapsed sections that suggest digital distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding glitter accents to the costume, assess whether the glitter appears embedded within the fabric texture rather than floating or appearing as isolated, sharp pixels that disrupt material continuity.
Question: Are the glitter elements seamlessly blended into the tutu and bodice, showing natural variation in size and brightness without pixelation or unnatural clumping?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of changing the background to soft pastel shades, evaluate whether the transition from dark to light maintains smooth gradients and does not introduce banding, harsh edges, or loss of ambient shadow detail around the subject.
Question: Is the background gradient smooth and continuous, with no visible banding or abrupt color shifts that separate it from the subject’s silhouette?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of inserting blank message spaces, check if these areas are cleanly placed without affecting the underlying textures (such as wood grain or costume fabric) or creating visible seams, ghosting, or transparency errors.
Question: Are the blank message areas fully opaque and aligned with the image plane, with no visible edge artifacts or texture disruption beneath them?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding floral motifs on the borders, verify whether the flowers are proportionally sized, correctly oriented, and do not overlap or clip into the main subject or background elements.
Question: Do the floral motifs along the borders stay within the frame boundaries and maintain consistent scale and orientation without intersecting the ballerina or floor?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the image to a cartoon style while preserving anatomy, evaluate whether the ballerina’s hands have five fingers each, with natural joint alignment and no elongation, fusion, or missing digits.
Question: Do both hands show exactly five fingers each, with natural curvature and spacing, and no extra or fused digits?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q7: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining physical rationality in the pose, assess whether the ballerina’s feet remain properly aligned on pointe, with correct arch and toe position, and whether the leg alignment supports the balance of the pose.
Question: Are both feet positioned correctly on pointe with natural arches and toes, and is the supporting leg aligned to sustain the posture without unnatural bending?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
