      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the floral headdress into a chibi-style headpiece while preserving vivid orange and yellow hues, this question evaluates whether the flower colors remain consistent and smooth without unnatural banding or color clipping, particularly around petal edges and transitions between petals.",
      "question": "Are the orange and yellow flower petals in the headpiece free from color banding, pixelation, or sharp, unnatural edges?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating the braided hair design into the headpiece, this question checks the continuity and geometric accuracy of the black, orange, and yellow braids, ensuring they follow natural hair physics and do not exhibit broken strands, irregular spacing, or abrupt shape changes.",
      "question": "Do the black, orange, and yellow braids in the headpiece maintain consistent thickness, smooth curvature, and uninterrupted strand alignment?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the gold earrings into miniature chibi-style charms attached to the headpiece, this question assesses whether the earrings have been resized proportionally and retain their detailed lattice patterns without blurring or loss of fine geometry.",
      "question": "Are the gold earrings reduced in size and repositioned on the headpiece while preserving their intricate mesh patterns and metallic sheen?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring structural coherence between the headpiece and facial features, this question evaluates whether the headpiece elements (flowers, braids, earrings) are properly anchored to the head and do not float or detach from the hairline or ear area.",
      "question": "Are the flowers, braids, and earrings positioned so that they appear physically connected to the head and hair without gaps or floating elements?",

      "question": "Are there any visible seams, unnatural shadows, or texture discontinuities at the edges of the headpiece where it meets the face or hair?",
