      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the image to a watercolor illustration style while preserving the bedding pattern, we need to ensure the style conversion doesn't introduce unnatural textures or lose details within the quilt's design. We assess the texture and detail preservation of the quilt patterns.",
      "question": "Do the quilts' patterns maintain their structural consistency and detailed appearance without unnatural texture disruption after conversion to a watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Considering the instruction of converting the whole image into a watercolor style while retaining the bedding pattern, the colors should appear soft yet true-to-life. We analyze if the color transition remains natural and the lighting feels authentic post-edit.",
      "question": "Have the colors of the bedding and surrounding elements been naturally blended into the watercolor style without appearing unnaturally muted or overly vivid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction demands a watercolor texture across the image while maintaining visual plausibility. We check if the furniture and decorative items retain their shape and material realism without appearing distorted or losing details during the style transformation.",
      "question": "Do the nightstand, picture frames, and flowers retain their natural shapes and material textures without distortion or unnatural artifacts in the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The watercolor conversion should preserve the spatial arrangement and layout of the room's elements. We inspect if the spatial relationships between objects like beds, the nightstand, and wall decorations remain visually credible and coherent after editing.",
      "question": "Are the relative positions and proportions of the beds, nightstand, and wall pictures consistent and visually plausible in the watercolor illustration style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "As per the instruction, the watercolor effect should not degrade the fine details of the bedding pattern or introduce artifacts. We examine if the quilt's complex patchwork design remains discernible and undistorted in the painted effect.",
      "question": "Does the quilt's intricate patchwork design stay recognizable and free from distortion or unnatural simplification in the watercolor illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
