Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the spiral staircase into an ethereal guardian serpent with lattice-like scales, evaluate whether the new texture applied to the body (formerly the stairs) maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows a well-defined spiral staircase with consistent step geometry; replacing it with a serpent’s body requires that the scale pattern follows the curvature naturally without breaking geometric continuity or introducing unnatural textures.
Question: Does the lattice-like scale pattern along the serpent's body follow the spiral curve smoothly without abrupt breaks or misaligned edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of extending the serpent’s body downward to imitate the steps, assess whether the transition from stair-like form to serpentine shape preserves proportion and physical rationality. The original steps have uniform depth and spacing; the edited version must maintain this spatial logic in the transformation.
Question: Are the individual segments of the serpent's body aligned with the original stair treads such that each segment corresponds to a step in size and spacing?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the banister with delicate, translucent fins, evaluate whether the replacement maintains material consistency and visual credibility. The original railing has ornate filigree metalwork; the fins must appear as if they are part of the same architectural style but with a different material property (translucency), without appearing disconnected or unnaturally placed.
Question: Do the translucent fins extend from the original railing position in a continuous, flowing manner without gaps or distortions in their shape or placement?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of embedding marble-like texture onto the serpent’s body to mimic the stair materials, assess whether the texture is consistent with the original stone-like appearance of the staircase. The original stairs show fine grain and shading typical of polished stone; the edited texture must match this quality without introducing artificial patterns or inconsistent lighting effects.
Question: Is the marble-like texture on the serpent’s body evenly distributed and consistent with the lighting and shading of the original staircase surface?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of embedding the serpent’s head at the top with luminescent gem eyes, evaluate whether the head placement respects the circular opening at the top of the staircase and whether the gem eyes appear integrated rather than pasted on. The original image has a clear circular skylight or opening; the head must fit within this space without distorting the surrounding architecture.
Question: Is the serpent’s head positioned within the circular opening at the top of the staircase without overlapping or deforming the surrounding wall or ceiling structure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
