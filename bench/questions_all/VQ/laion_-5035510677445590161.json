      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the red velvet suit with an 18th-century explorer coat featuring leather details, this question evaluates whether the new coat’s material appears natural and consistent with historical garments. The focus is on the texture, color variation, and seam integration of the coat, particularly around the shoulders, sleeves, and front closure, to ensure no artificial patches or unnatural patterns are introduced.",
      "question": "Does the explorer coat have a consistent fabric texture with visible stitching and leather accents that appear physically plausible and free of obvious digital artifacts?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the red Santa hat with a tricorn hat, this question checks whether the new hat conforms to typical tricorn geometry—three points, correct size relative to the head, and proper material appearance such as felt or wool. It also evaluates whether the hat casts a shadow consistent with the light source and does not float unnaturally above the head.",
      "question": "Is the tricorn hat properly shaped with three distinct points, correctly sized for the head, and casting a natural shadow consistent with the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the white gloves with leather gauntlets, this question focuses on the anatomical accuracy of the hand and the realism of the leather material. The hand must show five fingers with natural curvature, and the gauntlet must extend smoothly from the sleeve without gaps or unnatural folding.",
      "question": "Does the leather gauntlet on the extended hand show five fingers with natural joint bends, and does it connect seamlessly to the sleeve without visible seams or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the background with a snowy mountain landscape, this question assesses the integration of the new environment with the foreground figure. It checks for continuity in lighting, depth, and horizon line alignment, ensuring there are no sharp edges or mismatched tones between the subject and the background.",
      "question": "Is the snowy mountain background seamlessly blended with the figure, showing consistent lighting, depth cues, and no visible cutout lines or color mismatches along the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving facial features and lighting consistency, this question examines whether the beard, glasses, and facial expression remain unchanged and naturally lit under the new environmental conditions. It checks for any blurring, stretching, or incorrect shadow placement that would suggest poor compositing.",
      "question": "Are the facial features, including the beard, glasses, and skin tone, preserved without distortion, and do they receive lighting consistent with the direction and quality of light in the snowy mountain scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
