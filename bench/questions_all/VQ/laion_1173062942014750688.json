      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the beads into a mystical serpent creature with a segmented, multicolored body using the red and yellow patterns for scales, evaluate whether the scale-like texture formed from the original bead patterns maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The editing involves reinterpreting spherical beads as segments of a snake’s body, so it is essential to check if the transition from discrete beads to continuous segments preserves natural geometry and avoids unnatural distortions such as flattened or stretched shapes.",
      "question": "Are the individual bead segments aligned in a smooth, continuous curve that mimics the natural curvature of a serpent's body without abrupt angular breaks or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using blue circles from the original beads as iridescent eyes, evaluate whether the placement and appearance of the eyes are anatomically plausible and visually consistent with the rest of the serpent’s form. The original blue dots are small and scattered; their transformation into eyes must maintain size proportionality and avoid floating or misplaced features.",
      "question": "Are the blue circular elements positioned at the head end of the serpent in a symmetrical, forward-facing arrangement typical of animal eyes, and do they appear integrated into the surface rather than floating or disconnected?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating black motifs as intricate tribal markings, assess whether these markings are applied in a way that follows natural surface contours and does not introduce artificial or repetitive patterns that break visual continuity. The original black patterns are irregular and abstract, so their use as tribal art should preserve this organic quality without over-regularization.",
      "question": "Do the black tribal markings follow the natural flow of the serpent’s body segments and avoid sharp, unnatural edges or uniform repetition that suggests digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of designing the tail as a long, wispy charm with dangling, smaller bead-like tips to evoke motion, evaluate whether the tail extension maintains physical plausibility and material consistency. The tail should appear lighter and more dynamic than the main body, with smaller elements that suggest movement but not detachment or floating.",
      "question": "Does the tail extend naturally from the rear of the serpent, tapering smoothly and ending in small, loosely connected bead-like tips that appear to hang or sway without breaking the continuity of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the original materials and colors while transforming the beads into a serpent, evaluate whether the overall texture and material appearance remain consistent with the original glazed ceramic-like finish. The transformation should not introduce unnatural sheen, transparency, or texture mismatch that would break the illusion of continuity.",
      "question": "Is the surface texture of the serpent’s body uniformly matte or slightly glossy like the original beads, without introducing areas of unnatural shine, roughness, or inconsistent material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
