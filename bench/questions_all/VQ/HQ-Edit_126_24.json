      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing large ferns with bioluminescent mushrooms with translucent veils, this question evaluates whether the newly introduced mushroom shapes maintain natural proportions and texture coherence with the surrounding mossy ground and rock formations. Specifically, it checks for smooth transitions between mushroom caps and stems, absence of jagged edges, and realistic translucency in the veils.",
      "question": "Do the bioluminescent mushrooms in the mid-ground and foreground have smooth, continuous surfaces without pixelation or unnatural edge artifacts?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming tree trunks into sentient beings with twisted faces and vine-like hair, this question focuses on the facial features of the modified trees, particularly their geometric structure and integration with bark texture. It checks whether the face is symmetrical, proportionally balanced, and seamlessly embedded into the trunk without breaking the continuity of bark patterns or introducing sharp, artificial lines.",
      "question": "Are the facial features on the transformed tree trunks (left and right sides) geometrically coherent and smoothly integrated into the bark texture without visible seams or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting birds into fairy creatures with iridescent wings, this question examines the physical plausibility of the new wing structure. It checks whether the wings display smooth gradients of color, consistent thickness, and natural curvature, avoiding blocky or aliased edges that suggest low-resolution rendering or texture mapping errors.",
      "question": "Do the iridescent wings of the fairy creatures near the stream and on rocks show smooth color transitions and uniform transparency without pixelation or unnatural banding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the stream with silver mist and glowing will-o'-wisps, this question evaluates the visual credibility of the mist's flow and interaction with the environment. It checks whether the mist follows the contours of rocks and maintains a consistent density, and whether the will-o'-wisps emit soft glows without creating halo effects or clipping against solid objects.",
      "question": "Does the silver mist flow naturally over the mossy rocks and around the streambed, maintaining consistent opacity and avoiding abrupt changes in density or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring all edited elements integrate with ambient lighting and depth cues, this question assesses whether the bioluminescent mushrooms and will-o'-wisps cast appropriate soft glows that interact realistically with nearby surfaces. It checks for proper shadowing, light falloff, and alignment with the overall directional lighting from above.",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements (mushrooms and will-o'-wisps) emit soft light that casts subtle shadows and blends with ambient illumination without creating harsh highlights or disconnected glow zones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
