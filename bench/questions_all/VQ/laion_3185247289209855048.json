      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the natural hair with a glossy gold wavy hair enamel pin featuring pearl embellishments, this question evaluates whether the shape, texture, and lighting of the new pin maintain visual coherence with the surrounding facial features and skin tone. Specifically, it checks if the pin appears integrated and free from abrupt edges or unnatural highlights that would suggest poor rendering.",
      "question": "Does the gold wavy hair enamel pin on the head have smooth, continuous curves without jagged edges or distorted proportions?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the pink fur garment with an enamel pin showing a soft pink silky fur texture, this question examines whether the material representation matches the expected properties of a polished enamel surface—such as uniform sheen and reflective qualities—rather than mimicking actual fur texture, which would be inconsistent with the pin’s nature.",
      "question": "Is the pink fur-textured enamel pin on the shoulder rendered with a consistent glossy finish and no visible fibrous or organic texture that contradicts its intended material?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a minimalist outline enamel pin, this question assesses whether the geometric structure of the pin is intact, with clean lines and proper closure, ensuring it does not appear fragmented or misshapen due to digital manipulation.",
      "question": "Are the lines of the minimalist outline enamel pin complete, evenly spaced, and free from broken segments or irregular curvature?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that all pins should have a vibrant, polished finish, this question checks for uniformity in surface reflectivity and color saturation across all three pins, ensuring there are no areas of pixelation, banding, or unnatural glow that indicate poor rendering.",
      "question": "Do all three enamel pins exhibit consistent glossiness and color intensity without visible noise, halos, or uneven shading?",

      "question": "Are the three enamel pins positioned such that they appear to rest on the subject’s head and shoulder without intersecting through skin or appearing detached from the surface?",
