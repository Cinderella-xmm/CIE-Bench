      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the stone walls with spiced biscuit panels, this question evaluates whether the material transformation results in a natural appearance across the building's surface. The focus is on texture consistency, absence of artificial seams, and preservation of architectural lines.",
      "question": "Do the biscuit panels on the building walls exhibit uniform texture and color without visible cracks, patches, or unnatural grain patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the metallic dome with a sugar-glazed cinnamon dome, this question assesses whether the new dome maintains smooth curvature and proper scale relative to the building. It checks for artifacts such as uneven glaze, sharp edges, or incorrect proportions.",
      "question": "Is the sugar-glazed dome smoothly curved with consistent color and reflective properties, and does it align correctly with the base structure without appearing warped or misproportioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of decorating windows and doors with icing patterns, this question evaluates whether the added decorations are precisely aligned with the architectural openings and do not distort their shapes. It focuses on detail clarity and material realism.",
      "question": "Are the icing patterns on the windows and doors clearly defined, evenly applied, and positioned within the frame boundaries without overlapping or deforming the original window/door shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the surrounding trees into candy sculptures, this question checks whether the tree forms retain structural coherence after material conversion. It examines leaf texture, branch continuity, and overall silhouette plausibility.",
      "question": "Do the tree trunks and branches maintain natural branching patterns, and are the sugar-coated leaves evenly distributed without clumping or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the scene on a smooth marble slab, this question evaluates whether the ground plane has been uniformly extended beneath the building and trees without visible seams, perspective errors, or scale mismatches.",
      "question": "Does the marble slab extend continuously under the building and surrounding area, with consistent lighting and reflection, and no visible gaps or distortions at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
