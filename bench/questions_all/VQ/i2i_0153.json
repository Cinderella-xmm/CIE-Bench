      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the truck structure while adding a realistic cartoon rendering style, we need to assess if the truck retains its structural consistency and visual credibility despite the style change. By observing the truck's shape and proportions, we can determine if the style conversion introduces any unnatural distortions.",
      "question": "Does the truck maintain its original proportions and structural integrity without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The sub requirement emphasizes avoiding the introduction of unnatural textures and loss of details during the style conversion. We need to examine the surfaces and textures of the truck to ensure they retain their natural appearance and detail level in the realistic cartoon style.",
      "question": "Are the surfaces and textures of the truck, such as the wheels, cab, and grille, free from unnatural artifacts and retain appropriate levels of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Considering the requirement to keep the truck structure but in a bolder line and more vivid color style, we must verify if the color modifications do not disrupt the natural appearance and material properties of the truck. We should specifically look at the cab area which is prominently affected by the color changes.",
      "question": "Do the cab's vibrant colors appear natural against the truck's materials and lighting conditions, ensuring material consistency and avoiding unrealistic contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The editing instructions call for a simplified background in the realistic cartoon style. To ensure the background remains visually plausible and does not detract from the truck's prominence, we should check the background's interaction with the truck and its contribution to the scene's authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the simplified background naturally integrated with the truck, maintaining the overall authenticity of the scene without introducing distracting or out-of-place elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The truck's wheels, being prominent features, should maintain their structural and visual coherence even after applying the new style. We need to confirm that the wheels' design, positioning, and connection to the truck remain logical and credible.",
      "question": "Do the wheels maintain their structural and physical logic, with no signs of distortion or misalignment, thereby preserving the truck's visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
