      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the butterfly’s wings with translucent petal-like patterns, this transformation involves altering the wing structure and material properties. The original wings have a detailed, natural pattern with defined veins and color gradients. The new petal-like design must maintain structural coherence and visual plausibility in terms of shape, transparency, and texture. The question evaluates whether the replacement preserves natural-looking translucency and avoids artificial or broken textures.",
      "question": "Do the petal-like wing structures appear translucent with smooth gradients and no jagged edges or unnatural pixelation?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies converting the antennae into golden tendrils that sparkle. In the original image, the antennae are thin, dark, and segmented. Replacing them with golden, sparkling tendrils introduces a new material (metallic gold) and dynamic effect (sparkle). This change must not disrupt the proportion or attachment point to the head, and the sparkle should be consistent with light interaction without introducing noise or artifacts.",
      "question": "Are the golden tendrils smoothly attached to the head, with consistent metallic sheen and visible sparkle effects that do not distort the surrounding area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The body of the butterfly is to be infused with colorful floral textures. The original body has a natural insect-like form with subtle coloration. Adding floral textures requires blending organic patterns while maintaining anatomical proportions. The evaluation focuses on whether the texture application distorts the body's shape or creates unnatural seams between materials.",
      "question": "Does the floral texture on the butterfly’s body follow the natural contours without warping or breaking the underlying shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The butterfly’s eyes are to become glowing sapphire orbs. Originally, the eyes are small and dark. Changing them to large, luminous orbs alters both size and material. This modification must preserve facial symmetry and avoid disproportionate enlargement or unnatural glow spillage into adjacent areas. The question checks for physical plausibility and artifact-free illumination.",
      "question": "Are the sapphire orb eyes symmetrically positioned and emitting a soft glow without bleeding into the head or causing halo artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "A starry trail is to be added as the butterfly hovers over lavender. This introduces a dynamic element not present in the original static scene. The trail must align with the butterfly’s motion direction and integrate naturally with lighting conditions. It should not appear as disconnected particles or exhibit unnatural brightness or sharpness.",
      "question": "Is the starry trail aligned with the butterfly’s position and orientation, with gradual fading and no abrupt edges or floating particles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The surroundings are to be changed to a dreamlike meadow with surreal floating blooms. The original background features blurred purple flowers and warm lighting. Introducing floating blooms requires modifying depth cues and spatial logic. The floating elements must not violate perspective or appear unnaturally suspended without support.",
      "question": "Are the floating blooms positioned at plausible distances from the ground and integrated with the lighting gradient without casting inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
