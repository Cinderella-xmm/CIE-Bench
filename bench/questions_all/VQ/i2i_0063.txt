Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of maintaining the cat's natural appearance while integrating it into an adventure-themed movie poster, we need to ensure that the cat retains its structural coherence and realistic texture despite being placed in a new environment.
Question: Does the cat maintain its structural coherence and natural texture, without showing any unnatural artifacts or distortions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: The editing instruction necessitates changing the background to a post-apocalyptic ruined city. This involves replacing the existing background which currently shows a bookshelf and remote control. We need to ensure the new background does not introduce any unrealistic elements that would disrupt the scene's authenticity.
Question: Is the new background of a ruined city seamlessly integrated, avoiding any visible breaks or inconsistencies that betray the editing?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: The title “LAST RIDE” should appear at the top of the image in an appropriate font and size that complements the theme. It is crucial that the text is legible and blends naturally with the rest of the image, ensuring that it doesn't overshadow the central figure—the cat.
Question: Does the text “LAST RIDE” appear natural and appropriately styled, without introducing any distracting elements that could detract from the image's overall harmony?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The instruction specifies applying a cool-tone filter to achieve a consistent aesthetic that matches the post-apocalyptic theme. The filter should enhance the mood of the scene without compromising the clarity and detail of the key elements like the cat and the ruined city.
Question: Has the cool-tone filter been applied evenly across the image, preserving the clarity and fine details of both the cat and the background?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Adding a film rating label requires careful placement so as not to clash with the main elements of the image. The label should be visually credible, neither too prominent nor inconspicuous, and should align with the movie poster's design conventions.
Question: Does the film rating label fit naturally within the composition of the image, complementing rather than disrupting the visual flow?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
