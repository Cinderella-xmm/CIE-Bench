Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction involves transforming rose petals into a luxury perfume bottle design, which requires replacing natural floral elements with artificial objects. This transformation affects the overall realism and natural appearance of the image, especially since the original image features organic rose petals that must now be converted into a structured glass bottle with etched patterns and metallic components. The transition from biological to manufactured materials introduces significant changes in texture, material properties, and geometric structure. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate whether the new elements maintain visual coherence with the surrounding environment and preserve structural integrity without introducing distortions or unnatural artifacts.

-Sub requirement 1: Evaluate whether the replacement of rose petals with a glass perfume bottle maintains structural consistency and visual credibility, particularly in terms of shape, proportion, and integration with the original background.
-Sub requirement 2: Assess whether the etched petal designs on the bottle surface appear as continuous, smooth patterns without pixelation, jagged edges, or broken lines, ensuring high perceptual quality.
-Sub requirement 3: Determine if the glossy gold rose-shaped cap appears physically plausible—specifically, whether its reflective surface and three-dimensional form are consistent with real-world materials and lighting conditions.
-Sub requirement 4: Check whether the deep crimson gradient inside the bottle is smoothly blended and free from banding, color shifts, or abrupt transitions that could indicate low-quality rendering.
-Sub requirement 5: Verify that the minimalist gold font logo placed vertically along the bottle's side is legible, properly aligned, and does not introduce any distortion or blurring that compromises clarity or realism.
-Sub requirement 6: Confirm that the overall composition of the edited image preserves depth and spatial relationships between the bottle and the original background, avoiding floating or misaligned elements.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of evaluating structural consistency and visual credibility when replacing rose petals with a glass perfume bottle, this question checks whether the new bottle integrates naturally into the scene by maintaining proper proportions and alignment with the original floral elements. The shape of the bottle must conform to physical laws (e.g., cylindrical symmetry) and avoid unnatural stretching or compression.
Question: Is the glass bottle positioned such that its base aligns with the original location of the rose petals and does not appear disproportionately large or small compared to surrounding elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement assessing the etched petal patterns on the bottle surface, this question evaluates whether the engraved details are rendered with smooth contours and uniform thickness, avoiding jagged edges or broken lines that would suggest digital artifacts or poor resolution.
Question: Are the petal etchings on the bottle surface continuous and evenly spaced, without visible gaps, pixelation, or irregular line breaks?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement regarding the glossy gold rose-shaped cap, this question examines whether the material properties of the cap—such as reflectivity, highlights, and curvature—are consistent with realistic metal finishes under ambient lighting, ensuring no flat or matte areas that break immersion.
Question: Does the gold rose-shaped cap exhibit realistic reflections and specular highlights that match the light source direction and do not appear overly shiny or uniformly colored?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement concerning the interior crimson gradient of the bottle, this question assesses whether the color transition within the liquid is smooth and free from banding or abrupt changes, which are common indicators of low-quality image processing or insufficient color depth.
Question: Is the deep crimson gradient inside the bottle smoothly blended across the vertical axis, without visible color bands or uneven transitions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement about the placement and appearance of the gold logo, this question ensures that the text is sharp, correctly oriented, and integrated into the bottle’s surface without distortion, blur, or misalignment that could compromise readability or realism.
Question: Is the vertical gold logo clearly legible, evenly spaced, and aligned along the side of the bottle without warping, fading, or overlapping with other elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
