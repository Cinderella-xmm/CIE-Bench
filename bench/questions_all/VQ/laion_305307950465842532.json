      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing clothing patterns with southwestern fabrics such as denim and woven textile designs, evaluate whether the texture and material of the clothing on both individuals appear natural and consistent with the described style. The original image shows a white jacket with flamingo embroidery and a patterned shirt on the left individual, and a light gray jacket on the right individual. The editing involves changing these to southwestern-style fabrics, which requires assessing if the new textures maintain realistic fabric properties (e.g., weave, drape, color variation) without introducing unnatural pixelation or artificial patterns.",
      "question": "Do the clothing materials on both individuals display natural fabric textures consistent with denim and woven southwestern textiles, without visible artifacts or inconsistent shading?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating cacti silhouettes and a setting sun into the wooden background, evaluate whether these added elements are seamlessly integrated into the existing wood panel backdrop. The original background features repeated \"FGL HOUSE\" text on horizontal wooden planks. Adding cacti and a sunset must not disrupt the alignment or lighting consistency of the wood panels or create visual discontinuities such as mismatched shadows or color bleeding.",
      "question": "Are the cacti silhouettes and setting sun elements blended naturally into the wooden background without causing misalignment, unnatural shadows, or color inconsistencies?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of emphasizing the band name with a handmade, distressed font, evaluate whether the new text overlay appears physically plausible and stylistically coherent with the vintage western theme. The original image includes a blue banner at the bottom with clean sans-serif text. Replacing this with a distressed font must preserve legibility while avoiding distortions such as broken letters, uneven spacing, or texture that appears digitally over-applied rather than aged.",
      "question": "Does the new band name text in the banner use a distressed font style that appears handcrafted and consistent with the western theme, without jagged edges or unnatural texture application?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding cowboy boots and hats as thematic elements, evaluate whether these objects are proportionally accurate and spatially coherent within the composition. The original image already includes a wide-brimmed hat on the left individual. Adding additional cowboy boots or hats must respect physical scale, perspective, and placement so they do not appear floating or improperly scaled relative to the subjects or background.",
      "question": "Are any newly added cowboy boots or hats positioned with correct proportions and perspective relative to the individuals and background, without appearing distorted or detached from the scene?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring overall layout cohesion and inviting feel, evaluate whether the arrangement of all elements—clothing, background, text, and added props—creates a balanced and visually credible composition. The original image has a centered, symmetrical pose with clear subject focus. The edited version must maintain this balance while integrating new elements without overcrowding or misalignment.",
      "question": "Is the overall layout of the edited image balanced, with all added elements (text, props, background details) properly aligned and spaced to avoid visual clutter or imbalance?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
