      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of evaluating whether morphed plants retain plausible biological forms despite transformation into whimsical characters, this question checks for distortion in plant anatomy. The original image includes banana-like plants, ferns, and succulents with defined leaf shapes and growth patterns. Any addition of limbs, faces, or exaggerated features should not break natural symmetry or proportion.",
      "question": "Do the transformed plants maintain recognizable plant-like structures without unnatural appendages or disproportionate body parts?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement assessing whether added vine patterns on leaves appear integrated with natural surfaces, this question examines texture consistency. The large banana leaves in the foreground have smooth, matte surfaces with visible veins. Overlaying intricate vine designs must match the lighting and roughness of the original leaf surface.",
      "question": "Are the vine patterns on the leaves seamlessly blended with the leaf texture, showing no visible edges, clipping, or inconsistent shading?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement determining whether magical orbs maintain natural lighting interaction and spatial consistency with surrounding foliage, this question focuses on flower replacements. The original image shows clusters of pink and red flowers in pots near the center-right area. Replacing them with glowing orbs must preserve their placement and casting appropriate reflections or glows.",
      "question": "Do the magical orbs replace the original flowers in the same positions and emit light that interacts realistically with nearby surfaces and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement checking whether floating shelves exhibit proper depth cues and shadow alignment, this question evaluates the physical plausibility of suspended platforms. The original shelves are mounted on wheels and rest on stone flooring. Removing contact points and introducing floatation requires consistent shadow direction and ambient occlusion.",
      "question": "Are the shelves positioned above the ground with soft shadows beneath them that align with the light source and do not show unnatural gaps or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement verifying whether the cascading foliage maintains structural continuity with the roof framework, this question examines the transformation of the glass ceiling. The original roof consists of triangular glass panes supported by metal beams. Replacing it with a downward-flowing iridescent canopy must respect the underlying geometry and allow light to pass through appropriately.",
      "question": "Does the iridescent foliage cascade from the ceiling in a way that follows the structural lines of the roof frame and allows light to diffuse naturally through its layers?",
