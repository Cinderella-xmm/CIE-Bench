      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Considering the sub requirement to extend the cat's head out of the frame, we need to assess if the head's extension maintains visual coherence with the rest of the body without introducing noticeable artifacts or distortions. The goal is to verify the authenticity and structural consistency of the cat's head as it appears to extend outwards.",
      "question": "Does the cat's head extend naturally out of the frame without any visible artifacts or unrealistic stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "To address the requirement for the curled tongue to show clear spatial depth, the focus shifts to whether the tongue integrates smoothly with the face and exhibits a natural texture and three-dimensional look. This entails ensuring that the tongue's appearance does not detract from the overall realism and naturalness of the image.",
      "question": "Is the curled tongue depicted with natural texture and spatial depth, enhancing the illusion of it peeking out from the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The authenticity of the cat's overall appearance relies on maintaining consistent lighting and shadow across its body after editing. We need to examine if the extended head and curled tongue preserve the lighting effects that align with the rest of the image, thereby avoiding any visual inconsistencies.",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadow on the cat's extended head and curled tongue consistent with the rest of the image, contributing to a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Given the requirement to maintain structural coherence and visual plausibility, it's crucial to ensure that the cat's features like eyes, ears, and whiskers remain undistorted and proportionate. Checking these details confirms the absence of unnatural deformations and retains the overall integrity of the image.",
      "question": "Do the cat's eyes, ears, and whiskers appear proportionate and undistorted, contributing to the visual plausibility of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The editing instruction aims to create an illusionary effect while preserving the cat's core elements such as fur texture and color. Ensuring that these elements retain their original characteristics contributes significantly to the overall authenticity and realism of the edited image.",
      "question": "Does the cat's fur texture and color remain natural and unaltered, ensuring the visual authenticity of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
