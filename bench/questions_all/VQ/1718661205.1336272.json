      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the military ship with gray and blue LEGO bricks, this involves transforming a complex naval vessel into a block-based structure. The focus is on whether the ship's silhouette, superstructure, and hull retain proportional accuracy and geometric coherence when rendered in LEGO form. The evaluation includes checking for distorted shapes, incorrect scaling, or broken modular alignment.",
      "question": "Does the LEGO version of the military ship maintain its original shape and structural proportions without visible distortions or misaligned brick patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the ocean waves with blue LEGO bricks, this transformation affects the fluid dynamics of water. The evaluation focuses on whether the wave forms appear physically plausible when constructed from discrete blocks, avoiding unnaturally flat or rigid patterns that contradict the appearance of moving water.",
      "question": "Are the LEGO-rendered ocean waves shaped in a way that mimics natural wave motion, without appearing overly rigid or uniformly flat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of constructing the boatâ€™s deck with small detailed LEGO accessories, this involves assessing the fidelity and scale of the deck components. The evaluation checks whether the deck elements (e.g., railings, hatches, equipment) are appropriately sized and placed relative to the character and the surrounding environment, ensuring logical spatial consistency.",
      "question": "Are the LEGO accessories used for the boat deck properly scaled and positioned to match the size and perspective of the character and the surrounding scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the life vest and shirt with LEGO textures and shapes while retaining color, this involves evaluating the material transition. The focus is on whether the fabric-like appearance of the clothing is convincingly replaced with LEGO-style textures without introducing unnatural seams, color bleeding, or loss of fine detail.",
      "question": "Do the LEGO-textured life vest and shirt retain their original colors and show no signs of unnatural texture repetition, pixelation, or mismatched edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the LEGO model within a minimalist shelf display, this involves assessing the integration of the diorama into a new context. The evaluation checks whether the shelf is visually consistent with the model, including proper depth, lighting, and shadow alignment, and whether the placement appears intentional and not forced.",
      "question": "Is the LEGO model positioned on a shelf that appears structurally sound and spatially coherent, with appropriate shadows and depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency and avoiding artifacts across all transformed elements, this involves checking for common issues such as jagged edges, floating bricks, or missing details. The evaluation ensures that each LEGO component is cleanly rendered and fits together logically.",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, misaligned bricks, or missing pieces in the LEGO model that break the illusion of a cohesive construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
