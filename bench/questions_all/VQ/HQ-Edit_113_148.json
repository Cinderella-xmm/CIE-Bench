      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the sandcastle into a translucent crystal structure with faceted surfaces and soft blue highlights, this question evaluates whether the material transition maintains structural coherence and physical plausibility. The original sandcastle has distinct towers and turrets; the edited version must preserve these shapes while replacing sand with crystal. The focus is on whether the facets are evenly distributed, the transparency is consistent, and there are no broken edges or missing parts.",
      "question": "Are the crystal facets on the sandcastle uniformly shaped and aligned with the original tower geometry, without any jagged or incomplete edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing seashells with pastel-colored gemstones, this question assesses whether the new objects have a natural, polished appearance and are properly integrated into the scene. The shells are located near the base of the castle and in shallow water. The gemstones must match their size and distribution while avoiding unnatural sheen or floating effects.",
      "question": "Do the gemstones replace the seashells accurately in position and size, and do they exhibit smooth, reflective surfaces without floating above the sand or water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the ocean into an etched wave pattern on frosted glass, this question evaluates whether the surface texture realistically simulates glass and maintains wave-like patterns. The original ocean had motion and foam; the new version must convey similar forms through etching. The focus is on continuity of lines and consistency of frosting.",
      "question": "Is the wave pattern on the frosted glass surface continuous and flowing, with no abrupt breaks or unnatural line interruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the scene inside a minimalist gallery display case, this question checks whether the enclosure is visually consistent and does not distort the scene. The case should be transparent and frame the content without cutting off elements or creating reflection anomalies.",
      "question": "Are the edges of the display case visible and straight, with no clipping or warping of the internal elements, and do they align with the perspective of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of evaluating the shovel’s compatibility with the new environment, this question checks whether the object remains intact and logically positioned. The shovel is in the foreground, partially submerged in water. In the new setting, it must either remain unchanged or be rendered consistently with the glass case.",
      "question": "Is the red shovel with yellow handle fully visible and undistorted, lying flat on the surface without intersecting or appearing behind glass where it shouldn’t be?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
