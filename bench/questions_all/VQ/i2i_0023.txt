Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of maintaining the structural coherence and visual plausibility while enlarging the boyâ€™s head and shrinking the birds, we must ensure that these alterations maintain realistic proportions and avoid any unnatural distortions.
Question: Are the enlarged head of the boy and the shrunken birds proportionate and structurally coherent, avoiding any noticeable distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Evaluating the instruction regarding converting the photo into a minimalist flat illustration and applying block colors while retaining outlines, we assess if the transition from realistic textures to block colors introduces any unnatural artifacts.
Question: Do the block colors used for the boy's skin tone and feather textures appear clean and uniform, without introducing unnatural artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement to add a thick white outline around the boy and birds while removing the background, we must ensure that the edges of the subjects remain smooth and consistent against the transparent background, preserving the natural appearance.
Question: Are the white outlines around the boy and birds smooth and consistent, without jagged edges or unnatural breaks?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Addressing the sub requirement of keeping all bird outlines intact while shrinking them, we should verify that the reduction in size does not damage the fine details or textures, ensuring they still look natural despite being smaller.
Question: Do the shrunken birds retain their fine details and textures naturally, without losing clarity or appearing pixelated?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of having a neat arrangement after enlarging the boy's head and shrinking the birds, the composition should maintain visual credibility and a balanced aesthetic.
Question: Does the composition with the enlarged boy's head and shrunken birds appear balanced and neatly arranged, providing visual credibility?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
