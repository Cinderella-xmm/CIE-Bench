Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the cityscape into a watercolor style while preserving warm pink and blue tones. This involves stylistic modification across the entire image, particularly affecting the texture, color blending, and edge definition of buildings, water, sky, and mountains. The original image has a painterly oil-like texture with defined brushstrokes; converting it to watercolor must maintain visual coherence without introducing unnatural textures or color bleeding that breaks spatial logic.
-Sub requirement 1: Transform the cityscape (entire background including rooftops, sea, mountains, and sky) into a watercolor style while preserving dominant warm pink and blue hues—evaluate whether this conversion maintains natural appearance, avoids artificial textures, and preserves structural consistency.

-<Thinking Process 2>: An anthropomorphic cat character must be added wearing a striped sailor shirt and beret, positioned on one of the rooftops in the foreground. The character’s placement must align with the perspective and scale of surrounding buildings. Its inclusion must not distort nearby architectural elements or create depth inconsistencies.
-Sub requirement 2: Add an anthropomorphic cat character on a rooftop in the lower right quadrant of the image (near the prominent bell tower), ensuring its proportions match the scale of buildings, and its clothing and posture appear physically plausible and integrated into the scene.

-<Thinking Process 3>: Text must be added: 'Pepper the Cat's Neapolitan Adventure: Searching for the Legendary Vesuvian Treasure.' The text should be legible and placed in a way that does not obstruct key visual elements like the horizon or central structures. It should follow a narrative layout typical of storybook pages.
-Sub requirement 3: Insert text at the top or bottom margin of the image, ensuring it is readable, stylistically consistent with a storybook theme, and does not overlap critical visual features such as the bell tower or skyline.

-<Thinking Process 4>: Decorative borders resembling Italian tile patterns must be added along all four edges of the page. These borders should frame the artwork without distorting the image or appearing misaligned.
-Sub requirement 4: Apply decorative tile-patterned borders along the outer edges of the image, ensuring they are symmetrical, continuous, and do not interfere with the painted content or introduce visible seams or misalignments.

-<Thinking Process 5>: The overall composition must remain visually coherent, with no artifacts from digital manipulation such as jagged edges, ghosting, or mismatched lighting. The addition of new elements (character, text, border) must not break the continuity of shadows, lighting direction, or color harmony established in the original painting.
-Sub requirement 5: Ensure all added elements (character, text, border) integrate seamlessly with the original image in terms of lighting, shadow, and color balance, avoiding any visual discontinuity or unnatural contrasts.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the cityscape into a watercolor style while preserving warm pink and blue tones, evaluate whether the texture and color transitions across the sky, sea, buildings, and mountains appear consistent with watercolor techniques—specifically checking for smooth gradients, soft edges, and absence of hard lines or digital artifacts.
Question: Are the color transitions in the sky, sea, and buildings smooth and free of sharp digital edges or unnatural color patches?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding an anthropomorphic cat character on a rooftop near the bell tower, evaluate whether the character's size, posture, and clothing (striped sailor shirt, beret) are proportionally correct relative to the surrounding buildings and do not distort the roofline or adjacent structures.
Question: Is the anthropomorphic cat character positioned on a rooftop with correct scale relative to nearby buildings, and does it have a natural pose without deformed limbs or distorted anatomy?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding text in a storybook-style format, evaluate whether the text is clearly visible, properly aligned along the margin, and does not overlap or obscure important visual elements such as the bell tower or horizon line.
Question: Is the text 'Pepper the Cat's Neapolitan Adventure: Searching for the Legendary Vesuvian Treasure' fully visible, positioned within the margin area, and not overlapping with key architectural features?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding Italian tile-patterned borders along the edges, evaluate whether the borders are uniformly applied, symmetrical, and do not interrupt the painted content or introduce visible seams or misalignment.
Question: Are the decorative borders along all four edges of the image continuous, symmetrical, and free of gaps or misaligned tiles?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining visual coherence and avoiding artifacts, evaluate whether the lighting and shadows across the newly added elements (cat, text, border) match the ambient lighting of the original scene, especially in terms of direction and intensity.
Question: Do the shadows and highlights on the added cat character and border elements align with the light source direction seen in the sky and buildings?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
