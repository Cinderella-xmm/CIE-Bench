      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the spines with crystal shards across the cactus surface, this question evaluates whether the new material integrates naturally with the cactus's geometry and lighting. Crystal shards should match the original spine density and radial pattern, reflect light realistically, and not introduce floating or misaligned fragments.",
      "question": "Are the crystal shards aligned with the cactus ribs and uniformly distributed without gaps or overlapping clusters?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding luminous glyphs on the green surface, this question checks whether the glyphs follow the natural segmentation of the cactus and emit light without distorting the surface. Glyphs should be integrated into the ridges without breaking the continuity of the skin texture.",
      "question": "Do the luminous glyphs follow the rib lines of the cactus and emit a soft glow without causing overexposure or halo effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reshaping the terracotta pot into a sandstone pedestal, this question assesses whether the new material and form maintain physical plausibility. The pedestal should rest flatly on the wooden surface, have consistent texture, and not appear warped or disconnected.",
      "question": "Is the sandstone pedestal fully grounded on the wooden surface with natural texture and no floating or clipped edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of embedding amber eyes within the cactus ribs, this question evaluates whether the eyes are positioned within the rib grooves without deforming the cactus surface. The internal glow should be contained and not bleed into adjacent areas.",
      "question": "Are the amber eyes embedded within the cactus ribs at symmetrical positions and do they show internal illumination without distorting the surrounding tissue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding vine tendrils and desert flowers around the base, this question checks whether the vines wrap naturally around the pedestal and connect seamlessly with the environment. The flowers should be proportionally small and attached without floating or unnatural angles.",
      "question": "Do the vine tendrils curve naturally around the pedestal and connect smoothly to the base without floating or rigid positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
