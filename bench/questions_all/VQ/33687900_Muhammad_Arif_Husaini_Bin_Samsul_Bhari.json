      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the waterfall into an ethereal water spirit with flowing, crystalline hair cascading from its head, evaluate whether the new form maintains structural coherence with the original waterfall’s vertical flow and rock formations. The editing position is the central cascade area (from top of the waterfall to the base pool), where the water's shape must transition naturally into a humanoid figure without breaking geometric continuity or introducing unnatural distortions in the flow lines.",
      "question": "Does the crystalline hair of the water spirit follow the natural downward trajectory of the original waterfall, maintaining smooth, continuous flow lines that align with the surrounding rock contours?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of blending the spirit’s form seamlessly with the rocky surroundings and embodying a luminescent blue hue, assess whether the color transition between the spirit and the rocks is gradual and physically plausible. The editing position is the interface between the spirit’s body and the adjacent cliff face, where abrupt color shifts or artificial glows could break realism.",
      "question": "Is the luminescent blue hue of the water spirit evenly distributed and softly blended into the surrounding gray and dark rock surfaces without sharp edges or unnatural color bleeding?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding vine-like appendages resembling the surrounding foliage, adorned with delicate floral patterns, evaluate whether these appendages emerge organically from the spirit’s form and match the texture and scale of real plant life. The editing position is the mid-to-lower section of the spirit’s body, where vines should appear as extensions of nearby ferns and tropical plants.",
      "question": "Do the vine-like appendages have consistent leaf shapes, spacing, and textures that match the surrounding vegetation, and do they grow naturally from the spirit’s body without floating or misaligned joints?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the pool at the base with a mystical, glowing basin reflecting vibrant, cascading waves of energy, assess whether the new basin maintains physical plausibility in terms of surface reflection, depth, and interaction with light. The editing position is the bottom of the waterfall where the water would normally pool, now transformed into a glowing basin.",
      "question": "Does the glowing basin reflect light in a way that matches the direction of the falling water and surrounding environment, showing coherent wave patterns and no flat or uniform glow that contradicts natural light behavior?",

The editing position is the entire volume of the spirit, particularly areas where crystal facets meet the air or rock.",
      "question": "Are the crystalline surfaces of the spirit composed of clear, defined facets with realistic light refraction and shadowing, avoiding pixelation, smudging, or repetitive patterns that suggest digital artifacting?",
