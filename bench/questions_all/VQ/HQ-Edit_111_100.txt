Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the wooden warrior statue into a LEGO creation using brown and tan bricks, evaluate whether the material transition from wood to LEGO bricks maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. Specifically, check if the surface texture of the statue now exhibits consistent brick-like patterns without unnatural blending or texture degradation, especially in areas like the chest armor, helmet, and limbs where intricate details were present in the original.
Question: Does the entire surface of the LEGO statue display uniform brick textures with no visible patches of residual wood grain or inconsistent material transitions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using smooth bricks for armor and textured ones for intricate designs, assess whether the different brick types are appropriately assigned to match the original designâ€™s complexity. Focus on high-detail areas such as the headdress, neck collar, and belt ornamentation to determine if fine LEGO elements accurately represent the original carvings without simplification or distortion.
Question: Are the detailed carvings on the headdress, chest plate, and belt represented by small, precisely placed LEGO bricks that preserve the original patterns without loss of detail?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining proportion and physical rationality, evaluate whether the LEGO statue retains the correct human proportions and anatomical structure. Pay special attention to limb length, head-to-body ratio, and joint articulation, ensuring no elongation, compression, or geometric distortion occurred during conversion.
Question: Do the arms, legs, and torso of the LEGO statue maintain natural human proportions with correctly scaled joints and limbs?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts such as unnatural textures or broken geometry, examine the hands of the statue. Check if each hand has exactly five fingers with proper spacing, curvature, and brick alignment, and whether any fingers appear fused, misshapen, or missing due to editing errors.
Question: Do both hands of the LEGO statue have five distinct fingers with natural finger positioning and no signs of merging or deformation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of positioning the LEGO statue on a minimalist white pedestal inside a gallery setting, evaluate whether the base supports the statue properly and integrates naturally into the environment. Check for alignment, shadow consistency, and reflection accuracy on the floor to ensure the pedestal appears physically plausible and not artificially inserted.
Question: Is the LEGO statue centered on a flat white pedestal with realistic shadows and reflections that align with the lighting direction in the gallery?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
