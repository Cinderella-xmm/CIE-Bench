Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility while converting the original image into a Chibi Ghibli cartoon style, we need to assess if the character's proportions and physical rationality remain intact despite the stylistic transformation.
Question: Are the character's proportions in each sticker consistent with the Chibi style without any unnatural distortion or broken geometric shapes?
Choices: Yes, No

Question: Do the textures of the character's clothing and painting tools appear natural and detailed in the Chibi stickers?
Choices: Yes, No

Question: Are the colors in the Chibi stickers vibrant and consistent with the Chibi Ghibli cartoon style?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: To ensure the absence of obvious artifacts and the preservation of structural consistency, we must check if the background of each sticker is transparent and if there are no extraneous pieces or artifacts present.
