Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction specifies transforming the figure into a chibi-style decorative resin bust, which involves significant stylistic and structural changes from the original realistic portrait. This transformation affects overall proportions, facial features, clothing details, and material representation. The chibi style typically includes exaggerated head-to-body ratios, simplified facial lines, and stylized textures—each of which must be evaluated for visual coherence and authenticity in relation to the original image’s elements. The original image features a young woman with detailed facial structure, natural skin tones, intricate jewelry, a striped headdress, embroidered robe, and a pomegranate held in her hands. These elements must be reinterpreted in a stylized form while maintaining visual plausibility as a resin bust.
-Sub requirement 1: Transforming the figure into a chibi-style resin bust alters the proportion of the head and body; evaluate whether the new proportions maintain structural coherence and avoid unnatural distortions such as elongated limbs or disproportionately large heads.
-Sub requirement 2: The facial features are to be simplified with minimalistic lines; assess whether this simplification preserves recognizable identity and avoids losing key facial landmarks like eyes, nose, and mouth in a way that compromises visual credibility.
-Sub requirement 3: The embroidered brown robe is to feature exaggerated patterns; check if the patterns remain coherent with textile logic and do not introduce artificial or broken textures.
-Sub requirement 4: The colorful headdress with vivid stripes is to be retained but stylized; determine whether the color saturation and stripe continuity are preserved without introducing jagged edges or unnatural blending.
-Sub requirement 5: The pomegranate is to be made glossy; verify that the gloss effect is applied uniformly and realistically without creating unnatural reflections or highlights that violate light physics.
-Sub requirement 6: The bust is to sit atop a smooth wooden base; confirm that the base is structurally consistent with the bust and does not appear floating or misaligned.
-Sub requirement 7: The hand holding the pomegranate must retain anatomical accuracy; ensure that the number of fingers is correct (five), and that joint angles and finger positioning conform to ergonomic principles.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the figure into a chibi-style resin bust with altered proportions, evaluate whether the head-to-body ratio is exaggerated but still maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. Specifically, check if the head appears disproportionately large compared to the torso, and whether limbs are shortened appropriately without breaking geometric continuity.
Question: Does the bust have a visibly coherent head-to-body proportion where the head is enlarged relative to the torso but remains structurally plausible?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of simplifying facial features with minimalistic lines, assess whether the facial structure retains identifiable features such as eyes, nose, and mouth, and whether these are drawn with clean, non-distorted lines that do not cause loss of recognition or unnatural shape.
Question: Are the facial features simplified but still clearly defined, with no missing or distorted elements such as eyes or mouth?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of exaggerating patterns on the embroidered brown robe, evaluate whether the patterns are stylized but still follow logical textile design rules—such as consistent repetition, alignment, and texture—and do not exhibit pixelation, broken lines, or unnatural color separation.
Question: Do the embroidered patterns on the robe appear continuous and logically structured, without jagged edges or disrupted textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of enhancing the headdress with vivid stripes, check whether the colors and stripes remain consistent across the fabric, with no abrupt color shifts, unnatural blending, or visible seams that suggest digital artifacts.
Question: Are the stripes on the headdress evenly spaced and smoothly colored, without visible artifacts such as color bleeding or misalignment?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of making the pomegranate shine with gloss, evaluate whether the gloss effect is applied uniformly, with highlights that follow light direction and do not create unrealistic reflections or over-saturation.
Question: Does the pomegranate have a glossy surface with natural-looking highlights that do not distort its shape or create false reflections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the bust on a smooth wooden base, verify that the base is physically connected to the bust and aligned properly, without gaps or floating appearance, and that the wood texture appears uniform and consistent with real materials.
Question: Is the wooden base fully attached to the bust and visually grounded, with no floating or misaligned sections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q7: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving anatomical accuracy in the hand holding the pomegranate, check whether the hand has five fingers, proper joint curvature, and natural spacing between fingers, and whether there are no extra digits or unnatural bends.
Question: Does the hand holding the pomegranate have exactly five fingers with natural joint angles and no deformation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
