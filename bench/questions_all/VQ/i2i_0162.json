      "question": "Does the mouse's fur texture appear smooth and maintain the natural look expected in a Pixar-style animation without unnatural or overly simplified patterns?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring the structural coherence and visual plausibility of the mouseâ€™s body, we examine if the proportions and physical characteristics remain consistent with a real mouse after the style transformation.",
      "question": "Are the mouse's ears, eyes, and whiskers proportionally correct and not distorted relative to its body size in the Pixar animation style?",

      "thinking_process": "Given the focus on enhancing cartoon texture and soft shadowing, we assess the shadows under the mouse and around the crumbs to verify if they contribute positively to the authenticity and avoid creating distracting artifacts.",
      "question": "Do the soft shadows under the mouse and surrounding crumbs appear naturally integrated into the scene without any harsh or misplaced artifacts?",

      "question": "Does the floor's texture retain sufficient detail and pattern authenticity in the Pixar animation style, avoiding unnatural smoothing or artificial patterns?",
