Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the chicken wings into plush toy replicas with golden-brown fabric and a slightly crunchy texture, evaluate whether the material transformation maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original chicken wings have distinct shapes and textures (crispy skin, bone structure), so replacing them with plush toys must preserve their general form while introducing fabric-like texture. The question checks if the shape of each wing remains consistent with its original anatomical structure (e.g., drumettes, flats) and whether the fabric texture appears natural without visible seams or distortions.
Question: Do the plush toy versions of the chicken wings retain the correct anatomical shape and proportions of real wings, such as the joint areas and wing tips, without deformation or unnatural stretching?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the sauce with a soft, textured pillow in bright orange to mimic its appearance, assess whether the replacement object maintains physical plausibility and avoids artifacts. The original sauce is in a small white bowl and has a smooth, viscous consistency. Replacing it with a pillow must preserve the bowl’s shape and size but alter the content to resemble a soft textile object. The question evaluates whether the pillow conforms to the bowl’s dimensions and whether its texture appears natural and not digitally warped.
Question: Is the bright orange pillow placed inside the white bowl properly scaled and shaped to fit within the bowl's boundaries without bulging or distorting the bowl’s edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of setting all elements on a smooth, light-colored wooden surface to contrast the plush details, evaluate whether the background surface change preserves geometric consistency and visual credibility. The original image features a dark blue-gray textured surface. Changing it to a light-colored wooden surface must maintain flatness and uniformity without introducing artificial patterns or shadows inconsistent with lighting. This question checks for natural wood grain and even tone across the surface.
Question: Does the light-colored wooden surface appear uniformly smooth with natural wood grain patterns and no visible digital artifacts or abrupt color shifts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of giving the plush chicken wings a "slightly crunchy texture," assess whether the texture applied to the fabric mimics a tactile quality that aligns with the concept of “crunchy” without contradicting the soft nature of plush materials. This involves evaluating if the texture appears layered or embossed in a way that suggests crunchiness, yet still looks like fabric rather than food or plastic.
Question: Does the golden-brown fabric of the plush wings display a subtle raised or granular texture that visually suggests a crunchy feel, while remaining consistent with the appearance of soft textile material?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the sauce with a pillow, evaluate whether the composition of the scene remains visually credible. The original placement of the sauce cup near the bottom right of the plate must be preserved in terms of position and spatial relationship to the wings. The pillow should not float or overlap incorrectly with the wings or plate edge. This ensures layout logic and depth perception remain intact.
Question: Is the orange pillow positioned in the same location relative to the plate and wings as the original sauce was, maintaining proper alignment and depth without overlapping or floating above the plate?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
