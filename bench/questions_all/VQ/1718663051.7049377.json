      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the lone tree into an Art Deco stained glass panel with geometric contours for branches, evaluate whether the tree’s structure maintains structural coherence and visual credibility after stylization. The original image shows a naturally shaped tree with organic branching patterns; converting it to geometric contours must preserve its overall silhouette and avoid distorted or broken shapes that compromise plausibility.",
      "question": "Are the branches of the tree composed of clean, angular geometric lines consistent with Art Deco style, without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in the structure?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using muted colors for grass, assess whether the grass area has been altered to reflect muted tones while retaining natural texture and avoiding artificial or overly flat coloration. The original image features a textured grassy field under moonlight; any editing should maintain visible texture variation and subtle tonal shifts.",
      "question": "Does the grass in the foreground display muted, uniform coloration with preserved textural details such as individual blades or soft gradients, rather than appearing uniformly flat or artificially colored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering mountains in angular forms with bronze and teal shades, evaluate whether the mountain range in the background has been transformed into sharp, geometric shapes that still align with physical logic and spatial depth. The original mountains are softly rounded and layered; conversion to angular forms must not disrupt depth perception or create impossible geometries.",
      "question": "Are the mountain silhouettes composed of defined angular planes in bronze and teal tones, maintaining layered depth and spatial consistency without overlapping or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of creating a gradient sky with accentuated lines reflecting vintage elegance, assess whether the sky retains a smooth gradient from dark to light while incorporating stylized linear elements that do not appear forced or disruptive. The original sky contains stars and a soft glow behind the tree; any added lines must integrate seamlessly without breaking the natural flow.",
      "question": "Does the sky feature a smooth gradient from dark at the top to lighter near the horizon, with thin, evenly spaced accent lines that follow the curvature of the scene without intersecting or distorting the starfield?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining overall authenticity through material and style consistency, evaluate whether the stained glass effect is applied uniformly across the tree and background elements without introducing inconsistent textures or transparency artifacts. The original image has solid forms; transitioning to stained glass must preserve opacity and avoid ghosting or mismatched borders.",
      "question": "Are all elements—tree, mountains, and sky—rendered with consistent stained glass-style outlines and fills, lacking transparent patches, misaligned edges, or inconsistent shading within the same layer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
