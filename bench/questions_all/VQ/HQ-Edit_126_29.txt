Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the clock face with a page-turning book animation, evaluate whether the new element maintains structural coherence with the surrounding wooden casing and glass panel. The replacement involves altering a central functional component of the grandfather clock, which must preserve geometric integrity and material consistency (wood, glass, metal) to avoid visual artifacts such as misaligned edges, unnatural lighting reflections, or texture mismatches.
Question: Does the book animation on the clock face align perfectly with the curved top and vertical frame of the clock, maintaining consistent proportions and smooth transitions between materials?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding text snippets detailing historical timekeeping milestones on the wallpaper, assess whether the newly added text integrates naturally into the existing floral patterned wallpaper without disrupting its texture or causing visible distortions. The text should appear as if it were part of the original design, avoiding pixelation, blurring, or inconsistent lighting.
Question: Are the text snippets embedded in the wallpaper clearly legible, evenly spaced, and seamlessly blended into the background pattern without creating unnatural shadows or color shifts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of modifying the picture frame to show an ancient sundial image, evaluate whether the new image within the frame matches the style, lighting, and resolution of the original painting. The frame’s golden border and ornate details must remain intact, and the internal image should not exhibit warping, stretching, or chromatic aberrations that break realism.
Question: Is the image of the ancient sundial inside the framed artwork properly scaled, centered, and rendered with consistent lighting and depth relative to the original frame and surrounding wall?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of incorporating stylized clock hands made of pen imagery into the book cover design, assess whether the pen-shaped hands are proportionally accurate, anatomically plausible for writing instruments, and correctly positioned within the book's cover. The integration should not cause deformation of the book’s spine or pages, nor introduce floating or disconnected elements.
Question: Do the pen-shaped clock hands appear structurally sound, properly aligned with the book’s cover, and free from distortion such as bent metal parts or mismatched shadows?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using elegant serif fonts in art-nouveau style throughout the setting, evaluate whether the added captions maintain consistent font style, size, and placement across different surfaces (e.g., mantelpiece, rug, wall). These elements must not interfere with existing objects, cast unnatural shadows, or disrupt surface textures like wood grain or fabric weave.
Question: Are the captions placed in the room clearly readable, stylistically consistent with art-nouveau design, and physically integrated into their respective surfaces without overlapping or distorting underlying materials?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
