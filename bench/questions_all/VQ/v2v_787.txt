Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of retaining the original facial details and pose of the character while creating a 3D Q-style character, we need to ensure that the character's face retains its natural appearance and structural consistency despite the stylization. The original image shows a clear and detailed face which should be reflected in the 3D model.
Question: Does the 3D character's face retain the original facial details and proportions without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility, especially regarding the chibi-like long-legged proportions, we need to ensure that these proportions do not introduce geometric distortions or break the visual credibility of the character. The original image provides a natural human body structure which should be adapted into the chibi style without losing coherence.
Question: Are the chibi-like long-legged proportions of the 3D character visually plausible and structurally coherent, avoiding unnatural geometric distortions?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of designing the outfit and accessories to represent the profession of a fashion designer, incorporating the green and burnt orange hues from the original image, we need to ensure that the colors and materials used in the 3D model maintain a natural appearance and avoid introducing unnatural textures or loss of detail. The original image shows a well-coordinated outfit which should be reflected in the 3D design.
Question: Do the outfit and accessories of the 3D character incorporate the green and burnt orange hues naturally, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of detail?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement of ensuring the outfit incorporates fashion-forward accessories that coordinate with the original clothing, we need to verify if the accessories like glasses, a tablet or sketchbook, and fashionable footwear are integrated seamlessly into the 3D character without disrupting the overall authenticity and natural appearance. The original image provides a basis for the color coordination which should be preserved.
Question: Are the fashion-forward accessories like glasses, a tablet or sketchbook, and footwear integrated seamlessly into the 3D character, maintaining overall authenticity and natural appearance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of using a solid background color to complement and highlight the character's overall color scheme, we need to ensure that the background does not introduce any distractions or artifacts and complements the character effectively. The original image has a neutral background which should be adapted into a solid color that enhances the character.
Question: Does the solid background color complement and highlight the 3D character's overall color scheme without introducing any distracting artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
