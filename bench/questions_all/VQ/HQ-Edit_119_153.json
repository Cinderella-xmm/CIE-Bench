      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a crystal cloche enclosing the entire birdhouse structure, this question evaluates whether the cloche's transparency and refractive properties appear physically plausible. The cloche must show consistent curvature, proper light bending, and no abrupt edges or pixelation that would suggest digital artifacting.",
      "question": "Does the crystal cloche have smooth, continuous curvature with natural light refraction and no visible seams or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the roof with sapphire shingles and gold detailing, this question checks if the new color and decorative elements integrate naturally into the existing roof structure. The gold details must follow the architectural lines and not appear as flat overlays or inconsistent highlights.",
      "question": "Are the sapphire-colored shingles uniformly textured and do the gold details follow the roof’s architectural contours without appearing artificially painted or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding miniature flower beds at the entrance, this question assesses whether the flower beds are proportionally accurate and visually consistent with the surrounding environment. They must appear three-dimensional and rooted in the ground, not flattened or misaligned.",
      "question": "Do the flower beds at the entrance have natural plant textures, correct scale relative to the birdhouse, and sit flush with the ground surface without floating or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of inserting tiny woodland creatures through windows, this question examines whether the creatures are properly occluded by the window frame, cast appropriate shadows, and match the lighting conditions of the scene. They must not appear outside the window or lack depth.",
      "question": "Are the woodland creatures visible only through the window openings, positioned behind glass, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with the ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the flat base with a grassy mound, this question evaluates whether the mound has natural terrain features such as gentle slopes, realistic grass texture, and a stable connection to the birdhouse structure. It must not appear disconnected or structurally implausible.",
      "question": "Does the grassy mound have natural undulations, consistent grass coverage, and a seamless transition to the birdhouse base without gaps or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining magical realism through consistent lighting and material interaction, this question checks whether all elements—cloche, roof, flowers, creatures, and mound—share the same lighting direction, shadow behavior, and material response to light. Inconsistencies would break visual credibility.",
      "question": "Do all added elements (cloche, flowers, creatures, mound) respond to light consistently with the same direction and intensity as the original birdhouse and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
