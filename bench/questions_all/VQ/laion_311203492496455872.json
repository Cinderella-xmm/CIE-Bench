      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the visible hairstyle into an exaggerated, swirling cotton candy form with pastel pink and blue hues, emphasizing fluffiness, this involves a significant style conversion of the hair region. The original image shows natural white hair with realistic texture and volume. The edited version must maintain structural coherence in the hair's shape while introducing stylized elements. This transformation risks introducing unnatural textures, inconsistent color gradients, or broken geometric forms if not properly rendered. Therefore, the evaluation focuses on whether the new hair maintains visual plausibility in terms of shape, color distribution, and texture.",
      "question": "Does the transformed hairstyle retain a consistent volumetric structure without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in the cotton candy swirls?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the clothing into a stylized 3D paper doll outfit with a sleek, glossy finish and bold geometric patterns, the suit’s material and surface properties are being altered from fabric to a synthetic, reflective, cartoon-like appearance. The original suit appears as a standard dark woolen jacket with subtle texture. The editing must avoid introducing artificial reflections, mismatched lighting, or distorted folds that contradict physical realism. The evaluation checks whether the material transition preserves structural integrity and avoids artifacts like unnatural shine or flattened geometry.",
      "question": "Is the suit’s surface uniformly glossy without areas of over-saturation or unnatural reflection that disrupt the 3D paper doll illusion?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adjusting the tie to be a vibrant, oversized cartoon-style element with bright, contrasting colors, the tie is being modified in both size and color scheme. In the original image, the tie is proportionally sized and features a subtle pattern. The edit introduces a larger-than-life design that may distort facial proportions or create spatial inconsistencies. The evaluation focuses on whether the tie’s exaggerated size respects the head-to-body ratio and whether its edges are cleanly defined without blurring or warping.",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using pastel pink and blue hues for the cotton candy hair, the color palette must remain visually cohesive and avoid abrupt transitions or clashing tones. The original hair is monochromatic white; introducing two distinct pastel colors requires smooth blending to preserve the illusion of softness. If color boundaries are sharp or pixelated, it would indicate poor rendering quality. The evaluation checks for seamless integration of the new color scheme within the hair’s structure.",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying bold geometric patterns to the stylized suit, the design must integrate seamlessly with the existing garment shape. The original suit has clean lines and structured shoulders. Introducing geometric patterns could lead to misalignment with contours or cause distortion in areas like the lapel or shoulder seam. The evaluation ensures that the patterns follow the suit’s natural silhouette and do not introduce floating shapes or broken lines.",
