      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the fur texture with a polished bronze surface across the entire body, this question evaluates whether the transformation maintains anatomical accuracy and avoids unnatural distortions in facial features such as the nose, mouth, and whiskers. The original image has clear facial details, so any metalization should preserve these structures without flattening or warping them.",
      "question": "Are the facial features such as the nose, mouth, and whiskers preserved in shape and position after conversion to bronze, without visible distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the knitted hat with a bronze helmet, this question checks whether the new helmet maintains the same scale and placement as the original hat, and whether its shape is structurally coherent and free from geometric errors such as sharp edges or misaligned seams.",
      "question": "Is the bronze helmet properly scaled and positioned on the head, with smooth transitions at the edges and no visible gaps or misalignments with the skull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the sunglasses into bronze-framed glass lenses, this question assesses whether the new glasses maintain proper alignment with the eye sockets and whether the lens material appears consistent with glass (e.g., reflective, transparent) and the frame with bronze (e.g., metallic sheen, thickness).",
      "question": "Do the bronze-framed glasses sit correctly over the eyes without shifting or overlapping incorrectly, and do the lenses show realistic glass-like reflection and transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the sweater into a bronze garment with engraved lines, this question evaluates whether the sweater retains its original shape and fit on the body, and whether the engraved patterns appear continuous and plausible on a metallic surface without breaking or distorting the fabric-like structure.",
      "question": "Does the bronze sweater maintain the original shape and shoulder strap placement, with engraved lines that follow the contours of the garment without breaking or appearing artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a marble base beneath the sculpture, this question checks whether the base is proportionally sized and properly grounded under the figure, ensuring it supports the sculpture without appearing disconnected or floating.",
      "question": "Is the marble base positioned directly beneath the sculpture, with appropriate contact points and no visible gap between the feet and the base, and is it proportionally sized to support the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
