      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the dancing woman into an Art Nouveau-inspired stained glass style while retaining her dynamic pose and colorful garments, evaluate whether the geometric patterns and flowing lines applied to her body maintain structural coherence and avoid unnatural distortions. Specifically, check if the limbs, especially the raised leg and arms, retain anatomical proportions and natural curvature without broken or warped shapes.",
      "question": "Does the dancer’s raised leg and arm maintain natural human proportions and joint alignment despite the stylized design, with no visible geometric distortion or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of stylizing the dancer’s garments with intricate geometric patterns resembling stained glass, assess whether the textures and color transitions in her clothing follow consistent, seamless patterns typical of stained glass art, avoiding pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent shading that would suggest artifacts.",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the dancer’s dress and accessories composed of smooth, continuous lines and uniform color segments without jagged edges or fragmented areas indicating texture errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reimagining the rural African village as a dreamlike landscape with curvilinear trees and huts using a muted iridescent glass palette, evaluate whether the background elements such as huts and trees have been transformed into flowing, organic shapes without losing their structural integrity or appearing unnaturally flattened or stretched.",
      "question": "Do the huts and trees in the background exhibit smooth, curved forms consistent with Art Nouveau aesthetics, without distorted silhouettes or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying a muted, iridescent glass-like color palette to the entire scene, assess whether the colors across all elements—including the sky, ground, and figures—transition smoothly and harmoniously without abrupt shifts or unnatural glows that could indicate overprocessing or artifacting.",
      "question": "Is the color gradient across the sky and ground consistent with a soft, iridescent glass effect, showing no harsh boundaries or artificial highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving the dancer's dynamic pose and ensuring visual credibility in motion, evaluate whether the positioning of her hands, particularly the one holding the cloth, maintains ergonomic plausibility—such as correct finger count, natural hand shape, and realistic interaction with the fabric—without deformation or floating elements.",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the cloth display five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and does it interact realistically with the fabric without clipping or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
