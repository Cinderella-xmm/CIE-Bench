      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"stylizing the cake with bold, graphic icing patterns\", evaluate whether the texture and pattern applied to the cake surface maintain visual coherence and avoid unnatural artifacts. The original cake has a textured pink frosting with small beads; the edited version should preserve structural consistency while introducing stylized elements without distorting geometry or introducing pixelation or jagged edges.",
      "question": "Does the cake’s icing display bold, graphic patterns that are evenly distributed and free from distorted textures or broken lines?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"rendering the balloons in vivid monochrome dots\", assess whether the transformation of the colorful balloons into dot-based patterns preserves their spherical shape and spatial positioning. The original balloons float above the table in a natural cluster; the edited version must retain this arrangement without warping shapes or creating floating disconnected dots.",
      "question": "Are the balloons represented as uniform monochrome dots that maintain their original spherical form and clustered grouping without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"converting the table and vase into contrasting color blocks\", evaluate whether the wooden table and ceramic vase have been transformed into solid, flat-colored regions without losing their basic shapes or introducing unnatural edges. The original table has visible wood grain and the vase has subtle glaze texture; these should be replaced with clean color blocks without bleeding or inconsistent borders.",
      "question": "Have the table and vase been converted into solid, contrasting color blocks with sharp, clean edges and no residual textures or blending artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"emphasizing the candle flame with exaggerated sharp lines and bright hues\", assess whether the flame's appearance is enhanced with stylized lines and vibrant colors while maintaining a plausible upward direction and glow. The original flame is a soft yellow-orange; the edited version may use sharper outlines but must not appear detached or physically implausible.",
      "question": "Does the candle flame feature exaggerated sharp lines and bright hues while remaining attached to the wick and showing an upward directional flow without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of \"maintaining overall structural coherence and visual plausibility\", evaluate whether the composition of all edited elements—cake, balloons, table, vase, and candle—remains logically arranged in space. The original scene has depth and perspective; the pop art style must not disrupt spatial relationships (e.g., objects appearing behind others incorrectly or floating without support).",
      "question": "Are all edited elements positioned consistently within the scene’s depth and perspective, with no floating or misplaced components relative to the table and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
