Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the kimono's floral pattern and delicate fabric into a vibrant anime-style illustration, evaluate whether the texture and material of the kimono have been transformed in a way that maintains visual coherence and avoids unnatural artifacts. The original image shows a realistic silk-like fabric with subtle floral patterns; the editing should preserve structural integrity while stylizing it. The question focuses on whether the new style introduces distorted textures or inconsistent material properties.
Question: Does the kimono’s fabric display consistent, sharp anime-style lines and vibrant colors without visible pixelation, blurring, or unnatural texture repetition?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of elevating cherry blossoms into oversized, colorful props with exaggerated petals, assess whether the size and proportion of the flowers relative to the head and face remain visually plausible. The original image features natural-sized blossoms integrated into the hair; enlarging them must not cause geometric distortion or spatial inconsistency.
Question: Are the cherry blossoms proportionally enlarged but still positioned in a way that maintains spatial logic and does not overlap or distort facial features unnaturally?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of rendering branch shapes as sharply defined ink lines, evaluate whether the branches maintain clear, continuous line work typical of anime art without breaking or appearing fragmented. The original image has soft, natural-looking branches; the edited version should retain their structure while stylizing them.
Question: Do the cherry blossom branches appear as clean, unbroken ink lines with no jagged edges, missing segments, or unnatural breaks?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of accentuating rich color contrasts throughout, assess whether the color palette remains harmonious and coherent across the entire image. The original image has muted, natural tones; the edit introduces vibrant colors, so the transition must avoid clashing hues or abrupt tonal shifts that break realism.
Question: Are the colors in the kimono, blossoms, and background balanced such that there are no jarring transitions or areas where colors appear artificially saturated or disconnected from surrounding elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility when transforming elements, evaluate whether the mask and hair remain structurally intact despite the stylistic changes. The mask is a key element; its shape and integration with the face must not be distorted during the transformation.
Question: Is the mask’s shape preserved with smooth contours and proper alignment to the face, without warping, stretching, or misalignment due to the anime-style conversion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
