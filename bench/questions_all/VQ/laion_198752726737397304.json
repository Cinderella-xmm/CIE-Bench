      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming clothing into floral-themed superhero costumes, this question evaluates whether the material properties (such as texture, sheen, and pattern) of the new outfits appear natural and physically plausible when compared to real fabrics. It also checks for distortions in garment shape or fit that could suggest digital manipulation artifacts.",
      "question": "Do the superhero costumes on all five individuals have consistent fabric textures and realistic draping that follow the contours of their bodies without unnatural stretching or folding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding \"Daffodil Power Pass\" props held in hands, this question assesses whether the interaction between the hand and the object is anatomically accurate and visually coherent. Specifically, it checks for proper finger count, grip alignment, and integration of the prop into the scene without floating or misalignment.",
      "question": "Are the hands holding the Daffodil Power Passes positioned naturally with five fingers visible per hand, appropriate grip pressure, and no signs of clipping or floating objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of introducing dynamic poses, this question examines whether the body postures of the individuals maintain physical realism—such as correct limb angles, balanced weight distribution, and absence of exaggerated or impossible joint positions—that would otherwise suggest distortion or deformation.",
      "question": "Are the poses of the five individuals physically plausible, with joints aligned naturally and no bent limbs or disproportionate body segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding dialogue bubbles, this question checks whether the placement and design of the speech bubbles respect visual depth, avoid obscuring key facial features, and use clear, readable text without pixelation or blurring that might indicate low-resolution rendering.",
      "question": "Are the dialogue bubbles positioned above or near the heads of the individuals without overlapping eyes or mouths, and do they display legible text with clean edges and no visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enhancing the garden setting, this question evaluates whether the added vegetation and lighting effects are consistent with natural outdoor environments—specifically checking for realistic shadow direction, color harmony, and spatial coherence between foreground and background elements.",
      "question": "Is the enhanced garden background visually coherent with the original scene, featuring consistent lighting, natural flower arrangements, and no abrupt color shifts or artificial-looking textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
