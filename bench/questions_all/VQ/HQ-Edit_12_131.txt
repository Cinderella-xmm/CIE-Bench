Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining bold moko patterns on the warrior’s face and body, evaluate whether the tattoo design remains structurally coherent and visually consistent with the original image. The editing involves retaining intricate patterns across facial features, chest, arms, and back—critical areas where distortion or texture degradation could compromise authenticity. The question focuses on whether the pattern continuity is preserved without unnatural breaks or blurring, especially around facial contours and muscle definition.
Question: Are the moko tattoos on the warrior’s face, chest, arms, and back continuous and free from broken lines or pixelated textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving the flax piupiu skirt and leg wraps, assess whether the material texture of the skirt and leg coverings appears natural and consistent with real flax fibers. The original image shows layered, fibrous textures that must be retained in the edited version. Any smoothing, stretching, or artificial uniformity would degrade perceived authenticity.
Question: Do the flax fibers of the piupiu skirt and leg wraps maintain natural variation in length, thickness, and shading without appearing overly smooth or synthetic?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of keeping the wide haka stance, evaluate whether the warrior’s pose retains anatomical correctness and physical plausibility. The stance involves bent knees, splayed legs, and outstretched arms—positions that must not exhibit joint distortion, unnatural limb angles, or disproportionate musculature. This ensures structural consistency and visual credibility.
Question: Are the warrior’s limbs positioned naturally with correct joint alignment and muscle tension, avoiding exaggerated or impossible bends?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a carved-wood title banner at the top of the card, evaluate whether the banner integrates seamlessly into the composition. It must appear as a physically plausible object with realistic wood grain, depth, and lighting consistent with the scene. Artifacts such as floating edges, mismatched shadows, or inconsistent texture would reduce authenticity.
Question: Does the carved-wood title banner have realistic wood texture, proper shadowing, and edge integration with the background without appearing to float or clip unnaturally?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing stat bars ([Courage +10], [Mana +9], etc.) below the warrior, evaluate whether these elements are rendered with clean typography and spatial logic. The stat bars must be legible, proportionally sized, and aligned with the card layout without overlapping or distorting surrounding elements. Their placement should not interfere with the natural flow of the image.
Question: Are the stat bars clearly visible, evenly spaced, and positioned without overlapping or distorting the warrior’s figure or background elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of framing the card with polished metallic edges, assess whether the frame has consistent reflective properties, thickness, and curvature that match a realistic metal material. The edges must follow the card’s perimeter without jagged lines, transparency issues, or mismatched lighting.
Question: Do the metallic frame edges have uniform thickness, smooth curves, and realistic reflections that align with the lighting direction in the scene?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q7: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing a nameplate below the warrior, evaluate whether the nameplate is properly scaled, centered, and integrated into the layout. It must not appear misaligned, too large/small, or disconnected from the rest of the card design. Its material (e.g., stone, wood) should also be consistent with the overall aesthetic.
Question: Is the nameplate positioned centrally beneath the warrior, with appropriate size and material texture that matches the stylistic theme without visual dissonance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
