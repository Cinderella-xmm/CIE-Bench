Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the lady's traditional qipao into a fashion-themed art postcard with specific stylistic changes. This involves modifying the texture, color scheme, and decorative elements of the robe, including adding silk-like watercolor texture in pastel hues, floral patterns with gold foil accents, a matching floral border, and a writing space framed by delicate branches on textured ivory paper. These modifications are applied to the entire garment area (from collar to hem), surrounding borders, and background layout. The original image shows a light blue floral qipao with realistic fabric folds and natural skin tones. The editing process must preserve structural coherence of the clothing, avoid distortion in fabric flow or body alignment, maintain plausible proportions between the figure and added elements, and ensure that new textures and materials do not introduce unnatural artifacts such as jagged edges, inconsistent lighting, or misaligned patterns.

-Sub requirement 1: Modify the texture and material of the qipao to resemble silk-like watercolor texture in pastel hues—evaluate whether this change maintains visual plausibility and natural appearance without introducing artificial-looking textures or color bleeding.
-Sub requirement 2: Enhance floral patterns with gold foil accents—assess if these additions appear physically consistent with the fabric surface and lighting conditions, avoiding unnatural highlights or floating elements.
-Sub requirement 3: Add a matching floral border around the image—check whether the border aligns seamlessly with the subject’s edge and does not disrupt spatial depth or perspective.
-Sub requirement 4: Insert a writing space framed by delicate branches—determine if the frame is proportionally balanced, structurally coherent, and visually integrated without distorting the surrounding areas.
-Sub requirement 5: Present the final composition on textured ivory paper—evaluate whether the background texture overlays naturally without affecting the clarity or sharpness of the foreground elements.
-Sub requirement 6: Preserve the anatomical accuracy and natural appearance of the elderly woman’s hands and facial features—ensure no deformation occurs during editing, especially when integrating new layers or textures near limbs.
-Sub requirement 7: Maintain geometric consistency and physical rationality of all added elements—verify that no part of the design appears stretched, clipped, or misaligned due to digital manipulation.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of modifying the qipao’s texture to a silk-like watercolor finish in pastel hues, evaluate whether the new texture appears smooth and continuous across the fabric, particularly in areas like the sleeves and chest where folds occur. Check for any visible pixelation, unnatural sheen, or abrupt transitions between colors that could indicate artifacting or poor blending.
Question: Does the fabric of the qipao display a uniform silk-like watercolor texture without visible seams, blocky patches, or inconsistent shading?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of adding gold foil accents to the floral patterns, assess whether the metallic highlights follow the curvature of the flowers and leaves and reflect light consistently with the ambient lighting in the scene. Look for floating highlights, incorrect specular reflections, or misplaced glints that suggest artificial overlay.
Question: Are the gold foil accents on the floral patterns aligned with the flower shapes and do they show realistic reflection behavior based on the surrounding lighting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a floral border, determine if the border extends evenly along the edges of the image and integrates smoothly with the background and subject. Check for clipping artifacts, misalignment at corners, or overlapping that breaks the illusion of a unified frame.
Question: Is the floral border continuous and properly aligned along all four edges of the image without gaps, overlaps, or distorted elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of inserting a writing space framed by delicate branches, verify that the branch framing is symmetrically positioned, proportionally sized relative to the subject, and does not intersect or obscure key facial or clothing details. Also check if the branches have natural curvature and texture.
Question: Are the branches forming the writing space correctly shaped, evenly spaced, and free from unnatural bends or disconnected segments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of presenting the image on textured ivory paper, evaluate whether the paper texture is uniformly applied across the background without altering the sharpness or contrast of the central figure. Ensure the texture does not create moiré patterns or shadow distortions over the subject.
Question: Is the ivory paper texture visible in the background but does not interfere with the clarity or detail of the person or clothing?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of preserving anatomical accuracy, especially in the hands, examine the number of fingers, their positioning, skin wrinkles, and joint structure. Confirm that there are exactly five fingers per hand, no extra digits, and that the hand posture is ergonomically plausible given the pose.
Question: Do both hands show five fingers each with natural joint angles and skin texture, and are they positioned in a way that matches human anatomy?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
