      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving structural coherence when adding cartoon features to the whoopie pies, this question evaluates whether the facial features (eyes, mouth) are seamlessly integrated into the cookie surface without disrupting the original shape or creating unnatural bulges or gaps.",
      "question": "Are the eyes and mouth drawn on the whoopie pie surfaces aligned with the curvature of the cookie and free from visible distortions or floating elements?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining natural material appearance during stylization, this question checks whether the chocolate texture of the cookie is preserved in a recognizable way despite the addition of bold outlines and flat colors.",
      "question": "Does the chocolate cookie surface retain its original texture pattern (such as cracks and dimples) beneath the cartoon-style coloring, or is it completely smoothed out in an unnatural way?",

        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of avoiding distortion in newly added elements, this question assesses whether the limbs (arms, legs) attached to the whoopie pies are proportionally consistent with the body and do not extend beyond the physical boundaries of the cookie in a way that breaks geometric logic.",
      "question": "Are the limbs of the whoopie pie characters proportionally scaled to the cookie body and connected at logical points (e.g., sides or top), without appearing detached or misaligned?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of physical plausibility for introduced objects, this question evaluates whether the spatula used as a sword is appropriately sized and positioned relative to the character, maintaining realistic proportions and interaction.",
      "question": "Is the spatula held by the leading whoopie pie character proportionally sized compared to the cookie body and oriented in a way that suggests natural grip and movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining visual credibility in composition, this question checks whether the placement of the whoopie pie characters on the plate and their positioning relative to each other follows spatial logic and does not result in overlapping or clipping that contradicts depth perception.",
      "question": "Are the two whoopie pie characters peering over the edge of the plate positioned so that their lower halves remain below the plate’s edge, with no unnatural floating or cut-off limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of legible and properly placed text, this question evaluates whether the dialogue bubble is clearly readable, positioned near the correct character, and does not interfere with the character's form or background elements.",
      "question": "Is the text bubble containing “I heard today’s flavor is mint! Let’s find it!” placed adjacent to the speaking character without overlapping critical features like eyes or limbs, and is the handwritten font clear and unblurred?",
