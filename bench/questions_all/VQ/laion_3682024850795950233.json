      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the top and bottom bread slices to resemble armored plating, this involves altering the surface texture and shape of the bread. The question evaluates whether the bread's grain pattern and crust remain visually consistent with real wheat bread, avoiding unnatural smoothing, warping, or artificial shading that would suggest digital over-editing.",
      "question": "Does the bread slice retain a natural crumb texture and crust edge without visible smoothing or unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding anthropomorphic features such as eyes and arms, this introduces new elements that must be integrated into the sandwich’s structure. The question checks whether the added facial features (eyes, mouth) are proportionally scaled relative to the bread slice and whether they maintain a natural appearance without floating or misalignment.",
      "question": "Are the facial features positioned within the bread slice and aligned with its surface plane, without appearing detached or floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the lettuce into a cape, this involves repositioning and reshaping the lettuce leaves. The question assesses whether the lettuce retains its natural green color variation, vein structure, and curling edges, even when extended beyond the sandwich’s base.",
      "question": "Do the lettuce leaves forming the cape show consistent leaf texture and natural curling, without flat or uniformly colored sections suggesting loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a timeline with hand-drawn illustrations at the bottom, this involves introducing new graphical elements outside the sandwich. The question evaluates whether the illustrations are cleanly rendered, with smooth lines and no jagged edges or pixelation, and whether they are properly spaced and aligned with the rest of the composition.",
      "question": "Are the hand-drawn illustrations in the timeline clearly defined with uniform stroke thickness and no visible pixelation or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating circular action icons, this involves adding geometric shapes that must be perfectly round and evenly colored. The question checks for any imperfections in the circle’s outline, such as angular corners or uneven fill, which would indicate rendering artifacts.",
      "question": "Are all circular icons perfectly round with smooth edges and consistent fill color, without any jaggedness or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
