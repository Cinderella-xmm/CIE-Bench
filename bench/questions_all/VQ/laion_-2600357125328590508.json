      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the sock into a sculptural piece made of LEGO bricks while retaining original patterns using blocky bricks, evaluate whether the structural transformation maintains geometric coherence and visual plausibility. The original sock has distinct sections (cuff, leg, foot) with defined patterns and textures; converting these into LEGO-like blocks must preserve the overall shape and proportion without distorting key features like the heel, toe, or cuff. The question focuses on whether the transition from textile to brick form introduces unnatural distortions in shape or scale.",
      "question": "Are the LEGO brick structures aligned with the original sock’s contours, maintaining consistent proportions and avoiding warped or stretched geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding depth with layered construction for a 3D effect, assess whether the layering of LEGO bricks creates a believable sense of depth and volume without introducing floating or disconnected elements. The original sock has a smooth, continuous surface; the edited version should simulate physical depth through stacked bricks that logically follow the curvature of the sock, especially around the ankle and toe areas.",
      "question": "Do the layered LEGO bricks follow the natural curves of the sock, forming a cohesive 3D structure without gaps or misaligned layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of retaining the original black, gray, and white patterns using blocky bricks, evaluate whether the color distribution accurately reflects the original design. The original sock features specific placements of white text (\"UNO\"), gray accents, and black background—these must be preserved in a pixelated or blocky style without color bleeding or mismatched brick colors.",
      "question": "Are the black, gray, and white LEGO bricks arranged to match the original sock's pattern layout, including the \"UNO\" text and accent stripes, without color inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating an orange LEGO piece for the tag, evaluate whether the tag is realistically replaced with a LEGO element that matches the material and style of the rest of the sculpture. The original tag is small and located at the top of the cuff; it must be transformed into a single orange LEGO brick or piece that integrates seamlessly without appearing out of place or physically impossible.",
      "question": "Is the orange LEGO piece positioned at the top of the cuff and integrated into the brick structure without floating or unnatural attachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of displaying the sculpture upright in a minimalist gallery setting to emphasize architectural detail, evaluate whether the background and lighting support the intended presentation. The original image has a neutral background; the edited version should maintain clean, even lighting and minimal shadows to highlight the 3D structure without distracting elements or unrealistic reflections.",
      "question": "Is the sculpture presented upright against a clean, uniform background with even lighting that highlights its 3D form without casting unnatural shadows or reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
