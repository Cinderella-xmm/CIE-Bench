      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the black bottle cap with an elegant glass stopper, evaluate whether the new stopper maintains structural coherence and material realism. The original cap is cylindrical and matte black plastic, so the replacement must conform to physical plausibility—its shape should be proportionally consistent with the neck of the bottle, and the glass material should reflect light naturally without unnatural transparency or distortion.",
      "question": "Does the glass stopper on the bottle have a smooth, reflective surface consistent with real glass, and does it fit proportionally with the bottle's neck without appearing oversized or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding thin, dark diffuser reeds protruding from the top of the bottle, assess whether these elements are physically plausible and visually coherent. The reeds should emerge vertically from the stopper in a natural arrangement, with consistent thickness and spacing, and should not appear distorted or clipped unnaturally against the background.",
      "question": "Are the diffuser reeds straight, evenly spaced, and properly aligned with the stopper, showing no signs of jagged edges, unnatural bending, or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the label to feature an art deco design with emerald green and gold color scheme, evaluate whether the new label maintains visual consistency with the bottle’s shape and proportions. The label must cover the same area as the original, preserve legibility, and integrate seamlessly with the bottle’s curvature without warping or stretching.",
      "question": "Is the art deco label properly aligned on the front of the bottle, maintaining its rectangular shape and correct proportions without visible warping or texture distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of introducing floral and botanical illustrations on the label, evaluate whether these elements are rendered with natural detail and appropriate scale. The illustrations should not appear pixelated, overly sharp, or mismatched in style with the art deco theme, and should be clearly integrated into the design without overlapping text or breaking layout rules.",
      "question": "Do the floral and botanical illustrations on the label have clear outlines, natural shading, and consistent scale relative to the surrounding text and design elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using a rich emerald green and gold color scheme for branding, evaluate whether the colors are applied uniformly and harmoniously across the label and any newly added elements (e.g., logo, text). The color transition should be smooth, and there should be no color bleeding, banding, or inconsistent saturation that breaks visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are the emerald green and gold colors on the label applied smoothly without visible color fringing, banding, or abrupt transitions between hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
