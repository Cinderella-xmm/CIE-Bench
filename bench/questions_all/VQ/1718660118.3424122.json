      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the military uniform with a Victorian steampunk outfit featuring brass and copper elements, this question evaluates whether the new materials (such as brass gears and copper piping) exhibit natural metallic textures and reflections consistent with real-world physics, avoiding flat or overly shiny surfaces that suggest digital artifacting.",
      "question": "Do the brass and copper elements on the uniform show natural surface variations, such as subtle scratches, patina, and reflective highlights, without appearing uniformly smooth or unnaturally glossy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating mechanical gears into the uniform, this question checks whether the geometric shapes of the gears are correctly proportioned and aligned with the fabric layers, ensuring they do not float above the surface or intersect improperly with the body or clothing folds.",
      "question": "Are the gear components on the uniform properly embedded within the fabric structure, maintaining consistent depth and avoiding overlapping or misaligned teeth that break geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the original chair with a mechanical throne, this question assesses whether the throne’s mechanical components (cogwheels, joints, supports) are structurally plausible and anchored to the floor, with no floating or disconnected parts that violate physical logic.",
      "question": "Does the mechanical throne have visible support structures and grounding that prevent it from appearing suspended or unstable, with all cogwheels and braces attached logically to the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of altering the color scheme to copper, brown, and dark green, this question examines whether the new colors are applied consistently across materials (fabric, metal, skin), preserving shading and contrast without introducing unnatural color bleeding or mismatched tones.",
      "question": "Are the copper, brown, and dark green hues distributed evenly across the uniform, throne, and background, with transitions between colors following natural lighting gradients and avoiding abrupt or patchy changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding steam trails in the background, this question evaluates whether the smoke appears translucent with soft edges and directional flow, mimicking real atmospheric diffusion rather than being blocky or digitally rendered.",
      "question": "Do the steam trails in the background have gradual opacity and wispy edges, flowing naturally from potential sources like vents or machinery, without sharp outlines or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving hand anatomy, this question checks whether both hands retain five fingers with correct joint angles, natural skin texture, and no deformation or extra digits, especially where they rest on the mechanical throne’s arms.",
      "question": "Do both hands display five fingers with proper spacing and curvature, and are the knuckles and fingernails rendered with natural detail, without any fused, missing, or duplicated digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
