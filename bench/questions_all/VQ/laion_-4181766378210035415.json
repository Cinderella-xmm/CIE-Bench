      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the entire bed structure with interlocking LEGO bricks, this question evaluates whether the transformed bed maintains structural coherence and avoids broken or misaligned brick geometry. The original bed has clean lines and rectangular forms, so the LEGO version should replicate these shapes with proper alignment and interlocking logic. Any visible gaps, floating bricks, or incorrect angles would indicate distortion.",
      "question": "Are all LEGO bricks forming the bed frame, mattress, and base properly aligned and interlocked without visible gaps or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replicating the light blue floral pattern on the bedding using LEGO bricks, this question checks whether the pattern is preserved in a way that matches the original design. Since LEGO bricks are modular, the pattern must be approximated using colored bricks without losing key features like leaf shapes or spacing. Unnatural blockiness or missing details would reduce perceptual quality.",
      "question": "Does the light blue floral pattern on the duvet appear consistent with the original design, with no missing or incorrectly placed colored bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the headboard with smooth, curved LEGO pieces, this question evaluates whether the curvature is physically plausible for LEGO construction. LEGO typically uses angular or semi-circular pieces, so any exaggerated curves must still appear as valid LEGO elements. Excessive smoothing or unnatural bends would suggest artifacting.",
      "question": "Is the curved shape of the new headboard composed of LEGO-style elements that follow realistic LEGO curvature without appearing stretched or deformed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of constructing pillows from stacked smaller LEGO bricks, this question checks whether the stacking creates a natural 3D volume. The original pillows are soft and slightly compressed; the LEGO version must simulate this through layered height and slight indentation. Floating or overly rigid stacks would break visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are the pillows formed by stacked LEGO bricks showing a natural three-dimensional shape with appropriate layering and no floating or disconnected pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the same grayscale background and lighting, this question ensures that the edited image does not introduce unwanted shadows, highlights, or color casts. The LEGO bed should cast shadows consistent with the original lighting direction and intensity. Any mismatch would suggest poor integration.",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the LEGO bed match the lighting direction and softness of the original image, with no unnatural dark spots or over-bright areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving proportions and spatial relationships, this question evaluates whether the size and positioning of each component (pillows, duvet, headboard) remain consistent with the original bed. For example, the duvet should still fold neatly at the foot, and pillows should rest properly against the headboard. Distortion in scale or placement would compromise visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are the proportions and positions of the pillows, duvet, and headboard consistent with the original bed, with no noticeable scaling errors or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring uniform surface textures on LEGO elements, this question checks whether the materials appear consistent across all bricks. LEGO surfaces are matte and slightly textured; any glossy, reflective, or pixelated areas would indicate rendering artifacts.",
      "question": "Do all LEGO bricks have a uniform matte finish with no unnatural glossiness, transparency, or pixelation that would suggest low-quality rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
