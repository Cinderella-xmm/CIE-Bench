      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the central body into a robotic face while preserving sharp edges, this question evaluates whether the facial features (such as eyes, mouth, or sensors) are seamlessly integrated into the original angular structure without distorting its geometry or introducing unnatural textures like pixelation or smudging.",
      "question": "Are the facial features on the central body aligned with the original angular design and free from visible texture artifacts or shape distortions?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting rotor blades into arms, this question checks if the transformed arms maintain proportional length and mechanical integrity relative to the drone's body, and whether they appear to rotate naturally without unnatural bends or disconnected joints.",
      "question": "Do the arms formed from rotor blades have consistent proportions and smooth joints that suggest functional rotation without visible warping or breakage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing landing gears with spider-like legs, this question evaluates whether the new legs are attached at the correct positions (ends of arms) and exhibit proper joint structure and material continuity, avoiding floating or misaligned limbs.",
      "question": "Are the spider-like legs connected at the original landing gear locations and do they display coherent joint structures without gaps or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the character mid-flight over a futuristic cityscape with a metallic aura, this question assesses whether the lighting and reflective properties on the drone match the environmental lighting (e.g., ambient glow, specular highlights) and whether the background integration is seamless without abrupt edges or color mismatches.",
      "question": "Is the lighting on the drone consistent with the futuristic cityscape background, showing appropriate metallic reflections and no harsh transitions between the drone and environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a speech bubble with bold tech-style text, this question checks if the text is clearly readable, stylistically matched to the sci-fi theme, and positioned without overlapping critical parts of the drone or causing visual clutter.",
      "question": "Is the speech bubble positioned near the robotic face with clear, legible text and no overlap with drone components or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
