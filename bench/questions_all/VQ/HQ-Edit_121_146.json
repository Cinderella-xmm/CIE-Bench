      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the ornate teapot into a candle holder packaging while retaining intricate floral motifs as embossed gold details around a glass candle chamber, evaluate whether the transition from solid metallic structure to transparent glass with embossed gold patterns maintains structural coherence and material plausibility. The original teapotâ€™s body is red with silver filigree; the editing involves replacing the solid form with a translucent glass chamber that must preserve the same floral design in gold relief. This transformation affects the perceived authenticity of materials and surface continuity.",
      "question": "Does the glass candle chamber maintain consistent transparency and refractive qualities with natural glass, and are the embossed gold floral motifs clearly defined without distortion or unnatural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring a rich camel red hue for the glass chamber, assess whether the color applied to the glass matches the intended tone and integrates naturally with the surrounding metallic elements. The original image features a deep red body; changing it to a camel red glass requires careful rendering to avoid chromatic inconsistencies or artificial color blending.",
      "question": "Is the camel red hue of the glass candle chamber evenly distributed and visually harmonious with the surrounding silver and gold elements, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural saturation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a polished wooden lid that mimics the original teapot handle contours, evaluate whether the new lid conforms to the shape and proportion of the original handle and whether the wood texture appears natural and physically plausible. The original handle has an elegant curved form; replicating this in wood requires accurate geometry and realistic grain patterns.",
      "question": "Does the wooden lid accurately reflect the contour and curvature of the original teapot handle, and does it display natural wood grain and polish without visible artifacts or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating an elegant brand logo on the base for uniqueness, evaluate whether the logo is seamlessly integrated into the base without disrupting the existing ornamental pattern or introducing visual anomalies. The base of the original teapot has detailed metalwork; placing a logo there must not break the continuity of the design or appear digitally pasted.",
      "question": "Is the brand logo positioned on the base in a way that aligns with the existing decorative elements, and does it lack jagged edges, misalignment, or unnatural contrast that would suggest digital insertion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the background with a luxuriously patterned fabric, assess whether the new background maintains depth, texture consistency, and lighting harmony with the foreground object. The original background is a warm, gradient-toned wall; replacing it with fabric must preserve ambient lighting and avoid mismatched shadows or reflections.",
      "question": "Does the newly added patterned fabric background exhibit consistent texture, proper lighting interaction, and seamless integration with the teapot's shadow and reflection on the surface below, without visible seams or lighting discrepancies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
