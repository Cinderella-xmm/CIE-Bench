      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the white hull with translucent, iridescent crystal structures, this question evaluates whether the new material at the hull area (bottom portion of the ship) exhibits natural translucency and iridescence without visible artifacts like pixelation, unnatural glow, or inconsistent shading. The material should reflect light realistically and show variation in hue and opacity across facets.",
      "question": "Does the hull of the ship display smooth, consistent translucency and iridescent color shifts across its surface without blocky or repeated patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming windows into multifaceted gem-like elements, this question targets the window areas on all three decks of the ship. It checks whether each window has been replaced with a geometrically coherent, multi-faceted shape that resembles a gemstone, with proper lighting and shadow alignment, avoiding flat or untextured surfaces.",
      "question": "Are the windows on the ship's decks replaced with clearly defined, faceted gem-like shapes that reflect light naturally and maintain consistent depth and edge sharpness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reimagining the decks as intricate crystal paths, this question focuses on the deck surfaces (especially the middle and upper levels). It evaluates whether the new crystal path design maintains continuity, avoids gaps or floating fragments, and shows realistic interaction with light and surrounding elements like railings.",
      "question": "Do the deck surfaces appear as continuous, structured crystal pathways with no floating pieces, cracks, or abrupt transitions between crystal and non-crystal areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the superstructure with faceted crystal domes and angular forms, this question examines the top section of the ship, including the bridge, observation deck, and funnel area. It checks for geometric accuracy, proportionality, and absence of distorted angles or broken lines that would suggest poor rendering.",
      "question": "Is the superstructure of the ship transformed into angular, faceted crystal forms with clean edges and correct proportions, without warped or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the background to a minimalist horizon, this question evaluates the distant landscape and sky. It checks whether the islands and horizon line have been simplified without introducing unnatural voids, abrupt cutoffs, or mismatched lighting that contrasts with the crystal ship.",
      "question": "Has the background been adjusted to a minimalistic horizon with softened or removed distant islands, while maintaining a smooth transition between the water and sky without visual breaks or mismatches in brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring overall structural coherence and visual credibility, this question assesses the spatial relationship between the crystal ship and its environment. It checks whether the ship remains properly grounded in the water, with no floating sections or misalignment in perspective.",
      "question": "Is the crystal ship positioned correctly on the water surface with no floating portions or misaligned base, and does it maintain proper scale relative to the surrounding water and horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts such as ghosting, blurring, or texture repetition, this question focuses on the surface details of the crystal elements. It checks for uniformity in texture application, especially in reflective areas, and whether there are any repeating patterns or smudges indicating low-quality rendering.",
      "question": "Are the crystal surfaces free from repetitive textures, blurred edges, or ghosting effects that suggest digital artifacts or poor synthesis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
