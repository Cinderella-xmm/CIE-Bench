Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires enlarging the shopping bags and transforming them into vibrant geometric patterns while preserving their assorted shapes. This involves significant modification to the size, texture, and structure of the bags, which are currently held in both hands of the subject. Since the original bags have distinct colors (white, black, red, brown), and realistic paper textures, the transformation must maintain structural coherence and avoid unnatural distortions or loss of detail during enlargement and stylization. The key concern is whether the enlarged geometric patterns retain visual credibility and do not introduce artifacts such as jagged edges, inconsistent proportions, or broken geometry.
-Sub requirement 1: Enlarge the shopping bags in both hands and convert them into vibrant geometric patterns while maintaining their original shapes—evaluate whether the transformation preserves structural integrity, avoids distortion, and maintains natural appearance without introducing artifacts.

-<Thinking Process 2>: The coat is to be converted into a velvety texture with a darker crimson tone. The original coat is a solid maroon wool-like material with visible stitching and zippers. Changing its texture to velvet involves altering surface reflectivity, softness, and depth perception. The challenge lies in ensuring that the new texture appears consistent across the entire garment, especially at seams and edges, without creating unnatural highlights or shadows that break realism.
-Sub requirement 2: Modify the coat’s material to a velvety texture with a darker crimson tone—assess whether the texture change is uniform, physically plausible, and free from unnatural sheen or shadow inconsistencies.

-<Thinking Process 3>: The gloves are to be changed to a sleek, glossy finish. The original gloves are black leather with matte finish and natural creasing. A glossy finish will increase reflectivity and may alter how light interacts with the surface. The focus should be on whether the glossiness appears consistent with real materials, respects anatomical shape, and does not cause unnatural reflections or warping around finger joints.
-Sub requirement 3: Replace the gloves with a sleek, glossy finish—check if the surface reflects light realistically, maintains hand anatomy, and avoids distorted reflections or texture mismatches.

-<Thinking Process 4>: Abstract retail symbols are to be illustrated around the subject on a smooth, matte card background. The original image has a plain wall background with subtle graffiti-like lines. Adding illustrated elements requires integrating them seamlessly without disrupting spatial logic or introducing floating objects. The layout must respect depth and perspective, and the symbols should not overlap incorrectly with the subject or appear disconnected.
-Sub requirement 4: Surround the subject with abstract retail symbols on a matte card background—evaluate whether these elements are positioned logically, maintain proper scale relative to the subject, and integrate without breaking visual continuity or introducing floating/overlapping artifacts.

-<Thinking Process 5>: An open panel for personal messages is to be added. This implies a physical space within the composition, possibly near the bottom or side, resembling a postcard format. It must not interfere with existing elements and must appear as part of the same plane as the rest of the image. The addition must preserve overall layout balance and avoid abrupt transitions or unnatural borders.
-Sub requirement 5: Add an open panel for personal messages—assess whether the panel is integrated smoothly into the composition, maintains consistent lighting and texture with surrounding areas, and does not disrupt the scene's spatial logic.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of enlarging the shopping bags and converting them into vibrant geometric patterns while maintaining their original shapes, this question evaluates whether the transformation preserves the geometric integrity of each bag. The original bags have defined rectangular and trapezoidal forms; after enlargement and stylization, they must still appear structurally sound without warped corners, misaligned edges, or overlapping layers that suggest digital corruption.
Question: Do the enlarged shopping bags retain their original geometric shapes without distorted edges or broken polygons?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of changing the coat to a velvety texture with a darker crimson tone, this question checks whether the new texture appears consistent across the entire garment. Velvet typically has a soft, slightly raised surface with directional light response. If the texture is applied unevenly or shows artificial flatness or overly sharp highlights, it breaks realism.
Question: Is the velvety texture on the coat uniformly applied without unnatural shine or inconsistent surface details?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of changing the gloves to a sleek, glossy finish, this question assesses whether the reflection and sheen on the gloves follow physical laws of light interaction. The fingers should show smooth curvature with reflections that match the direction of ambient light, and there should be no unnatural stretching or missing contours.
Question: Are the glossy gloves visually consistent in shape and reflection, with no distorted finger joints or misplaced highlights?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding abstract retail symbols around the subject on a matte card background, this question evaluates whether the symbols are placed in a way that respects spatial depth and does not intersect improperly with the subject or other elements. They should appear as part of the environment, not floating independently.
Question: Are the abstract retail symbols positioned around the subject without overlapping or intersecting with her body or shopping bags?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding an open panel for personal messages, this question checks whether the panel is integrated into the composition with consistent lighting, color, and texture. It should appear as a natural extension of the postcard format without sharp edges, mismatched shadows, or conflicting perspectives.
Question: Does the open panel for personal messages blend seamlessly into the background with matching lighting and texture?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
