Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the glass body of the Bacardi Mojito bottle into translucent green LEGO bricks, evaluate whether the material transformation maintains a natural appearance and structural coherence. The original bottle has a smooth, transparent glass surface with subtle reflections and refractions; replacing it with LEGO bricks must preserve the cylindrical shape and proportions while avoiding unnatural textures or blocky distortions that break geometric continuity.
Question: Does the translucent green LEGO brick construction of the bottle’s body maintain a consistent cylindrical form without visible warping or misalignment between bricks?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of reconstructing the label using multicolored LEGO blocks, assess whether the text and logo elements (such as "BACARDÍ", "MOJITO", and the bat emblem) remain legible and proportionally accurate despite being rendered in blocky LEGO style. The original label includes fine details like script font and color gradients; these must be preserved in a stylized but readable manner to ensure visual credibility.
Question: Are all brand text elements (e.g., "BACARDÍ", "MOJITO") and logos clearly identifiable and properly aligned on the LEGO label, without distorted letterforms or missing characters?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of constructing the cap from smooth, circular blue LEGO bricks while maintaining its cylindrical form, evaluate whether the cap retains its original shape and scale relative to the bottle. The original cap is a dark green screw-top with a defined ridge pattern; the LEGO version must mimic this structure without flattening or distorting the curvature.
Question: Is the blue LEGO cap accurately shaped as a cylinder with consistent height and diameter matching the original bottle’s neck, and does it feature a smooth, rounded top without angular breaks?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the LEGO bottle on a minimalist white shelf to highlight its sculptural attributes, evaluate whether the shelf is rendered with clean lines and proper perspective, ensuring spatial plausibility. The shelf should not introduce shadows or depth inconsistencies that contradict lighting or geometry of the bottle.
Question: Is the white shelf beneath the LEGO bottle flat, horizontally aligned, and free from irregular edges or floating segments that suggest poor integration with the scene?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of reimagining all brand details with blocky text while preserving legibility, assess whether the fine print below the label (e.g., "natural mint flavor, lime juice, cane sugar") remains readable and proportionally scaled. These small texts must not be obscured by LEGO brick patterns or appear fragmented due to pixelation or misalignment.
Question: Are the smaller text elements such as "natural mint flavor" and "Simply pour over ice" fully visible and correctly spaced on the LEGO label, without overlapping or broken lettering?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
