      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the wall clock and wooden cabinet with a castle hall while maintaining the original lighting style, it's necessary to examine if the transition between the existing room elements and the new castle hall elements maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility.",
      "question": "Does the integration of the castle hall elements into the room visually align with the existing lighting and shadows, avoiding unnatural artifacts?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Given the task to replace the current elements with those of a castle hall, ensuring that materials used in the castle hall replicate the natural and realistic look like stone, metal, or wood is crucial for authenticity.",
      "question": "Are the materials of the newly added castle hall elements, like stone and metal, depicted naturally and free from obvious artifacts?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The existing image contains objects such as books, vases, and plants that should not be affected by the addition of the castle hall. These elements should retain their original form and integrity.",
      "question": "Have the books, vases, and plants remained undistorted and preserved their original details post-editing?",

      "thinking_process": "The overall spatial arrangement in the image should remain logical after integrating the castle hall into the room. The new structures introduced should complement rather than disrupt the existing layout of the room.",
      "question": "Does the introduction of the castle hall maintain the room's spatial rationality, keeping the proportions and placements of objects consistent with expectations?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies preserving the original lighting style. This means that the light sources, shadows, and highlights should appear as though they originate from the same source as in the original image.",
      "question": "Do the lighting effects in the edited castle hall scene match the light source and style of the original room, ensuring continuity in illumination?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
