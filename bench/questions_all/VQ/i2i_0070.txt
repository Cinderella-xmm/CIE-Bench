Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "whether the addition of an African savanna background at night affects the overall realism and natural appearance," we need to assess if the edited background maintains a natural appearance consistent with the train and its tracks in the foreground.
Question: Does the African savanna at night blend seamlessly with the existing train and tracks, without any unnatural edges or contrasts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement to "reflect the overall sense of reality and natural appearance," we need to check whether the Milky Way and starry sky introduced into the image appear realistic and coherent with the rest of the scene.
Question: Are the stars and the Milky Way depicted naturally, without any artificial or pixelated textures disrupting their appearance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: To fulfill the sub requirement concerning "structural consistency and visual credibility," particularly regarding the train and tracks in relation to the new background, we must confirm if the lighting and shadows match the new setting.
Question: Do the lighting and shadows on the train and tracks correspond logically to the new nighttime savanna setting, maintaining structural coherence?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Addressing the sub requirement that "the proportion and physical rationality of each element avoid distortion," specifically focusing on the train and the newly added background, it is essential to ensure that the proportions remain plausible.
Question: Is the size of the train relative to the vastness of the African savanna and the starry sky proportionally correct and believable?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement to "avoid introducing artifacts such as unnatural textures and loss of details," especially for the train, which is the primary subject, we need to evaluate if its details remain intact.
Question: Have the fine details of the train been preserved without degradation or introduction of unnatural textures during the editing process?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
