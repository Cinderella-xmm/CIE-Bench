Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the ornate silver teapot body into a sleek cylindrical tea canister while maintaining the dragon engravings, evaluate whether the shape transition from the original rounded teapot body to a cylindrical form preserves structural coherence and visual plausibility. The editing position is the main body of the teapot, which must retain the metallic texture and engraved dragons but now in a cylinder. This change affects geometric integrity and material continuity.
Question: Is the cylindrical body of the tea canister proportionally consistent with the original teapot’s scale and maintains continuous, undistorted dragon engravings along its surface?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the original lid with a streamlined metallic screw cap embossed with intricate tea leaves, assess whether the new cap integrates naturally with the rest of the object in terms of material, finish, and geometric alignment. The lid’s replacement involves altering the top structure, which must match the silver tone and reflectivity of the original teapot.
Question: Does the screw cap appear seamlessly integrated with the canister body, with no visible seams or mismatched textures, and does it exhibit consistent metallic sheen and fine leaf embossing?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of inscribing the brand name "Dragon's Delight" along the spout, evaluate whether the text placement follows natural curvature and proportions of the spout without distorting the existing design or introducing unnatural lettering. The spout is a curved, elongated element where text must conform to the surface.
Question: Is the text "Dragon's Delight" aligned smoothly along the spout’s curve, with legible, evenly spaced characters that do not distort the underlying metal texture or cause unnatural shading?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a minimalist tea leaf logo on the top of the screw cap, assess whether the logo is proportionally small and stylistically consistent with the overall design, avoiding any visual imbalance or texture mismatch. The logo must be subtle and integrated into the cap’s surface without appearing pasted or pixelated.
Question: Is the tea leaf logo centered on the cap’s top, rendered with clean lines and uniform depth, and free from jagged edges or inconsistent lighting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving the dragon engravings while converting the body shape, evaluate whether the engraving details remain sharp, continuous, and anatomically coherent across the cylindrical surface. The dragons must maintain their original level of intricacy without stretching or breaking due to the shape transformation.
Question: Are the dragon engravings fully intact and evenly distributed across the cylindrical body, with no gaps, repetition, or warping that would suggest deformation during the shape conversion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
