      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the clay texture with a marbled ceramic finish, evaluate whether the new surface texture appears uniform and physically plausible across both vases. The marbling should follow natural stone-like flow patterns without breaking the shape or introducing pixelation or unevenness.",
      "question": "Does the marbled ceramic finish on both vases display consistent, smooth patterns without visible texture breaks or artificial repetitions?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding branding decals, assess whether any logos or text are present on the vases in a way that respects the curvature and does not cause warping or stretching. The decals should be small and integrated seamlessly into the design.",
      "question": "Are the branding decals applied to the vases clearly visible, proportionally sized, and aligned with the surface curvature without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding gold leaf accents, check whether the gold elements are placed along petal edges or base contours in a way that follows light direction and material reflection rules. They should not appear flat or disconnected from the underlying surface.",
      "question": "Do the gold leaf accents on the vases show realistic highlights and edge definition consistent with metallic foil applied to curved surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of designing a packaging box with a cross-sectional view of the vase interior, verify that the illustration inside the box matches the actual internal structure of the vases, including the artichoke-like pattern. The cross-section must be rendered with correct depth and alignment.",
      "question": "Is the cross-sectional illustration on the packaging box accurately depicting the internal petal arrangement of the vases without geometric mismatch or incorrect layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating bronze typography on a matte black box, assess whether the text is sharp, correctly spaced, and positioned within the frame without clipping or shadow artifacts. The contrast between bronze and black should be clean.",
      "question": "Is the bronze typography on the packaging box legible, evenly spaced, and free from blurring or unwanted shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency, evaluate whether the overall shape and proportions of both vases remain unchanged after editing. Any scaling or deformation would compromise realism.",
      "question": "Are the two vases still symmetrical and proportionally accurate compared to the original, with no stretched or compressed sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
