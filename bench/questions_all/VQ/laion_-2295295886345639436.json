      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the torso and limbs with Ancient Greek mythological armor, this question evaluates whether the armor integrates naturally with the original muscular structure without distorting anatomical proportions. The armor should not overlap incorrectly or cause unnatural bulges or gaps in the body's silhouette, especially around the chest, shoulders, and arms.",
      "question": "Does the Ancient Greek-style armor fit the characterâ€™s torso and limbs without distorting muscle contours or creating unnatural gaps or overlaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding heavy plate armor and a sword in the Feudal Era version, this question checks whether the armor maintains structural coherence at joints (elbows, knees, shoulders) and whether the sword is held in a physically plausible manner without causing limb deformation or floating effects.",
      "question": "Are the joints of the armored limbs articulated properly, and is the sword held in a position that does not bend or stretch the arm beyond natural limits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of depicting the character as an Olympic weightlifter with a barbell across the shoulders, this question evaluates whether the barbell is positioned correctly and symmetrically, and whether the posture reflects realistic weight-bearing mechanics without exaggerated or collapsed spine alignment.",
      "question": "Is the barbell placed evenly across the shoulders with both hands gripping it in a balanced stance, and is the back posture upright and stable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining head consistency across all versions, this question assesses whether the head retains its original shape, size, and facial structure relative to the transformed body, particularly in terms of scale and alignment with the neck and shoulders.",
      "question": "Is the head proportionally aligned with the neck and upper torso in all three versions without appearing oversized, undersized, or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring natural textures and absence of artifacts in added elements, this question focuses on the hands, which are critical interaction points with props. It checks whether the number of fingers is correct, the hand shape is ergonomic, and there are no unnatural deformations or missing details when gripping objects.",
      "question": "Do the hands in all three versions have exactly five fingers, proper joint curvature, and natural grip on the sword or barbell without distortion or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of evaluating overall composition and visual credibility, this question examines whether the lighting, shadows, and spatial relationships between the character and props (armor, sword, barbell) appear coherent and grounded in physical plausibility.",
      "question": "Are the shadows and highlights on the armor, clothing, and props consistent with a single light source and do they enhance the three-dimensional appearance without creating floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
