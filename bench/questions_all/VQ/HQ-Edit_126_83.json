      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of creating a miniature 3D scene within a wooden shadow box, evaluate whether the addition of the shadow box frame around the image maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image features a flat portrait composition; introducing a 3D shadow box requires consistent depth cues, realistic wood texture, and proper lighting to avoid unnatural edges or floating elements. This editing affects overall realism and spatial logic.",
      "question": "Is the wooden shadow box frame seamlessly integrated around the image with consistent lighting and realistic wood grain texture, without visible seams or floating edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using pastel tones for the background to enhance elegance, assess whether the background color has been modified to a soft pastel shade that complements the hanbok without clashing or distorting the original lighting. The original background is neutral beige; changing it must preserve natural luminance and avoid artificial color casts.",
      "question": "Has the background been updated to a soft pastel tone that harmonizes with the hanbok’s colors and maintains even illumination without unnatural color shifts or banding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding tiny embroidered floral details to the garment, evaluate whether the new embroidery patterns are consistent in style and scale with the existing floral motifs on the hanbok. The original fabric already contains delicate floral designs; added details must not disrupt the fabric's texture or appear as pixelated or overly sharp overlays.",
      "question": "Are the newly added embroidered floral details on the hanbok consistent in size, style, and texture with the existing patterns, without appearing overdrawn or artificially layered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a delicate fan in her hand, evaluate whether the fan is realistically positioned in the hand, with correct proportions and natural grip. The hand in the original image is relaxed and folded at the waist; inserting a fan must not distort finger count, joint angles, or skin texture. It must also align with the hand’s orientation and shadows.",
      "question": "Is the fan held naturally in the hand with correct finger placement, no extra fingers, and consistent shading and material texture matching the rest of the hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a small blooming cherry blossom tree behind the figure, evaluate whether the tree is proportionally scaled and spatially plausible within the scene. It should not overlap incorrectly with the figure or appear out of focus due to depth mismatch. The tree must have natural branch structure, bloom density, and lighting consistent with the environment.",
      "question": "Is the cherry blossom tree positioned behind the figure with appropriate depth, realistic branching, and bloom distribution, without overlapping the body or casting inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
