      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the husky into a life-sized plush toy with exaggerated proportions, particularly oversized paws, evaluate whether the paw size has been altered in a way that maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows proportionally sized paws relative to the body; increasing their size must not result in geometric distortion or unnatural shape deformation.",
      "question": "Are the paws of the husky significantly larger than natural proportions but still maintaining smooth, rounded shapes without distorted edges or broken geometry?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing fur texture with soft, velvety fabric, assess whether the material change at the fur surface results in a uniform, consistent fabric appearance across the entire body. The original image features detailed, layered fur; converting it to fabric should avoid patchy textures or abrupt transitions between materials.",
      "question": "Is the entire body covered in a seamless, velvety fabric texture that uniformly replaces the original fur without visible seams, texture inconsistencies, or areas where fur remains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding embroidered facial features, including bright blue eyes, examine whether the eyes have been replaced with stitched patterns that resemble embroidery while retaining clarity and symmetry. The original image shows realistic, reflective eyes; the embroidered version must preserve eye placement and alignment without misalignment or unnatural stitching artifacts.",
      "question": "Are the eyes replaced with clearly defined, symmetrical embroidered patterns that maintain proper positioning and spacing relative to the nose and ears, without jagged lines or misplaced stitches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of giving the husky an extra-fluffy tail, assess whether the tail has been modified to appear excessively voluminous but still retains a natural shape and flow. The original tail is thick and bushy; exaggerating its fluffiness must not cause unnatural clumping, floating sections, or separation from the body.",
      "question": "Does the tail appear significantly fuller and fluffier than in the original image but remain attached to the body with a continuous, cohesive shape and no floating or detached segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of positioning the plush toy on a clean wooden shelf with a minimalist backdrop, evaluate whether the background has been changed to include a flat, neutral surface (wooden shelf) and plain wall. The original snowy environment must be replaced entirely without blending or residual elements like snow or trees.",
      "question": "Has the original snowy landscape and surrounding trees been fully replaced by a clean wooden shelf and minimalist backdrop, with no traces of snow, trees, or sky remaining in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
