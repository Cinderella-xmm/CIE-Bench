      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a miniature chibi-style parrot diorama within a glass dome, this involves transforming the original large-scale realistic macaw into a stylized, smaller version. The editing position is centered on the main parrot in the foreground. This transformation requires altering scale, proportions, and facial features to achieve a chibi style while maintaining visual coherence with the surrounding environment. The question evaluates whether the resized and stylized parrot retains natural textures and avoids unnatural distortions in shape or material.",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style parrot maintain smooth feather textures and proportional body parts without visible warping or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the parrot on a branch encircled by vibrant, oversized leaves, the editing target includes the branch and surrounding foliage. The original image already contains a moss-covered branch with natural leaf shapes. The addition of oversized leaves must not disrupt the spatial logic or introduce inconsistent scaling. This question assesses whether the added leaves appear physically plausible in size and texture relative to the existing elements.",
      "question": "Are the oversized leaves around the branch proportionally larger than surrounding foliage without appearing stretched or unnaturally shaped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding tiny, dew-like crystal beads on the leaves, the editing target is the surface of the leaves in the vicinity of the parrot. These beads must be small, transparent, and reflect light realistically. The presence of such micro-elements can easily introduce artifacts like halos, blurring, or unnatural highlights if not rendered properly. This question checks for visual fidelity in fine details.",
      "question": "Do the crystal beads on the leaves appear as clear, spherical droplets with subtle reflections and no visible digital artifacts or smudging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of including a minuscule explorer sketching the parrot from another branch, the editing target is a new character introduced at a distance on a secondary branch. This figure must be proportionally tiny compared to the parrot and positioned logically within the scene. The question evaluates structural consistency—whether the explorer's posture, scale, and placement follow physical plausibility and do not conflict with the depth and perspective of the scene.",
      "question": "Is the explorer positioned on a separate branch at a believable distance and scale, with correct limb orientation and no distortion in form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a glass dome with a wooden base featuring etched tribal patterns, the editing target is the lower portion of the image where the dome’s base would be located. This involves introducing a new structural element (the dome) that must integrate seamlessly with the jungle background. The wood texture and tribal patterns must match the environmental theme and avoid artificial edges or mismatched lighting.",
      "question": "Does the base of the glass dome feature a consistent wood texture with etched tribal patterns that blend naturally into the rainforest setting without sharp edges or lighting inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
