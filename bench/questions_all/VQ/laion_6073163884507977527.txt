Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the rustic house scene into a miniature diorama within a glass-domed terrarium. This involves enclosing the entire scene under a transparent dome, which affects the overall composition and spatial perception. The original image shows an open-air rustic house with visible sky and no enclosure. Therefore, adding a glass dome must maintain transparency, reflectivity, and structural coherence without distorting the underlying scene. Attention must be paid to whether the dome introduces unnatural refractions, distortions, or occlusions that compromise realism.
-Sub requirement 1: Add a transparent glass dome over the entire scene, ensuring it does not introduce visual artifacts such as unnatural reflections, warping of underlying elements, or inconsistent lighting effects.

-<Thinking Process 2>: The instruction specifies adding mossy green pathways. In the original image, there are already textured ground areas made of cork-like material. The new pathways must integrate seamlessly with existing textures and terrain levels, especially near the steps leading to the house. The addition must avoid abrupt texture transitions or unnatural color shifts between moss and surrounding materials.
-Sub requirement 2: Introduce mossy green pathways on the ground surface, particularly along the approach to the house, ensuring natural integration with existing textures and consistent elevation alignment.

-<Thinking Process 3>: Tiny shrubs are to be added around the house. The original image already contains some small greenery near the base of the structure. New shrubs must match in scale, density, and texture with existing vegetation to preserve visual consistency. They should not appear disproportionately large or artificially placed.
-Sub requirement 3: Add small shrubs around the base of the house and along the pathway, ensuring they are proportionally scaled and blend naturally with existing plant elements.

-<Thinking Process 4>: A lake with a shimmering silver surface is to be introduced for contrast. The original image has no water feature. The lake must be positioned logically—likely adjacent to the house or near the path—and must have a reflective surface that mimics water behavior (e.g., subtle ripples, light reflection). It must not disrupt the terrain or appear floating without grounding.
-Sub requirement 4: Insert a lake with a silver reflective surface near the house, ensuring it conforms to physical plausibility (e.g., proper depth, edge definition, and interaction with surrounding terrain).

-<Thinking Process 5>: Delicate fairy lights are to be woven around miniature trees. The original image includes one prominent tree with reddish-brown foliage. Adding lights must not obscure or distort the tree’s structure; they should follow natural branching patterns and emit soft glow without introducing halos or unnatural brightness.
-Sub requirement 5: Add fairy lights around the tree, ensuring they follow the branch structure and produce a soft, diffused illumination without causing overexposure or halo artifacts.

-<Thinking Process 6>: A small bridge is to cross the lake and lead to the entrance. The bridge must connect two land masses across the lake and maintain structural integrity—consistent width, realistic material (e.g., wood or stone), and alignment with the terrain. It must not float or tilt unnaturally.
-Sub requirement 6: Place a small bridge spanning the lake, connecting the far bank to the house entrance, ensuring it has consistent geometry, proper support, and matches the scale and style of the environment.

-<Thinking Process 7>: The overall transformation must preserve the rustic aesthetic while integrating fantasy elements like fairy lights and a terrarium dome. The balance between realism and stylization must remain coherent—no element should appear out of place due to mismatched materials or proportions.
-Sub requirement 7: Maintain stylistic and material coherence across all added elements (dome, lake, bridge, lights) so that the final scene appears unified and visually plausible despite fantastical additions.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a transparent glass dome over the entire scene, evaluate whether the dome is rendered with appropriate transparency, minimal distortion, and consistent lighting interaction. The dome must not warp the house, tree, or ground beneath it, nor introduce artificial reflections or shadows that break realism.
Question: Does the glass dome cover the entire scene without distorting the underlying elements such as the house, tree, or ground?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding mossy green pathways, assess whether the new moss paths are integrated with the existing ground texture and elevation. The transition between moss and surrounding cork-like material must be smooth, with no sharp edges or color mismatches.
Question: Are the mossy green pathways aligned with the terrain level and blended naturally with the surrounding ground texture?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding tiny shrubs, check whether the new shrubs match the scale and appearance of existing vegetation. They should not appear oversized or clustered in unnatural patterns, and their leaf texture should be consistent with the rest of the foliage.
Question: Do the newly added shrubs have a size and texture consistent with the existing plants in the scene?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of inserting a lake with a shimmering silver surface, verify that the lake has defined edges, realistic depth, and reflects light appropriately. It must not appear flat or disconnected from the terrain, and its position should allow logical access via the bridge.
Question: Is the lake positioned on the ground with defined edges and a reflective surface that interacts realistically with surrounding elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of weaving fairy lights around the tree, determine whether the lights follow the natural branching pattern and emit a soft glow without creating bright halos or overexposed areas. The lights should not obscure the tree's structure.
Question: Are the fairy lights wrapped around the tree branches in a way that follows their shape and emits a soft, uniform glow without harsh highlights?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing a small bridge across the lake, evaluate whether the bridge connects two solid land masses, maintains consistent width and height, and has supports that appear structurally sound. It must not float or tilt unnaturally.
Question: Does the bridge span the lake with stable supports and connect directly to the ground on both sides without floating or tilting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q7: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining stylistic and material coherence, assess whether all added elements (dome, lake, bridge, lights) share a consistent visual language. The materials should not clash—e.g., metallic-looking bridge on a wooden-style house—and the lighting should be harmonious.
Question: Are all added elements (dome, lake, bridge, lights) rendered with materials and lighting that match the rustic, natural aesthetic of the original scene?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
