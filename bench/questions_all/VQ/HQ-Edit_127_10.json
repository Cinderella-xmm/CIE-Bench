      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining geometric coherence in the dual-tier snow globe structure, this question evaluates whether the upper and lower tiers are visually separated by a clear boundary and properly scaled relative to each other, ensuring no floating or misaligned elements. The presence of a transparent dome or enclosure should be implied through lighting and depth cues.",
      "question": "Are the upper and lower tiers clearly defined with consistent perspective and proportional scaling, and is there a visible separation between them that suggests a layered structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement for metallic hues in the upper-tier skyline, this question assesses whether the buildings exhibit reflective, metallic surfaces with appropriate shading and texture, avoiding flat or cartoonish appearances that would compromise realism.",
      "question": "Do the buildings in the upper tier have a metallic sheen with subtle reflections and gradients that match the lighting direction, and are there no flat or unnaturally uniform color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement for natural-looking forested gardens in the lower tier, this question checks whether the trees and shrubs have organic shapes, varied sizes, and realistic leaf textures, avoiding repetitive patterns or blocky rendering typical of low-resolution or AI-generated vegetation.",
      "question": "Are the trees and bushes in the lower tier composed of irregular, naturally shaped forms with varying heights and densities, and do they lack repeating texture tiles or unnatural symmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement for silvery flakes drifting between tiers, this question examines whether the particles appear as soft, semi-transparent elements with motion blur and depth variation, rather than sharp, static dots or jagged lines that suggest digital artifacts.",
      "question": "Are the silvery flakes distributed across the space between tiers with soft edges, slight blurring, and depth-based opacity, indicating movement through air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement for detailed cobblestone base and street lamps, this question evaluates whether the base features individual stone blocks with realistic texture and wear, and whether the street lamps have consistent design and proper scale relative to the scene.",
      "question": "Does the base show individually rendered cobblestones with visible grout lines and surface variations, and are the street lamps proportionally sized and evenly spaced along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement for structural consistency of the Eiffel Towers within the snow globe, this question checks whether both towers retain accurate architectural details, correct proportions, and symmetrical alignment, avoiding distortion or stretching that would break visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are both Eiffel Towers structurally intact with correct lattice patterns, uniform scaling, and no stretched or compressed sections that deviate from their known design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
