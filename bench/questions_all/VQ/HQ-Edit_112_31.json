      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the horse’s head size to be disproportionately large, this question evaluates whether the enlargement of the head maintains proportional consistency with the rest of the body and avoids unnatural stretching or compression of facial features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. The goal is to ensure the transformation into a chibi style does not introduce geometric distortions that break structural coherence.",
      "question": "Is the horse’s head enlarged proportionally so that facial features like the eyes and muzzle remain clearly defined and undistorted?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the horse’s fur with soft brown fabric texture, this question checks whether the texture of the body matches the expected appearance of textile material—such as visible weave, slight nap, and matte finish—without exhibiting unnatural gloss, sharp edges, or inconsistent shading that would suggest a digital artifact.",
      "question": "Does the body of the plush horse display a consistent fabric texture with soft, non-reflective surfaces and no abrupt transitions between color regions?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding embroidered eyes and a smile, this question examines whether the facial features appear as stitched elements, with visible thread lines, slight raised contours, and integration into the fabric surface. It ensures the eyes are not digitally painted but resemble actual embroidery.",
      "question": "Are the eyes and mouth of the plush horse depicted with visible stitching patterns and raised texture consistent with embroidery?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of shortening and stubbifying the legs, this question evaluates whether the legs maintain structural integrity as part of a plush toy—specifically, whether they are uniformly thick, lack unnatural bends or joints, and do not appear stretched or compressed beyond physical plausibility for a stuffed object.",
      "question": "Do the legs of the plush horse appear short and thick with smooth, rounded shapes and no distorted or broken geometry?",

      "question": "Are the dandelions in the foreground composed of flat, circular felt-like discs on straight stems, lacking naturalistic detail or depth?",
