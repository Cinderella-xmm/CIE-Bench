Q1:  
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of removing the people on top of the train, the operation involves ensuring that the train surface remains intact and realistic after removal. Focus on whether the texture and material of the train surface appear natural post-editing, avoiding any visible unnatural artifacts or gaps where the people were removed.   
Question: Does the area on the train where people were previously sitting look natural without any obvious artifacts or gaps?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q2:  
Thinking process: Considering the addition of a conductor holding a flag with a logo atop the train, itâ€™s important that the conductor blends naturally into the scene. This involves checking if the conductor's placement matches the lighting and shadows of the environment, ensuring there are no unrealistic highlights or shadows disrupting the scene's coherence.  
Question: Is the conductor added atop the train well-integrated with the existing lighting and shadows, giving a natural appearance?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q3:  
Thinking process: Adding a conductor with a flag involves ensuring that the flag and its logo align with the train's theme and do not introduce any visual inconsistencies like incorrect proportions or misplaced logos. This also checks if the flag has a logical flutter or position relative to the train's movement.  
Question: Does the flag held by the conductor look natural, with proper proportions and a logical position relative to the train's motion?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q4:  
Thinking process: After removing the people from the train roof and adding the conductor, it's crucial to verify that the structural elements of the train remain consistent and undistorted. Any warping or misalignment of the train structure can break visual credibility.  
Question: Are there any distortions or misalignments in the train's structure near the area where people were removed, and the conductor was added?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The editing process should maintain the photo's overall composition and balance. Removing people and adding a conductor can affect the visual weight distribution. The scene should still feel balanced and natural without any noticeable shifts that disrupt the viewer's perception of stability.  
Question: Does the overall composition of the image remain balanced and stable after editing, with no noticeable shifts caused by the removal and addition of people?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
