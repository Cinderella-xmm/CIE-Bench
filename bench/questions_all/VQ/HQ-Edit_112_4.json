      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the Blue Jay must be transformed into a miniature sculpture while preserving its anatomical structure and proportions, this question evaluates whether the bird’s body, wings, tail, and head retain their correct shape and size relative to each other, and whether the material appearance (e.g., glossy or matte finish) suggests a sculptural form without deformation or unnatural stretching.",
      "question": "Does the bird’s body maintain accurate proportions and feather structure, with no distorted limbs, misplaced joints, or exaggerated features?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that a glass dome must be added around the bird with realistic transparency and reflections, this question checks for visual artifacts such as jagged edges, incorrect refraction, or missing reflections that would indicate poor rendering quality.",
      "question": "Is the glass dome transparent with smooth surfaces, showing consistent reflections and refractions without visible seams, distortions, or pixelation?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the wooden perch must appear physically plausible and properly positioned, this question assesses whether the wood has natural grain patterns, appropriate thickness, and stable placement beneath the bird, avoiding floating or unsupported structures.",
      "question": "Is the wooden perch textured with realistic grain and positioned securely under the bird, with no gaps or floating sections suggesting instability?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that ivy must grow naturally upward along the structure, this question evaluates whether the vines follow logical growth paths, have correctly shaped leaves, and do not intersect improperly with the glass dome or bird.",
      "question": "Do the ivy vines curve naturally upward along the structure, with leaves spaced appropriately and no overlapping or clipping through the glass dome or bird?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that tiny crafted leaves and a miniature tree stump must be added at scale and with proper texture, this question checks if these elements match the size of the bird sculpture, exhibit detailed textures (like bark or leaf veins), and are placed logically within the scene.",
      "question": "Are the crafted leaves and tree stump proportionally small compared to the bird, with visible texture details and positioned on the moss-covered base without appearing out of place or misaligned?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the moss-covered base must have natural texture and color variation, this question evaluates whether the moss appears soft, layered, and integrated with the surrounding environment, without flat patches or artificial-looking borders.",
      "question": "Does the moss-covered base show variation in color and texture, resembling real organic growth, with no sharp edges or uniformity suggesting digital pasting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that lighting must remain consistent with the original image, this question checks whether shadows fall correctly under the dome and perch, and whether highlights align with the sun position in the upper right, maintaining depth and realism.",
      "question": "Are shadows cast by the bird, perch, and dome consistent with the light source in the upper right, with soft gradients and no mismatched highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
