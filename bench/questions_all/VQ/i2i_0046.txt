Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of applying a faded effect while ensuring it does not degrade the overall authenticity and natural appearance, assess if the faded effect maintains the details and texture of the main subject and the surroundings appropriately.
Question: Are the details and textures of the skateboarder and the urban background preserved despite the application of the faded effect?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement to add a white border with the caption "11:13 AM" at the bottom, examine if the addition of the border and caption integrates naturally without disrupting the visual flow and structural coherence of the image.
Question: Does the white border and text "11:13 AM" blend naturally into the image without introducing any visual distractions or unnatural breaks?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the sub requirement to incorporate a paper-like grain texture, evaluate if this effect enhances the Polaroid-style aesthetic while avoiding degradation of fine image details.
Question: Is the paper-like grain texture applied uniformly across the image without causing noticeable loss of detail or introduction of unnatural patterns?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: To address the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility after editing, check whether the modified polaroid effect retains the proportion and physical rationality of the skateboarder and the elements in the scene.
Question: Do the proportions and physical relationships between the skateboarder, the skateboard, and the background elements remain consistent and logical after applying the Polaroid effect?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of avoiding the introduction of unnatural textures and artifacts during editing, scrutinize if any distortions or unwanted artifacts appear around the edges of the main subject or within the applied effects.
Question: Are the edges of the skateboarder and the skateboard smooth and free from any unnatural artifacts or distortions resulting from the editing process?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
