      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the church into a whimsical animation style with simplified, exaggerated outlines, evaluate whether the structural coherence and geometric integrity of the church remain intact despite stylistic changes. The original image shows a well-defined church with a steeple, arched windows, and a door; any distortion in these elements (e.g., bent lines, inconsistent proportions) would compromise visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are the outlines of the church's steeple, roof, and walls clearly defined and geometrically consistent, without broken or warped edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering the stained-glass windows as vibrant and stylized, assess whether the window designs maintain internal consistency and avoid unnatural textures or color bleeding. The original image features detailed stained-glass patterns in the tower and side windows; the edited version must preserve recognizable shapes while enhancing vibrancy without introducing artifacts.",
      "question": "Do the stained-glass windows display clear, coherent patterns with smooth color transitions and no pixelation or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing pine trees with candy-like motifs, evaluate whether the new tree forms are visually plausible within the whimsical style and do not introduce anatomical distortions or unnatural materials. The original trees have realistic bark textures and branching structures; their replacement must maintain a sense of form and spatial logic even if stylized.",
      "question": "Are the candy-like tree replacements composed of smooth, continuous shapes with consistent surface textures, and do they maintain plausible proportions relative to the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the dusk sky with a swirling, pastel-toned patchwork quilt, assess whether the sky pattern is seamlessly integrated and avoids abrupt transitions or unnatural gradients. The original sky has a gradient from orange to purple with stars; the edited version must retain celestial elements while introducing patchwork segments without visible seams or texture mismatches.",
      "question": "Does the patchwork quilt sky feature uniform stitching lines and consistent color blending between patches, with no visible seams or sharp discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining overall authenticity and natural appearance despite stylistic transformation, evaluate whether the lighting and shadows across the scene remain logically consistent. The original image has warm light emanating from the church windows casting soft glows on the ground; the edited version must preserve this illumination logic even with stylized elements.",
      "question": "Do the light sources from the church windows cast consistent, soft shadows on the surrounding grass and path, matching the direction and intensity of the internal glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
