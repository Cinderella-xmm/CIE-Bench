      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the pancake stack into anthropomorphic characters with big, mischievous eyes, evaluate whether the addition of facial features (eyes) on the pancakes maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The editing position is on the surface of the top pancake where eyes would be placed. The original image shows a smooth, rounded top surface with a pat of butter centered—adding eyes must not distort the natural texture or geometry of the pancake surface.",
      "question": "Are the eyes added to the pancake surfaces positioned symmetrically and proportionally consistent with the size and shape of the pancakes, without deforming the surrounding texture?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using the butter pat as a stylish hat for the anthropomorphic pancake siblings, assess whether the butter’s placement and shape remain physically plausible after transformation. The original image shows a rectangular butter pat resting on top of the upper pancake. Editing it into a \"hat\" may involve reshaping or repositioning, which could introduce unnatural edges or shadows.",
      "question": "Is the butter pat still recognizable as a solid block with clean edges and natural lighting, even after being stylized as a hat, without exhibiting warped or fragmented geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of turning syrup into a heroic cape flowing from the pancake stack, evaluate whether the syrup stream maintains fluid dynamics and material consistency. In the original image, syrup is pouring from a jug onto the pancakes in a thin, continuous stream. Transforming this into a \"cape\" requires extending the flow beyond physical realism but must avoid unnatural stretching or breaking of liquid form.",
      "question": "Does the syrup stream extend downward from the pancake stack in a continuous, smooth arc without abrupt breaks, pixelation, or unnatural viscosity that contradicts liquid behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing the pancake characters in a breakfast scene with coffee cups and scrambled eggs, assess whether these new elements are integrated seamlessly into the environment. The original image has a plate, wooden surface, greenery, and a hand holding a syrup jug. Adding background objects like coffee cups must not clash with existing lighting, perspective, or depth cues.",
      "question": "Are the added breakfast items (e.g., coffee cups, scrambled eggs) aligned with the depth and lighting of the original scene, maintaining consistent shadows and scale relative to the pancake stack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of using bold, playful handwritten font for speech bubbles and text boxes, evaluate whether the typography integrates naturally into the comic panel layout. The original image contains no text, so adding speech bubbles must not obscure key elements like the syrup pour or butter pat, and must follow readable spatial composition.",
      "question": "Are the speech bubbles and text boxes positioned in open areas of the frame without overlapping critical elements such as the pancake stack or syrup stream, and do they have clear, legible letterforms without jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
