Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the ceramic form into an elaborate puzzle piece sculpture using interlocking beige and brown puzzle pieces, this involves replacing the original smooth ceramic surface with a geometric, segmented structure. The editing targets the entire body of the ceramic object, particularly the face and rounded base. The key perceptual quality concern is whether the transition from a smooth, organic ceramic shape to angular puzzle pieces maintains structural coherence and avoids unnatural texture or shape distortions. The question evaluates whether the material appearance (puzzle pieces) is consistent and plausible across the surface.
Question: Are the beige and brown puzzle pieces uniformly aligned and interlocked across the surface of the sculpture without visible gaps, misalignments, or jagged edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of creating a smooth, continuous shape by carefully aligning the puzzle edges, the focus is on ensuring that the geometric transitions between puzzle pieces do not introduce visual breaks or discontinuities in the overall form. The original object has a rounded, head-like shape, so maintaining continuity despite the segmented design is critical for visual credibility. This question checks whether the edges of the puzzle pieces flow naturally along the curvature of the original form.
Question: Do the edges of the puzzle pieces follow the natural curvature of the original ceramic head shape without abrupt angular deviations or unnatural flattening?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the conical top with a smooth green-colored puzzle fragment, the editing targets the top portion of the head where the original green glaze exists. The new element must integrate seamlessly with the rest of the puzzle structure while preserving a smooth, coherent surface. The key concern is whether the replacement introduces texture inconsistencies or color mismatches that break the visual unity.
Question: Is the green puzzle fragment on the top of the head smooth and free of rough textures, cracks, or color variations that contrast with the surrounding beige and brown puzzle pieces?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of positioning the artwork horizontally on a plain white shelf, the editing affects the spatial orientation and background context. The original image shows the object upright on a neutral surface. Changing its orientation and adding a shelf requires evaluating whether the placement appears physically plausible and visually balanced. The question checks for proper alignment and grounding of the object within the new environment.
Question: Is the sculpture placed horizontally on the white shelf with stable contact and no floating or tilting effects, maintaining a natural shadow and perspective?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts such as unnatural textures and loss of fine details, the editing involves significant transformation of the original ceramic surface. The facial features—such as the eyes, eyebrows, mouth, and ears—are key areas where detail preservation is crucial. The question evaluates whether the puzzle piece transformation preserves the recognizable structure of these features without distorting their proportions or erasing defining characteristics.
Question: Are the facial features (eyes, eyebrows, mouth, ears) clearly preserved in shape and proportion despite being integrated into the puzzle piece design, without deformation or blurring?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
