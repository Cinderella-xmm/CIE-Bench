      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the lime wedge becomes a smiling cap, this edit modifies the shape and orientation of the lime slice. The question evaluates whether the lime retains its natural green color, texture, and edge definition after being reshaped to suggest a face. Any unnatural warping, color bleeding, or loss of detail would compromise authenticity.",
      "question": "Does the lime wedge retain its natural green hue and textured rind, with no visible distortion or pixelation, even after being shaped into a smiling cap?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that ice cubes act as eyes, the edit involves positioning two ice cubes symmetrically within the glass. The question checks whether their shape remains cubic and consistent with real ice, and whether they are physically plausible given the liquid level and glass curvature. Any deformation or floating appearance would indicate artifacting.",
      "question": "Are the two ice cubes positioned as eyes clearly defined as solid, translucent cubes with sharp edges and no deformation, and do they sit naturally within the liquid without appearing to float unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the sugared rim forms a grin, this edit alters the sugar coating’s appearance. The question assesses whether the sugar texture remains granular and consistent, and whether the \"smile\" shape is smoothly integrated without creating unnatural gaps, smudges, or color shifts.",
      "question": "Is the sugar rim along the glass edge uniformly granular and continuous, with no visible breaks, smearing, or artificial coloring that disrupts the natural appearance of salt/sugar crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to add a sombrero and maracas, these are new elements introduced into the scene. The question evaluates whether their materials (e.g., fabric weave, wooden handles, metallic beads) appear realistic and whether their shadows and scale align with the rest of the scene. Misalignment or incorrect proportions would reduce visual credibility.",
      "question": "Do the sombrero and maracas have consistent material textures (e.g., woven straw, wood grain, reflective beads), correct scale relative to the glass, and proper shadows that match the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to add colorful confetti, this edit introduces small, scattered elements. The question checks whether the confetti has varied colors, realistic paper-like textures, and appropriate depth cues (e.g., shadows, overlapping). Artificial flatness or uniformity would indicate poor integration.",
      "question": "Are the confetti pieces varied in color and shape, with soft edges and subtle shadows, and do they appear to lie on the surface without floating or overlapping unrealistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement to add the text “Fiesta Time!” at the top, this edit introduces a graphic element. The question evaluates whether the text is legible, stylistically consistent with a festive theme, and properly aligned with the scene’s perspective. Misplaced text or clipping artifacts would reduce perceived quality.",
      "question": "Is the text “Fiesta Time!” clearly visible, evenly spaced, and positioned at the top of the image without overlapping or distorting other elements, and does it have consistent stroke width and anti-aliasing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
