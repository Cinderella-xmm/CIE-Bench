Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the wings with large crystal shards in shades of opal and white, evaluate whether the new wing structure maintains geometric coherence and visual plausibility. The original wings are feathered and symmetrical, so the replacement must preserve bilateral symmetry and avoid unnatural shapes or broken geometry. The material transition from feathers to crystalline shards should not introduce jagged edges, inconsistent lighting, or texture mismatches that compromise realism.
Question: Are the crystal shards forming the wings symmetrically aligned and structurally coherent, without visible gaps, misaligned facets, or distorted geometry?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the hair into golden leafy strands interwoven like a crown, assess whether the hair retains natural volume and flow while transitioning to an ornamental style. The original hair has soft curls and realistic highlights; the edited version must maintain plausible strand direction, light interaction, and avoid unnatural clumping or floating elements. The leaf-like textures must integrate seamlessly with the hair’s base structure.
Question: Do the golden leafy strands follow the natural flow of the original hair and appear integrated without floating or disconnected sections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the shirt into smooth velvet while retaining the white tone, evaluate whether the material change preserves surface consistency and avoids artificial textures. The original shirt is a plain cotton-like fabric; the velvet transformation must show appropriate pile texture, subtle sheen, and consistent shading without pixelation, unnatural gloss, or texture repetition.
Question: Does the shirt display a uniform, soft velvet texture with natural shadowing and no repeating patterns or digital artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of setting the background to a deep gray wall to enhance focus on the transformed attributes, assess whether the new backdrop is flat, uniform, and free of distortions. The original background contains warm ambient lighting and architectural details; the replacement must eliminate these elements without introducing visible seams, color bleeding, or depth inconsistencies that disrupt visual credibility.
Question: Is the background a consistent deep gray wall with no visible edges, lighting anomalies, or remnants of the original scene?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency across all modified elements, evaluate whether the overall composition remains physically plausible. The crystal wings must be attached naturally to the back, the leafy hair must not overlap incorrectly with facial features, and the shirt must fit proportionally. Any misalignment, clipping, or unnatural intersection between elements would violate spatial logic.
Question: Are all edited elements—crystal wings, leafy hair, and velvet shirt—properly aligned with the body and each other, without clipping, overlapping errors, or positional distortion?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
