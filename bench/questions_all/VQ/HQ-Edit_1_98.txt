Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the violinist’s dress into a floral-engraved gown, this involves modifying the texture and pattern of the dress while preserving its shape and flow. The original dress is a plain, light-colored, mid-length garment with soft folds. The edit must maintain natural fabric draping and avoid unnatural textures or distorted patterns. The floral engraving should not disrupt the structural coherence of the dress or introduce artifacts such as jagged edges, mismatched seams, or inconsistent shading.
Question: Does the floral engraving on the dress appear seamlessly integrated into the fabric without visible texture breaks, misaligned patterns, or unnatural highlights?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of rendering the image in a vintage postcard style with sepia tones, this affects the overall color palette and contrast across the entire image. The original scene has warm natural lighting and vibrant greens and yellows. Converting to sepia tones requires tonal consistency across all elements—skin, clothing, furniture, plants, and background—without introducing color bleeding, uneven gradients, or loss of fine details like hair strands or plant leaves. The transition must preserve visual depth and avoid flattening the image.
Question: Are the sepia tones applied uniformly across all elements (including skin, dress, violin, window frame, and plants) without localized color distortions or loss of detail in shadows or highlights?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of redesigning the window view into a dreamy, painted landscape of abstract swirls, this replaces the realistic outdoor scenery with an artistic interpretation. The original view shows trees and foliage through a multi-paned window. The new design must maintain the geometric integrity of the window panes and ensure that the abstract swirls do not bleed into the interior space or create inconsistencies in perspective. The transition from real to painted must be visually plausible within the context of a stylized postcard aesthetic.
Question: Do the abstract swirls in the window view remain confined within the window panes and align correctly with their borders, without overlapping into the room or distorting the window structure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of embellishing the violin with gold inlays, this involves adding decorative metallic elements to the instrument's body and scroll. The original violin has a natural wood finish with dark varnish. The gold inlays must be placed realistically along edges or contours without disrupting the violin’s shape or creating floating, disconnected pieces. The material must reflect light appropriately and integrate with the existing wood grain and curves.
Question: Are the gold inlays on the violin positioned along logical contours of the instrument and do they exhibit consistent metallic sheen and reflection without appearing detached or misaligned?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a decorative handwritten music score as a border, this introduces a new element around the image edge. The original composition is centered on the violinist with no external border. The added music score must follow a consistent line style and spacing, avoiding interruptions in the image’s framing or overlap with key elements like the figure or window. It must not distort the underlying image or introduce textural mismatches with the rest of the artwork.
Question: Is the handwritten music score border evenly spaced, legible, and aligned along the image edge without intersecting or obscuring any part of the violinist, window, or foreground objects?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
