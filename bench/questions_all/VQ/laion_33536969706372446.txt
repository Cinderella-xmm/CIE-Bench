Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction requires transforming the existing canopy bed into a Baroque-style grandiose structure. This involves significant changes to the bed's structural design, materials, and decorative elements. The original canopy bed has a simple wooden frame with sheer white curtains, which must be replaced with deep burgundy drapery, ornate gold woodwork, and oil-painted cherub motifs on pillows. These modifications affect multiple perceptual quality dimensions: realism (due to material and style shift), structural coherence (due to architectural redesign), texture authenticity (drapery and wood finish), and visual plausibility (proportions and lighting interaction). Therefore, sub requirements must evaluate whether these changes preserve natural appearance, avoid artifacts, maintain geometric integrity, and ensure realistic material representation.

-Sub requirement 1: Replace the current white sheer canopy with deep burgundy drapery; evaluate whether the new fabric appears physically plausible in terms of drape, fold, and shadowing, and whether it integrates naturally with the surrounding environment without unnatural edges or texture repetition.
-Sub requirement 2: Modify the bed frame to include ornate gold woodwork consistent with Baroque style; assess whether the added carvings and gilding are structurally coherent, proportionally accurate, and free from distortions such as broken lines or inconsistent shading.
-Sub requirement 3: Replace floral patterns on pillows with oil-painted cherub imagery; determine if the new pillow designs appear as painted artworks rather than digital overlays, with proper depth, brushstroke texture, and integration into the pillow surface.
-Sub requirement 4: Ensure that all added elements (drapery, woodwork, cherubs) maintain consistent lighting and shadow behavior relative to the room’s ambient light source (ceiling sun-shaped fixture), avoiding floating shadows or mismatched highlights.
-Sub requirement 5: Verify that the overall composition retains spatial logic—e.g., the canopy height and width remain compatible with the room size, and no elements appear clipped, misaligned, or improperly scaled relative to furniture like the nightstand or rug.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the white sheer canopy with deep burgundy drapery, this question evaluates whether the new fabric exhibits natural folds, soft transitions between light and shadow, and realistic interaction with the ceiling light. It checks for artifacts such as jagged edges, unnatural transparency, or repeating textures that suggest low-resolution synthesis.
Question: Do the deep burgundy drapes hang naturally with smooth folds and consistent shadow gradients, and do they cast realistic shadows on the wall and floor?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding ornate gold woodwork to the bed frame, this question examines whether the new carvings and gilded surfaces are geometrically intact, proportionally correct, and visually integrated with the original wooden structure. It checks for distorted lines, misplaced details, or inconsistent material properties.
Question: Are the gold woodwork details on the bed frame continuous, symmetrical, and free from warped or broken geometric shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing floral patterns on pillows with oil-painted cherub images, this question evaluates whether the new artwork appears as a physical painting on fabric—specifically, whether it shows texture variation, depth, and edge blending consistent with real paint application, not a flat digital overlay.
Question: Do the cherub images on the pillows show visible brushstroke texture, subtle color gradients, and seamless integration into the pillow surface without sharp borders or pixelation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining consistent lighting across all modified elements, this question checks whether the shadows and highlights on the new drapery, woodwork, and pillows align with the direction and intensity of the ceiling light source, ensuring no floating or disconnected illumination effects.
Question: Do the shadows cast by the new canopy drapes and gold woodwork match the direction of the ceiling light and fall consistently on adjacent walls and floor?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving spatial logic and structural coherence, this question verifies whether the transformed bed remains proportionally balanced within the room—i.e., its height, width, and depth are consistent with the surrounding furniture and ceiling clearance, avoiding clipping or unrealistic scaling.
Question: Is the redesigned canopy bed fully contained within the room boundaries, with no parts extending beyond the ceiling or overlapping the wall, and does it maintain a realistic scale relative to the nightstand and rug?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
