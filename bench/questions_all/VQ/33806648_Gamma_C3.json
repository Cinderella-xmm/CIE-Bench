      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the rock arch into a stone guardian creature while preserving structural coherence, evaluate whether the new skeletal wing-like extensions replace the arch’s outline without causing geometric distortion or floating appearance. The extensions must logically connect to the rock mass and not break the continuity of the surrounding terrain.",
      "question": "Do the skeletal wing-like extensions emerge naturally from the rock arch's edges without gaps, floating sections, or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that crystalline growths must match the rock’s texture and lighting, assess whether the added crystals have appropriate reflectivity and color integration with the surrounding stone. They should not appear overly shiny or mismatched in hue compared to the natural rock.",
      "question": "Are the crystalline growths along the arch’s curve textured and colored to blend with the surrounding rock, avoiding excessive gloss or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that glowing veins must follow natural patterns and avoid digital artifacts, examine whether the veins exhibit smooth gradients and organic branching, without sharp edges, pixelation, or abrupt transitions that suggest artificial addition.",
      "question": "Do the glowing veins across the surface follow natural mineral-like patterns and have soft, continuous light emission without jagged edges or blocky artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that runic symbols must appear carved into the rock, assess whether the symbols are embedded with proper depth, shadow, and texture alignment, avoiding flat or pasted-on appearances that disrupt the rock’s natural surface.",
      "question": "Are the runic symbols on the inner surface of the arch carved into the rock with consistent depth and shadow, matching the texture of natural erosion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that the radiant orb must emit realistic light, check whether the orb casts soft shadows and subtle glows on nearby surfaces, and whether its light direction aligns with the sunlight entering from the top-right of the frame.",
      "question": "Does the radiant orb emit light that matches the ambient lighting direction and creates realistic soft shadows and reflections on adjacent rock surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement that fine details like cracks and soil must remain intact, evaluate whether the ground and lower rock surfaces retain their original texture and detail, without blurring, smudging, or occlusion due to added elements.",
      "question": "Are the ground textures, cracks, and soil near the base of the arch preserved and not obscured or distorted by the added elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
