      "thinking_process": "Considering the sub requirement of maintaining the overall realism and natural appearance while redesigning the kangaroo into a Funko Pop figure box, we need to assess if the transformation introduces any unnatural textures or artifacts. The original kangaroo's fur texture and the surrounding environment should serve as references for evaluating the new design's authenticity.",
      "question": "Does the Funko Pop figure box maintain a natural texture similar to the original kangaroo's fur, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The sub requirement emphasizes retaining the core element's structural consistency and visual credibility during the redesign. The kangaroo's iconic shape and proportions should remain recognizable even in the Funko Pop style. The original image provides a clear view of the kangaroo's body structure, which helps in assessing the redesigned figure's fidelity.",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style kangaroo figure inside the box retain the correct proportions and structural consistency, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "To ensure the overall authenticity and natural appearance, the highly realistic version of the kangaroo figure outside the packaging should showcase intricate textures and lighting similar to the original image. The original image's lighting and shadow effects on the kangaroo provide a benchmark for evaluating the realism of the edited figure.",
      "question": "Does the highly realistic kangaroo figure outside the packaging display detailed textures and lighting consistent with the original image, enhancing its visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The sub requirement focuses on avoiding the introduction of artifacts such as unnatural textures and loss of details. The grassy base and hopping-related elements added to the chibi-style kangaroo figure should blend seamlessly with the overall design without disrupting the visual coherence. The original image's grass and environmental details offer a basis for comparison.",
      "question": "Are the grassy base and hopping-related elements integrated naturally into the chibi-style kangaroo figure, without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The sub requirement highlights the importance of maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility. The placement and orientation of the Funko Pop figure box and the realistic kangaroo figure should align logically within the scene. The original image's composition and the kangaroo's position relative to the path and surroundings help in assessing the edited image's spatial arrangement.",
      "question": "Does the composition and layout of the Funko Pop figure box and the realistic kangaroo figure beside it appear visually credible and structurally coherent within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
