      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enlarging the shopping bags and converting them into vibrant geometric patterns while maintaining their original shapes, this question evaluates whether the transformation preserves the geometric integrity of each bag. The original bags have defined rectangular and trapezoidal forms; after enlargement and stylization, they must still appear structurally sound without warped corners, misaligned edges, or overlapping layers that suggest digital corruption.",
      "question": "Do the enlarged shopping bags retain their original geometric shapes without distorted edges or broken polygons?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the coat to a velvety texture with a darker crimson tone, this question checks whether the new texture appears consistent across the entire garment. Velvet typically has a soft, slightly raised surface with directional light response. If the texture is applied unevenly or shows artificial flatness or overly sharp highlights, it breaks realism.",
      "question": "Is the velvety texture on the coat uniformly applied without unnatural shine or inconsistent surface details?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the gloves to a sleek, glossy finish, this question assesses whether the reflection and sheen on the gloves follow physical laws of light interaction. The fingers should show smooth curvature with reflections that match the direction of ambient light, and there should be no unnatural stretching or missing contours.",
      "question": "Are the glossy gloves visually consistent in shape and reflection, with no distorted finger joints or misplaced highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding abstract retail symbols around the subject on a matte card background, this question evaluates whether the symbols are placed in a way that respects spatial depth and does not intersect improperly with the subject or other elements. They should appear as part of the environment, not floating independently.",
      "question": "Are the abstract retail symbols positioned around the subject without overlapping or intersecting with her body or shopping bags?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding an open panel for personal messages, this question checks whether the panel is integrated into the composition with consistent lighting, color, and texture. It should appear as a natural extension of the postcard format without sharp edges, mismatched shadows, or conflicting perspectives.",
      "question": "Does the open panel for personal messages blend seamlessly into the background with matching lighting and texture?",
