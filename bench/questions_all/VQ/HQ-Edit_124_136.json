      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the musician into a Byzantine monk, the original figure’s facial features, attire, and headwear must be modified to reflect Byzantine monastic characteristics. The turban-like headdress in the original image must be replaced with a traditional monastic hood or cowl consistent with Byzantine iconography. This change affects overall authenticity and natural appearance, particularly in terms of material texture, shape, and proportion. The new headwear must not distort the face or create unnatural shadows or seams.",
      "question": "Does the headwear on the figure appear as a properly shaped and textured Byzantine monastic cowl without visible seams, unnatural folds, or geometric distortions?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding Aramaic scripts woven into the elaborate robe, the original ornate patterned fabric must now include script elements that are seamlessly integrated. These scripts must follow the natural flow of textile patterns and not appear as pasted-on text or disconnected symbols. The integration should preserve the fabric's texture and avoid breaking the continuity of the design.",
      "question": "Are the Aramaic scripts embedded within the robe’s pattern continuous, legible, and aligned with the fabric’s weave and decorative motifs without appearing artificially superimposed?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the instrument from a lute to a lyre with scribed bronze details, the original pear-shaped string instrument must be replaced with a lyre-style instrument featuring a triangular frame and horizontal arms. The material must shift from wood to bronze, with engraved inscriptions and metallic sheen. The transition must maintain structural coherence—strings must connect logically to tuning pegs and bridge—and avoid warped geometry or inconsistent shading.",
      "question": "Is the lyre-shaped instrument structurally coherent, with correctly proportioned arms, strings, and tuning pegs, and does it exhibit realistic bronze texture and engraved details without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of changing the lush field into an idyllic garden with olive trees, the background floral field must be replaced with olive trees and other garden elements. The trees must be proportionally sized, positioned naturally within the landscape, and cast appropriate shadows. The transition between foreground flowers and newly added trees must not show abrupt edges or texture mismatches.",
      "question": "Are the olive trees in the background realistically scaled, spaced, and shaded, and do they blend seamlessly with the surrounding environment without visible edges or texture discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adjusting the figure to a seated position on a carved stone bench, the original cross-legged posture must now rest on a stone structure. The bench must have defined carvings, consistent stone texture, and proper depth relative to the figure. The figure’s legs and feet must align naturally with the bench’s surface, avoiding floating limbs or unnatural angles.",
      "question": "Is the figure seated on a stone bench with visible carved details and realistic stone texture, and do the figure’s legs and feet rest naturally on the bench without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of blending Byzantine mosaic art style with jewel-toned colors and tessellated patterns, the entire scene must adopt a stylized aesthetic with geometric patterns and rich coloration. However, this transformation must not compromise realism—patterns should not override physical form, and colors must remain plausible under natural lighting. The figure’s clothing, background, and instruments should all reflect this style while retaining visual credibility.",
      "question": "Do the jewel-toned colors and tessellated patterns across the figure’s robe, instrument, and background maintain visual coherence and plausible lighting without overwhelming the forms or creating flat, non-reflective surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding small marble sculptures of cherubim and sacred symbols around the figure, these objects must be placed at ground level near the bench, with appropriate scale and material consistency. They must exhibit smooth marble texture, realistic reflections, and proper shadowing. Their placement must not obstruct the figure or appear randomly scattered.",
      "question": "Are the marble sculptures positioned naturally around the bench, with correct scale, smooth texture, and consistent lighting and shadows, without appearing misplaced or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
