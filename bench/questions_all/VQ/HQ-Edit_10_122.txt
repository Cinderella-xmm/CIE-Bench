Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the attire into traditional patterned textiles with vivid colors, evaluate whether the clothing's texture, color distribution, and geometric patterns appear consistent with real-world textile materials and cultural motifs. The original image shows a colorful, patterned top with distinct shapes and textures; the editing should maintain these features without introducing unnatural pixelation, repetitive artifacts, or inconsistent shading.
Question: Does the patterned textile on the character’s top display coherent geometric shapes, consistent color gradients, and natural fabric-like texture without visible distortions or repeating digital artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding intricate tribal motifs to the jewelry, assess whether the gold hoop earrings and necklaces now feature detailed engravings or symbolic designs that align with cultural authenticity and physical plausibility. The original image already includes gold jewelry; the editing must enhance detail without causing misshapen forms, broken lines, or unnatural material reflections.
Question: Are the tribal motifs on the gold earrings and necklaces clearly defined, proportionally accurate, and free from distorted edges or unrealistic surface reflections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of stylizing the background market scene into a lively, painterly depiction with abstracted umbrellas and rhythmic musical notes, determine whether the background elements retain structural coherence. The original image features market stalls with umbrellas and musical notes; the transformation must preserve recognizable shapes while avoiding warped geometry or floating elements.
Question: Do the abstracted umbrellas in the background maintain plausible proportions and spatial relationships, without overlapping or floating inconsistently relative to the market stalls?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of incorporating rhythmic musical notes to evoke community spirit, evaluate whether the musical notes are placed naturally within the scene and follow visual logic. The original image already has musical notes around the head; the edited version must ensure they do not appear clipped, misaligned, or unnaturally clustered.
Question: Are the musical notes distributed evenly and positioned along plausible trajectories around the character’s head, without sharp breaks or abrupt cutoffs in their paths?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility in the character’s hand gesture, assess whether the hand retains anatomical accuracy. The original image shows the right hand raised near the face; the edited version must preserve five fingers, natural joint angles, and skin texture without deformation or extra digits.
Question: Does the character’s right hand show five fingers with correct proportions, natural curvature, and realistic skin texture, without any missing, duplicated, or misshapen digits?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
