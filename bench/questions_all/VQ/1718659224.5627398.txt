Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the fortress into a cookie sculpture using golden-brown cookie dough with darker edges, evaluate whether the material transformation at the fortress walls and towers maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows a multi-tiered stone fortress with defined geometric shapes and textures; replacing it with cookie dough requires preserving its architectural form while introducing edible material properties. This includes checking if the texture of the cookie dough appears consistent across surfaces, especially at corners and edges where shadows and highlights should reflect baked dough characteristics.
Question: Do the fortress walls and towers exhibit a uniform golden-brown cookie dough texture with darker edges that match the lighting direction and do not show unnatural pixelation or inconsistent shading?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of creating waterfalls from finely piped royal icing, assess whether the waterfall elements in the edited image maintain physical rationality and natural appearance. In the original image, the waterfall flows from a cliffside into a pool below, forming a realistic cascade. Replacing this with royal icing must preserve the flow dynamics and volume of the water while reflecting the glossy, smooth, and slightly viscous nature of icing. Attention should be paid to how the icing interacts with the surrounding rock and whether it appears artificially stiff or overly rigid.
Question: Are the waterfalls rendered as smooth, continuous streams of royal icing that follow the natural contour of the cliff and show appropriate sheen and thickness without appearing clumped or broken?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of shaping trees from green-colored marzipan, evaluate whether the tree forms in the edited image retain their natural shape and proportion relative to the environment. The original image contains scattered shrubs and small trees along the canyon edges and base of the fortress. These must now appear as marzipan sculptures—soft, pliable, and slightly rounded—but still recognizable as vegetation. The key is ensuring they are not distorted or flattened, and that their placement respects the terrain's elevation and spacing.
Question: Are the trees formed from green marzipan positioned naturally on the terrain, maintaining plausible size and shape without appearing compressed, misshapen, or disconnected from the ground?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of placing the entire cookie castle on a large white ceramic platter, assess whether the platter integrates seamlessly with the scene without disrupting spatial logic. The original image features an expansive desert landscape with no visible surface beneath the fortress. Introducing a platter implies a sudden transition from natural terrain to a flat, artificial platform. This change must not introduce visual inconsistencies such as floating structures, mismatched scale, or unnatural shadowing under the platter.
Question: Is the white ceramic platter clearly visible beneath the cookie fortress, extending outward with clean edges and casting a soft shadow that aligns with the light source, without appearing to float or distort the surrounding terrain?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining overall authenticity and avoiding artifacts during material transformation, evaluate whether the transition between materials (e.g., cookie dough, royal icing, marzipan) is coherent and free of visual glitches. Specifically, check for seams, texture mismatches, or abrupt changes in detail level between adjacent elements like the fortress wall meeting the waterfall or the marzipan trees touching the cookie ground. The goal is to ensure all components appear crafted from edible materials without digital artifacts.
Question: Are there any visible seams, texture discontinuities, or abrupt transitions between the cookie dough fortress, royal icing waterfalls, and marzipan trees that suggest poor blending or rendering errors?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
