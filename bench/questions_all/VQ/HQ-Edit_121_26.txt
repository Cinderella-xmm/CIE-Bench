Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the character into ornate, richly textured armor with a flowing velvet cape, this involves replacing the original tribal attire and accessories with Renaissance-style elements. The editing position includes the character’s torso, limbs, and back area where the cape is attached. The focus is on whether the new armor maintains structural coherence, natural material textures (e.g., metallic sheen, fabric folds), and avoids unnatural seams or distortions in geometry, especially at joints and overlapping areas. The cape must flow naturally without clipping or floating artifacts.
Question: Does the ornate armor on the character's torso and limbs have consistent geometric structure and natural surface textures without visible distortion or broken edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the staff with an elaborate, gem-studded artifact, the editing position is the object held in the character’s right hand. This involves modifying both the shape and material properties of the original staff, which was decorated with feathers and organic materials. The new scepter must maintain physical plausibility—such as proper proportions, realistic gem placement, and coherent lighting interaction—without introducing unnatural reflections, misplaced facets, or inconsistent scale relative to the hand holding it.
Question: Is the gem-studded scepter proportionally accurate and physically plausible in size and shape relative to the character’s hand, with no distorted or misaligned gemstones?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a flowing velvet cape, the editing position is the back and shoulders of the character. The cape must appear to drape naturally under gravity, with correct fold directionality and texture consistency across its surface. It should not float unnaturally or intersect incorrectly with the body or armor. The material must resemble velvet with appropriate softness and light absorption, avoiding shiny or plastic-like artifacts.
Question: Does the velvet cape exhibit natural draping behavior with realistic folds and shadows, and does it avoid unnatural intersections or floating segments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of modifying the landscape to feature rolling hills and a distant castle while maintaining golden and earth tones, the editing position includes the background terrain, horizon line, and sky. The original image features flat savanna with acacia trees and a distant mountain. The new landscape must preserve depth perception, gradient transitions between terrain levels, and consistent lighting from the sun. The castle must be integrated seamlessly without abrupt edges or color mismatches, and its architecture must conform to Renaissance design principles.
Question: Are the rolling hills and distant castle integrated smoothly into the scene with consistent lighting and shadow alignment, avoiding sharp edges or color discontinuities?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of re-envisioning the character in a Renaissance style while retaining core identity, the editing position includes the entire figure, particularly facial features, posture, and hand positioning. The hand holding the scepter must retain anatomical correctness—five fingers, natural joint angles, and skin texture—without extra digits or unnatural curvature. The overall pose must remain balanced and structurally rational, avoiding floating limbs or disproportionate limbs.
Question: Does the character’s right hand holding the scepter show five correctly shaped fingers with natural joint alignment and skin texture, without deformation or extra digits?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
