      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the basket in the gnome’s left hand with a seed packet display, this question evaluates whether the new object maintains realistic proportions and integrates naturally with the hand and arm structure. The seed packet must not appear disproportionately large or small compared to the gnome’s hand, nor should it float or detach from the hand. Its texture should resemble paper or cardboard, consistent with packaging materials, and not clash with the stone-like finish of the gnome.",
      "question": "Is the seed packet in the gnome’s left hand proportionally sized and properly aligned with the hand, showing no signs of floating or unnatural attachment?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding faux soil and botanical illustrations around the base of the gnome, this question checks whether these elements are visually grounded and integrated. The soil should appear layered and textured, not flat or digitally pasted. The botanical illustrations should be positioned along the base edge without overlapping the gnome’s feet unnaturally. Their lines and shading should match the rustic theme and not exhibit jagged edges or color bleeding.",
      "question": "Are the faux soil and botanical illustrations at the base of the gnome seamlessly integrated, showing natural texture and proper alignment with the ground plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the flowers with plantable seed bombs, this question assesses whether the new objects in both hands are realistically shaped and textured. The seed bombs should be spherical with a rough, compacted soil appearance, fitting comfortably within the gnome’s grip. The fingers should not be stretched or bent unnaturally to hold them. There should be no visible gaps or distortions between the hand and the object.",
      "question": "Do the seed bombs in both hands have a natural spherical shape with appropriate surface texture and fit securely within the gnome’s hands without distorting finger positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying earthy texture graphics across added elements, this question evaluates whether the textures on the seed packet, seed bombs, soil, and illustrations are consistent with the original material tone and free from artifacts. The textures should not show repeating patterns, unnatural highlights, or mismatched shadows. They should blend with the overall stone-like finish of the gnome.",
      "question": "Are the earthy textures applied to the seed packet, seed bombs, soil, and illustrations consistent in style and free from visible artifacts such as pixelation or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring the entire composition functions as a coherent product package design, this question checks whether the layout of all elements—seed packet, seed bombs, soil, and illustrations—forms a balanced and logically arranged product presentation. The elements should not overlap awkwardly or appear randomly placed. The title \"Garden Gnome Blossoms\" should be legible and positioned in a way that suggests branding, without interfering with the gnome’s form.",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the edited image balanced and structured like a product package, with all elements arranged in a logical and non-cluttered manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
