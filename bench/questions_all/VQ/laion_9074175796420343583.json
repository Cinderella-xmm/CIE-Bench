      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding limbs and facial features to the pie, evaluate whether the newly added arms and face on the pie’s surface maintain natural appearance and structural coherence. Specifically, check if the limbs emerge from the crust in a way that respects the pie’s round shape and if the facial features (eyes, mouth) are proportionally placed and textured like baked dough, not painted or digitally overlaid.",
      "question": "Are the arms and face drawn on the pie’s surface consistent with the texture and color of the crust, without visible digital artifacts or mismatched shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of retaining the lattice design as a patterned apron, assess whether the lattice structure has been reinterpreted as fabric while preserving its original geometric integrity. Check if the lines remain continuous, unbroken, and aligned with the original crisscross pattern, and whether the material appears to have fabric-like softness rather than rigid pastry.",
      "question": "Does the lattice pattern retain its original grid structure and spacing, and does it appear as a draped fabric apron without broken or stretched lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the knife into a feather pen, evaluate whether the object has been morphed into a quill shape while maintaining realistic proportions and material consistency. Check if the blade portion has been replaced with a feather tip, and whether the handle still resembles wood but now supports a pen-like function.",
      "question": "Is the knife converted into a feather pen with a realistic quill tip and wooden shaft, and does it maintain a natural transition from the original knife shape without abrupt edges or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of introducing surrounding pastries, assess whether these new elements are properly scaled and positioned relative to the main pie. Check if they are grounded on the same surface, cast appropriate shadows, and share similar lighting and texture characteristics with the original pie.",
      "question": "Are the additional pastries positioned at a consistent distance and scale relative to the main pie, and do they cast realistic shadows and reflect the same lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding text bubbles, evaluate whether the speech bubbles are clearly readable, placed near the pie’s mouth, and do not overlap or distort the pie or background elements. Check if the font style and bubble outlines are clean and integrated into the scene without floating or clipping issues.",
      "question": "Are the text bubbles positioned close to the pie’s mouth, legible, and free from overlapping or clipping with the pie or plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding hands to the pie, evaluate whether the hands have a natural number of fingers (five per hand), correct anatomical proportions, and a grip that makes physical sense for holding a pen. Check if the hands appear to emerge from the pie’s side and are shaded consistently with the rest of the image.",
      "question": "Do the hands on the pie have exactly five fingers each, proper joint alignment, and a natural grip on the feather pen without deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
