      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying metallic textures to the cyclist’s outfit and helmet, evaluate whether the material transformation preserves structural integrity and realistic lighting behavior. The cyclist’s current fabric and plastic materials must transition to metallic without altering underlying geometry or creating unnatural specular highlights.",
      "question": "Do the metallic textures on the cyclist’s outfit and helmet reflect light consistently with the scene’s illumination and maintain accurate surface contours without warping?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding electric blue neon glow lines along the road edges and on the cyclist and car, assess whether these lines are smoothly rendered and do not obscure or distort existing features like road markings or vehicle details.",
      "question": "Are the electric blue neon glow lines along the road edges and on the cyclist and car smooth, evenly lit, and free from jagged edges or overlapping with real-world details like tires or license plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a transparent visor data display on the cyclist’s helmet, evaluate whether the digital overlay respects optical physics—such as transparency, refraction, and alignment—with the helmet’s surface and does not introduce visual artifacts like double images or misalignment.",
      "question": "Is the transparent visor data display on the cyclist’s helmet aligned with the helmet’s curvature, showing clear digital content without ghosting, blurring, or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of projecting holographic cycling stats near the escort car, evaluate whether the holograms are positioned correctly in space, properly scaled, and interact with light realistically (e.g., soft glow, no sharp outlines).",
      "question": "Are the holographic cycling stats near the escort car spatially coherent, appropriately sized relative to the car, and displayed with soft edges and ambient glow without casting incorrect shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining stylistic and structural coherence across all edited elements, evaluate whether the integration of metallic surfaces, neon glows, digital displays, and holograms creates a unified visual narrative without conflicting textures, lighting, or geometry.",
      "question": "Do all edited elements—including metallic finishes, neon glows, digital visor display, and holographic projections—coexist without visual contradictions such as mismatched lighting, texture clashes, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
