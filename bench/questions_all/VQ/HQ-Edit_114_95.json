      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the Eiffel Tower into a glass silhouette, evaluate whether the material transition from metal to glass is visually coherent and physically plausible. Glass should exhibit transparency, refraction, and reflection consistent with real-world optics. The presence of unnatural opacity, lack of reflection, or inconsistent translucency would indicate poor material rendering.",
      "question": "Does the glass-like surface of the transformed Eiffel Tower show natural transparency and subtle reflections consistent with real glass under overcast lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding embossed lattice patterns resembling the original tower’s structure, assess whether the patterns maintain accurate proportions and do not distort the tower’s geometry. These patterns should follow the curvature and angles of the original structure without appearing flattened, stretched, or misaligned.",
      "question": "Are the embossed patterns on the glass surface aligned with the original lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower and proportionally consistent across all levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a gold-plated base as the foundation, check whether the base integrates seamlessly with the glass body. It should have a realistic metallic finish, appropriate thickness, and proper alignment with the bottom of the tower. Any visible gaps, mismatched angles, or unrealistic shine would compromise authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the gold-plated base positioned correctly at the bottom of the tower, with smooth edges and consistent metallic texture that matches the scale and lighting of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating a Parisian skyline motif along the glass surface, evaluate whether the motif is subtly rendered, maintains correct perspective, and does not interfere with the tower’s structural clarity. The motif should appear etched or frosted into the glass, not overlaid as a separate layer.",
      "question": "Is the Parisian skyline motif visible along the glass surface without distorting the tower’s shape or appearing as a floating or disconnected element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing a minimalist logo at the bottle’s neck, assess whether the logo is cleanly rendered, properly scaled, and stylistically compatible with the rest of the design. It should not appear blurry, clipped, or misaligned with the neck’s curvature.",
      "question": "Is the logo at the neck of the bottle clearly defined, centered, and free from jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving structural coherence, verify that the overall shape of the tower remains geometrically sound after transformation. The arches, legs, and vertical supports should retain their original proportions and spatial relationships, avoiding warping or collapse of forms.",
      "question": "Are the main structural elements of the tower (legs, arches, central column) preserved in correct proportion and alignment, with no signs of stretching or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts, evaluate whether the edited image contains any visual anomalies such as blurring, ghosting, or unnatural lighting. The transitions between materials (glass, gold, sky) should be smooth, and shadows should match the ambient light.",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as pixelation, color bleeding, or unnatural reflections around the transformed tower or its components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
