Focus on the shape, perspective, and alignment of the sails relative to the water and horizon line.",
      "question": "Are the sails of the Sydney Opera House in the background correctly shaped and proportioned, with no warped edges or broken geometry?",

Ensure that the fluffiness appears three-dimensional and not flat or blocky, and that there are no abrupt texture transitions or pixelation.",
      "question": "Is the fur of the poodle rendered with consistent volume and softness, showing no flat areas or unnatural texture repetition?",
