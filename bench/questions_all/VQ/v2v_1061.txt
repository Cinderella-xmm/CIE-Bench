Q1: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of maintaining the overall realism and natural appearance while adding an anime-style badge influenced by the architecture, we need to assess if the badge blends naturally with the image's existing elements. The badge should mirror the vibrant domes and intricate patterns without disrupting the scene's authenticity.
Question: Does the badge maintain the same level of detail and texture as the vibrant domes and intricate patterns of the building, avoiding unnatural textures or loss of details?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement emphasizes retaining the core architectural elements' structural consistency and visual credibility. The badge should complement the architecture without distorting its geometric shapes or proportions.
Question: Are the geometric shapes and proportions of the badge consistent with the architectural style of the building, ensuring no distortion or breakage of shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: To ensure the badge's material (tassel) reflects reality and natural appearance, it should appear soft and flexible, matching the expected properties of tassels. The circular form of the badge should also look natural within the context of the image.
Question: Does the tassel material of the badge appear soft and flexible, and does the circular form look natural and undistorted?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement focuses on the hand presenting the badge, which should feature a lively design mirroring the vibrant domes. The hand should have a natural appearance, with correct finger count and ergonomic shape.
Question: Does the hand presenting the badge have a natural appearance, with no more than five fingers, and do the lines and shapes conform to ergonomics?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The badge's placement and integration into the image should maintain structural coherence and visual plausibility. It should not introduce any artifacts or disrupt the scene's overall composition and layout.
Question: Does the placement of the badge integrate seamlessly into the image, maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility without introducing any artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
