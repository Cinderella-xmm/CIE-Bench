Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "Adding 'Sharp' at the top left and ensuring the addition doesn't affect the overall realism and natural appearance", consider if the insertion maintains coherent style and avoids introducing unnatural textures. 
Question: Does the text 'Sharp' at the top left blend naturally into the image without causing any visible disruption to the scissors or background?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "Maintaining material and texture authenticity while adding 'Clean' at the bottom right", ensure the sketch style complements rather than detracts from the image's visual coherence.
Question: Is the text 'Clean' at the bottom right rendered in a sketch style that matches the image's aesthetic, without introducing any artifacts or visual noise?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "Ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility when adding text elements", verify that the added text does not distort the scissorsâ€™ geometry or create any inconsistencies.
Question: Are the proportions of the scissors preserved, with no apparent distortion in their shape caused by the placement of the texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean'?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of "Avoiding introduction of unnatural textures or degradation of details", confirm the fine details of the scissors remain intact after text addition.
Question: Do the fine details, like reflections and edges of the scissors, remain sharp and unaffected by the presence of the texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean'?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement of "Ensuring the composition retains visual plausibility", assess if the overall arrangement of elements supports a natural appearance.
Question: Does the composition of the image, including the positioning of the scissors and the added texts, appear balanced and maintain visual plausibility?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
