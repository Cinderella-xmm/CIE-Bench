Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction requires transforming the three figures into mythical guardians with armor reflecting oceanic elements like coral and waves. This involves significant modification of their clothing, body structure, and possibly facial features. The original image shows three individuals standing on rocks at sunset, with distinct physical characteristics (e.g., long hair, beard, glasses). The transformation must preserve anatomical proportions and avoid unnatural distortions while introducing new materials (armor) that should appear integrated and physically plausible. The armor must reflect oceanic themes without breaking geometric or material coherence.
-Sub requirement 1: Modify the clothing and body of all three figures to include ocean-themed armor (coral, wave patterns), ensuring the armor maintains structural consistency with human anatomy and does not introduce distorted shapes or broken geometry.
-Sub requirement 2: Ensure the armor materials (coral, waves) have natural textures and do not appear pixelated, stretched, or unnaturally layered over skin or clothing.
-Sub requirement 3: Verify that the addition of armor does not alter the number of limbs or fingers, especially in visible hands (e.g., right hand of the person on the right, left hand of the person on the left), preserving ergonomic shape and count.

-Thinking process 2: The background needs enhancement to a mystical sky with vivid blues and purples, framing the figures in silhouette. The original image has a realistic sunset gradient from orange to blue. The edited version must maintain atmospheric depth and avoid abrupt color transitions or artificial-looking gradients.
-Sub requirement 4: Enhance the sky colors to include deep blues and purples while preserving smooth gradients and avoiding banding or color artifacts.
-Sub requirement 5: Ensure the silhouettes of the figures remain intact and are not blurred, fragmented, or misaligned with the background lighting.

-Thinking process 3: The title "Sunset Guardians of the Coastlines" must be added using bold, serif lettering with ancient, weathered textures mimicking ocean spray. This involves adding text at the bottom of the image, which must not obscure key elements and must integrate naturally with the scene.
-Sub requirement 6: Add typography at the bottom of the image with weathered texture resembling ocean spray, ensuring the letters are legible, properly aligned, and do not introduce jagged edges or unnatural texture repetition.

-Thinking process 4: Subtle ocean creature motifs (e.g., seashells, tentacles, fish) must be incorporated into the armor designs. These elements must be small-scale and contextually appropriate, not distracting or visually jarring.
-Sub requirement 7: Integrate small ocean creature motifs into the armor design without disrupting the overall form or creating visual noise or unnatural overlaps.

-Thinking process 5: The overall composition must maintain visual credibility—figures should remain proportionally correct, shadows should align with light source (sun), and the interaction between figures and environment (rocks, sea) should remain coherent.
-Sub requirement 8: Ensure the lighting direction is consistent with the sunset position (behind the figures), casting appropriate shadows and maintaining silhouette integrity.
-Sub requirement 9: Confirm that the figures' positions relative to the rocks and sea remain physically plausible—no floating or unnatural placement.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of modifying the clothing and body of all three figures to include ocean-themed armor, this question evaluates whether the armor's integration preserves anatomical structure and avoids unnatural distortions. Specifically, the central figure’s torso and arms must retain natural proportions, and the armor should not cause bulging, stretching, or geometric breaks.
Question: Do the armor elements on the central figure's torso and arms follow natural human body contours without causing distorted shapes or broken geometry?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of ensuring natural textures for the armor materials (coral, waves), this question checks whether the textures appear seamless and physically plausible. The rightmost figure’s jacket area, where armor might be applied, should not show repeating patterns, blurring, or artificial layering.
Question: Are the textures of the ocean-themed armor on the rightmost figure’s jacket smooth and continuous without visible tiling or unnatural blending?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving hand anatomy, this question focuses on the visible right hand of the rightmost figure. The number of fingers, spacing, and joint alignment must conform to human ergonomics. Any added armor should not increase finger count or deform joints.
Question: Does the right hand of the rightmost figure have exactly five fingers with natural spacing and joint curvature, even with armor applied?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of enhancing the sky with vivid blues and purples while maintaining smooth gradients, this question assesses whether the color transition from orange near the horizon to blue/purple above is seamless and free of banding or sharp edges.
Question: Is the sky gradient from the horizon upward smooth and free of color banding or abrupt transitions between orange, blue, and purple hues?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding weathered, ocean-spray-style typography at the bottom, this question checks whether the text integrates naturally without jagged edges, misalignment, or texture repetition. The text should be positioned below the figures and not overlap with critical elements like the sea or rocks.
Question: Is the typography at the bottom of the image clearly legible, properly aligned, and textured with ocean-spray effects without repeating patterns or sharp edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of incorporating subtle ocean creature motifs into the armor, this question evaluates whether these elements are small, contextually appropriate, and do not disrupt the armor’s design. For example, any shell or tentacle motif on the leftmost figure’s shoulder should not appear oversized or misplaced.
Question: Are the ocean creature motifs on the armor of the leftmost figure small, integrated, and positioned in a way that does not distort the armor’s form?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q7: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining consistent lighting direction from the sunset behind the figures, this question checks whether the shadows cast by the figures onto the rocks align with the sun’s position and whether the silhouettes are clean and uninterrupted.
Question: Do the shadows of the figures fall forward onto the rocks in alignment with the sun’s position behind them, and are the silhouettes sharp and unbroken?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
