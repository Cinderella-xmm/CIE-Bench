      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the tall white building into a towering automaton with a sleek, white, armored body and mechanical windows as apertures, this involves replacing the original architectural structure with a robotic form. The editing position is the central high-rise building in the background. The transformation must maintain structural coherence and avoid geometric distortions such as misaligned edges or unnatural scaling. The material appearance should reflect metallic or armored textures without introducing pixelation or texture repetition artifacts.",
      "question": "Does the transformed building retain consistent geometric proportions and smooth surface transitions, with no visible warping or broken edges in its armored body?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of converting the traditional Japanese roof into stylized shoulder pads embedded with intricate patterns, the editing target is the dark-tiled roof of the lower building. This change alters both shape and material, requiring that the new shoulder pad design maintains plausible symmetry and integration with the surrounding architecture. The pattern details must be clear and not blurred or distorted.",
      "question": "Are the stylized shoulder pads seamlessly integrated into the roofline, with clean, sharp edges and coherent patterns that do not appear stretched or fragmented?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing traffic signs with holographic symbols, the editing positions include the red triangular \"STOP\" sign and the blue pedestrian crossing sign. Holographic elements must appear translucent or glowing without disrupting the surrounding environmentâ€™s lighting consistency. They should not introduce halos, color bleeding, or visual noise.",
      "question": "Do the replaced traffic signs display clear holographic effects (e.g., soft glow, transparency) without causing light leaks or unnatural color shifts in adjacent areas?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of altering the streetscape by integrating robotic pedestrians with geometric designs, the editing targets are the two people walking near the crosswalk. Their bodies must be modified to feature angular, mechanical limbs and surfaces while preserving human-like proportions and motion. The number of fingers and limb articulation must remain anatomically plausible.",
      "question": "Do the robotic pedestrians have correctly proportioned limbs with five fingers per hand, and do their joints and body shapes follow geometric logic without unnatural bending or missing segments?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining overall authenticity and natural appearance despite extensive edits, the entire scene must retain spatial depth and lighting consistency. The interaction between shadows, highlights, and materials across the automaton, robotic figures, and remaining structures must be harmonious. Any mismatch in shadow direction or material reflection would break visual credibility.",
      "question": "Are shadows cast by the robotic pedestrians and the transformed building consistent with the direction of sunlight from the top-left, and do they align naturally with surrounding objects?",
