Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction involves transforming the Hagia Sophia into a fantastical creature, which includes significant structural modifications to its domes, minarets, and central dome. The original image shows a historically accurate architectural structure with clearly defined geometric forms: a large central dome, four minarets (two on each side), semi-domes, and surrounding buildings. The transformation requires morphing these real-world architectural elements into biological and mechanical features (wings, legs, glowing patterns, jewel). This introduces multiple perceptual quality challenges related to realism, material consistency, structural coherence, and artifact avoidance. Specific sub-requirements must address whether the transformed parts maintain plausible geometry, natural textures, and visual continuity with the original structure, while avoiding distortions or unnatural transitions.

-Sub requirement 1: The metallic domes forming wings must retain consistent metallic texture and reflectivity across their surfaces, and their shape must conform to plausible wing-like structures without breaking geometric integrity or introducing jagged edges or pixelation.
-Sub requirement 2: The minarets morphed into legs must preserve anatomical plausibility—such as joint-like bends, tapering proportions, and smooth surface continuity—without appearing stretched, misaligned, or disconnected from the main body.
-Sub requirement 3: The replacement of the central dome with a large jewel must ensure that the new element integrates seamlessly in scale and lighting, reflecting cosmic patterns without violating physical laws (e.g., unrealistic refraction, floating appearance, or mismatched shadows).
-Sub requirement 4: The addition of glowing Byzantine patterns must not obscure architectural details or introduce unnatural luminosity that contradicts ambient lighting, and should follow existing ornamental motifs without distorting underlying surfaces.
-Sub requirement 5: All edited areas must avoid visible artifacts such as blurring, color bleeding, seam lines, or inconsistent shading that would indicate digital manipulation or low-resolution synthesis.

Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that metallic domes forming wings must retain consistent metallic texture and reflectivity, this question evaluates whether the wing-like structures have uniform surface properties and realistic reflections. The original domes are made of stone or tile materials; transforming them into metallic wings risks introducing unnatural sheen or texture mismatches. The question focuses on detecting visual artifacts like uneven glossiness, patchy textures, or inconsistent highlights.
Question: Do the metallic wing structures exhibit uniform reflective properties and smooth surface transitions without visible seams or texture repetition?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that minarets transformed into legs must maintain anatomical plausibility, this question checks if the leg-like extensions from the original minarets follow logical proportions and structural continuity. The original minarets are tall, slender, and tapered; converting them into legs requires preserving similar tapering but adding joints and curvature. Any distortion in length, angle, or thickness could break visual credibility.
Question: Are the leg-like structures derived from the minarets proportionally consistent with the rest of the structure and do they show natural curvature and joint-like articulation without stretching or warping?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that the central dome is replaced with a large jewel reflecting cosmic wonders, this question assesses whether the new element integrates naturally in terms of scale, lighting, and reflection. The original dome has a dome-shaped roof with a golden finial; replacing it with a jewel must avoid floating or detached appearance, and reflections should match the surrounding environment’s light source.
Question: Does the central jewel reflect light and cosmic patterns in a way that matches the direction of sunlight and surrounding environment, without appearing to float or casting inconsistent shadows?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that glowing Byzantine patterns must not distort underlying architecture or introduce unnatural luminosity, this question evaluates whether the added glowing designs follow the contours of the building and respect the original lighting conditions. Glowing elements should not override surface details or create false depth through over-brightening.
Question: Are the glowing patterns confined to surface-level details, following architectural lines, and do they emit light that blends with ambient illumination without creating harsh glows or obscuring textures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that all edited areas must avoid visible artifacts such as blurring or seam lines, this question checks for signs of digital manipulation at the boundaries between original and modified regions. Especially around the transition zones between domes, minarets, and newly added features, there may be visible edges, ghosting, or loss of detail.
Question: Are there any visible seams, blurring, or color discontinuities at the junctions between the original building and the transformed elements such as wings, legs, or jewel?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
