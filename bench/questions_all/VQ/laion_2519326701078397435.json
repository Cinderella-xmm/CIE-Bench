      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the hair into cogwheel curls, this edit affects the top of the head where the original curly hair is located. The transformation must preserve the volume and flow of the original hairstyle while replacing each curl with a gear-like structure. Any distortion in the skull shape, misalignment of the curls, or loss of detail would compromise realism and structural consistency.",
      "question": "Are the cogwheel curls integrated into the hairline without distorting the shape of the head or breaking the continuity of the scalp surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the drapery with metallic fabrics featuring rivets and tubes, this edit targets the shoulder and chest area. The original fabric folds must be preserved in form but replaced with metal textures. The new material should follow the same drape and tension as the original, with visible rivets and tubing that align with the underlying anatomy.",
      "question": "Do the metallic fabric folds follow the natural contours of the shoulders and chest without unnatural stretching or buckling, and are the rivets and tubes placed in physically plausible locations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adorning the base with vintage watch parts and gears, this edit affects the pedestal beneath the bust. The original simple cylindrical base must now include mechanical components such as gears, springs, or clockwork elements. These additions must be proportionally accurate and attached in a way that does not destabilize the structure or break the symmetry.",
      "question": "Are the watch parts and gears attached to the base in a stable and symmetrical arrangement without overlapping or floating elements that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a monocle mechanism to the eye area, this edit focuses on the right eye socket (as seen in profile). The monocle must appear as a functional mechanical device, possibly with lenses, hinges, or wires, and should be positioned so it does not distort the facial structure or occlude the nose or cheekbone.",
      "question": "Is the monocle mechanism positioned flush with the eye socket and connected to the face via visible but plausible mechanical joints, without altering the shape of the surrounding facial bones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining a polished bronze and copper color scheme, this edit applies to all modified surfacesâ€”the hair, drapery, base, and monocle. The color transitions must be consistent, with appropriate highlights and shadows to simulate metallic sheen. Inconsistent shading or mismatched hues would create an artificial appearance.",
      "question": "Are the bronze and copper tones uniformly applied across all modified elements, with realistic reflections and no abrupt color boundaries or flat, non-metallic areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
