The character’s pose and facial expression must remain unchanged. The battlefield scene should maintain a natural appearance and avoid introducing unnatural textures.",

      "thinking_process": "To maintain structural coherence and visual plausibility, the character's pose and facial expression should remain consistent with the original while the background changes. The transition between the character and the new background needs to be smooth and undistorted.",
