      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the handbag into a human figure while preserving the black leather texture and gold hardware, this question evaluates whether the skin or clothing surface of the model accurately reflects the original pebbled leather texture of the bag. The goal is to ensure that the material transition from object to person maintains visual consistency without introducing unnatural patterns or smoothing out texture details.",
      "question": "Does the surface of the model’s dress retain the same pebbled leather texture as the original handbag, with no visible smoothing, blurring, or texture repetition artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the handbag’s body with a black dress that mimics its shape and texture, this question checks whether the silhouette of the dress follows the original bag’s curves and volume without geometric distortion. The focus is on structural coherence—whether the dress appears physically plausible as worn clothing rather than a flattened or stretched version of the bag.",
      "question": "Is the shape of the dress consistent with the original handbag’s contours, especially around the base and shoulder area, without unnatural bulges, pinching, or loss of dimensionality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding gold jewelry matching the bag’s hardware, this question assesses whether the accessories (such as earrings, necklace, or bracelet) are proportionally sized relative to the model and placed in anatomically correct positions. It also checks for any floating or detached elements that would break realism.",
      "question": "Are the gold accessories positioned naturally on the model’s body, with proper alignment and scale relative to the face and limbs, and do they appear anchored without floating or clipping through skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of attaching the MK logo charm as a brooch, this question evaluates whether the placement of the circular MK emblem on the dress matches the original position on the bag (near the lower right side) and whether it remains intact in shape and detail. It ensures that the logo is not distorted, pixelated, or misaligned due to the transformation.",
      "question": "Is the MK logo charm clearly visible on the dress, maintaining its original circular shape and gold finish, without warping, stretching, or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of creating a luxurious runway scene with celebrity photographers, this question examines the background composition for depth, lighting consistency, and spatial logic. It checks whether the model casts appropriate shadows, whether the camera angles suggest real photography activity, and whether the environment supports the narrative without visual breaks.",
      "question": "Do the background elements (runway, photographers, lights) align with the model’s position in terms of perspective, shadow direction, and depth of field, without overlapping or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining a tall, narrow aspect ratio, this question verifies that the overall composition fits the intended format without forced cropping, stretching, or content truncation. It ensures that all key elements (model, text, background) are fully visible and proportionally balanced.",
      "question": "Is the entire model, text, and background contained within the vertical frame without any cut-off limbs, text, or objects, and is the layout vertically balanced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating the text “Strut the City Streets” in a serif font, this question checks whether the typography is rendered cleanly, legibly, and without distortion. It ensures that the text does not interfere with the model or other elements and is properly spaced.",
      "question": "Is the text “Strut the City Streets” displayed in a clear serif font at the top of the image, without blurring, aliasing, or overlap with the model or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
