Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction requires miniaturizing the entire architectural ensemble (including the turquoise dome, minaret, ornate arches, and surrounding structures) into a 3D model inside a ceramic globe. This involves significant spatial transformation and recontextualization of the original scene. The original image contains a large mosque complex with a prominent blue-tiled dome, a tall cylindrical minaret with geometric patterns, and detailed tilework on the façade. These elements must be preserved in scale and style within the new context of a miniature globe. The addition of interior elements like palm trees and cobblestone paths introduces new objects not present in the original, which must be seamlessly integrated. The exterior of the globe is to be decorated with Persian patterns, requiring texture and design consistency with the architectural style. Therefore, key perceptual quality concerns include: whether the scaling and containment within the globe preserve structural coherence; whether the added interior elements (trees, path) appear physically plausible and proportionally correct; whether the materials (ceramic, tiles, stone) maintain realistic textures; whether the lighting and shadows are consistent across all elements; and whether any artifacts such as edge distortions or unnatural blending occur due to the composite nature of the edit.

-Sub requirement 1: The architectural ensemble (dome, minaret, arches, walls) must be scaled down and placed inside a ceramic globe without distorting their proportions or geometric integrity, ensuring structural consistency and visual plausibility.
-Sub requirement 2: The interior of the globe must contain miniature palm trees and a cobblestone path leading to the entrance, with natural-looking textures, correct scale relative to the architecture, and no floating or misaligned elements.
-Sub requirement 3: The exterior of the ceramic globe must display intricate Persian patterns that match the aesthetic of the original building’s tilework, with seamless tiling and no visible seams or repetition artifacts.
-Sub requirement 4: Golden highlights must be added to the dome and arches in a way that enhances realism without appearing overdrawn or artificial, maintaining material authenticity.
-Sub requirement 5: The transition between the interior scene (architecture and landscape) and the glass-like surface of the globe must be smooth, with no visible warping, distortion, or mismatched reflections, preserving depth and clarity.
-Sub requirement 6: The overall composition must maintain visual credibility by ensuring that the globe appears solid and three-dimensional, with proper lighting, shadowing, and perspective, avoiding flat or unnatural rendering.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that the architectural ensemble must be scaled down and placed inside a ceramic globe without distorting proportions or geometry, this question evaluates whether the dome, minaret, and arches retain their original shapes and spatial relationships when miniaturized. Any stretching, squashing, or angular inconsistencies would compromise structural coherence.
Question: Are the dome, minaret, and arches inside the globe proportionally accurate and geometrically intact, with no warped edges or broken lines?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that the interior includes miniature palm trees and a cobblestone path, this question checks if these newly added elements are correctly scaled relative to the architecture and placed logically. The trees should not appear oversized or misplaced, and the path should follow a natural trajectory toward the entrance.
Question: Do the palm trees and cobblestone path inside the globe appear at a consistent scale with the architecture and follow a plausible layout leading to the entrance?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that the exterior of the globe features intricate Persian patterns matching the original tilework, this question assesses whether the patterns are continuous, non-repeating, and stylistically coherent with the original building’s design. Artifacts such as tile seams, color mismatches, or abrupt pattern breaks would indicate poor integration.
Question: Are the Persian patterns on the exterior of the globe continuous, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the tilework seen on the original building?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that golden highlights are added to the dome and arches, this question examines whether the gold accents are applied naturally—such as along ridges or edges—without appearing as flat overlays or digital brush strokes. Realistic metallic sheen and subtle reflectivity should be present.
Question: Are the golden highlights on the dome and arches applied in a way that follows natural light interaction, with no flat, overly bright, or artificially drawn lines?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement that the transition between the interior scene and the globe’s surface must be smooth and free of distortion, this question checks for visual artifacts such as edge blurring, pixelation, or incorrect refraction effects that might suggest a poorly rendered glass or transparent boundary.
Question: Is the boundary between the interior scene and the globe’s surface clean and free of jagged edges, transparency glitches, or unnatural reflections?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
