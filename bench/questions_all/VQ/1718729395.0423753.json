      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the image into a classical Baroque painting style, this involves altering the overall visual texture, lighting, and color palette. The original image features soft, naturalistic lighting and delicate textures. The editing must maintain structural coherence in the figure’s proportions and facial features while introducing rich, dramatic textures typical of Baroque art. Therefore, the question evaluates whether the transformation preserves the natural appearance of the face and skin tone without introducing unnatural color shifts or texture distortions.",
      "question": "Does the angel's facial skin retain smooth, consistent texture and natural coloration without artificial halos, pixelation, or unnatural highlights?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies enhancing the angelic figure with dramatic ornate garments featuring rich textures and deep colors. In the original image, the figure wears a simple white garment. The addition of ornate fabric must not disrupt the anatomical structure of the body or introduce physically implausible folds or material properties. This question assesses whether the new garment maintains plausible fabric behavior and integration with the body.",
      "question": "Are the added ornate garments visually integrated with the figure’s body, showing realistic draping, fold depth, and material consistency without floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires adding gold accents to the wings, emphasizing their feathery detail. The original wings are white and softly rendered. Introducing metallic gold elements must not obscure or distort the feather structure or create unnatural reflections that contradict the light source. This question checks if the gold accents enhance rather than degrade the realism of the wing texture.",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the wings appear as subtle, layered highlights that follow the natural curvature of the feathers without creating sharp, unnatural glares or breaking feather edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The background is to be replaced with an opulent celestial scene filled with soft clouds and distant stars, using a warm, harmonious palette. The original background is neutral and diffuse. Replacing it must ensure that the new celestial elements do not clash with the lighting direction or scale of the figure. The transition between the figure and the new background must be seamless and physically plausible.",
      "question": "Is the transition between the angel’s figure and the new celestial background smooth, with consistent lighting direction and no abrupt edges or mismatched depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The original image shows the angel’s hands gently touching her chest. The instruction does not specify changes to the hands, but any style transformation must preserve anatomical accuracy. This includes correct finger count, natural joint angles, and realistic skin texture. Any distortion here would compromise structural consistency.",
      "question": "Do the hands show five fingers each with natural joint alignment, proper shadowing, and skin texture without swelling, extra digits, or unnatural contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
