      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the comforter to resemble patchwork fur using the original colors, evaluate whether the texture and color transitions in the comforter appear natural and consistent with animal fur. Specifically, check if the individual colored sections (red, gray, white, navy blue) form cohesive patches without sharp, artificial seams or pixelation.",
      "question": "Are the color blocks on the comforter smoothly blended and textured to resemble natural fur, with no visible stitching artifacts or abrupt edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the pillows with alert ears trimmed with soft leaves, assess whether the ears are shaped plausibly (pointed, upright, symmetrical) and whether the leaf trim appears realistically attached to the ear tips. Focus on material continuity—whether the transition from fabric to foliage is seamless and visually coherent.",
      "question": "Do the ear-shaped pillows have a natural, upright shape with soft leaf trims that appear securely and organically attached without floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the bed frame with slender, branch-like legs, evaluate whether the new legs have an organic, naturalistic form resembling tree branches, and whether they are proportionally correct relative to the bed size. Check for structural integrity—do they appear capable of supporting the bed, and are they properly aligned with the mattress base?",
      "question": "Are the branch-like legs thin, curved, and textured like natural wood, and do they connect correctly to the bed base without appearing broken or disconnected?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a bushy, plush red tail extending from the bottom of the comforter, assess whether the tail has volume and softness consistent with animal fur, and whether it emerges naturally from the lower edge of the comforter without clipping through the fabric or appearing flat or rigid.",
      "question": "Does the red tail extend from the comforter with a rounded, fluffy shape and soft texture, and does it not intersect or clip through the fabric beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining overall realism and visual credibility, evaluate whether the lighting, shadows, and spatial relationships across all modified elements (ears, tail, legs, fur) are consistent with the original room environment. Check for mismatched shadows, unnatural highlights, or floating elements that break immersion.",
      "question": "Are the shadows and lighting on the ears, tail, and branch legs consistent with the ambient light source in the room and do they align with the original bed's position and surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
