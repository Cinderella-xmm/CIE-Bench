      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the dark suit jacket with a floral-patterned design while preserving its silhouette and structure, this question evaluates whether the new pattern is seamlessly integrated into the fabric without distorting the lapels, shoulders, or sleeves. It checks for unnatural texture repetition, mismatched shading, or broken edges along the suit’s outline.",
      "question": "Does the floral pattern on the suit jacket follow the contours of the lapels and shoulders without visible distortion or misalignment?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the monochrome bow tie with a bold graphic design using vivid colors and geometric shapes, this question assesses whether the new bow tie maintains its original shape and knot structure. It checks for proper alignment with the shirt collar and absence of jagged edges or unnatural color transitions.",
      "question": "Is the geometric design on the bow tie aligned symmetrically and properly tied under the collar without breaking the knot shape or introducing sharp, artificial edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying a dotted texture to the background for contrast, this question evaluates whether the texture is uniformly distributed and does not interfere with the subject’s visibility. It checks for consistent dot size, spacing, and opacity across the background.",
      "question": "Is the dotted texture in the background evenly spaced and consistent in size and density throughout, without overlapping or obscuring the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural coherence during the pop art-style transformation, this question examines whether the man’s facial features, head shape, and posture remain proportionally accurate and undistorted. It focuses on the alignment of facial features and the naturalness of skin texture.",
      "question": "Are the facial features, including the eyes, nose, and mouth, proportionally correct and undistorted, with natural skin texture and shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of ensuring natural material appearance for the newly introduced floral suit and graphic bow tie, this question checks whether the lighting and shadows on these elements match the rest of the scene. It evaluates whether the materials appear to reflect light consistently with the original image’s lighting direction and intensity.",
      "question": "Do the floral suit and graphic bow tie exhibit consistent lighting and shadowing relative to the shirt and background, without unnatural highlights or flat areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
