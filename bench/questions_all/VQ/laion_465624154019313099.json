      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the cake into a lively cake creature with expressive eyes atop its strawberry hat, evaluate whether the addition of eyes and facial features on the cake maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility. The original image shows a rectangular cake with a grid of meringue-like domes on top, and strawberries at the center. Adding eyes must not distort the existing geometric structure of the cake’s surface or create unnatural textures in the meringue domes.",
      "question": "Are the eyes added to the cake positioned naturally on the surface without distorting the shape or texture of the meringue domes?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of placing expressive eyes atop the strawberry hat, assess whether the strawberries used as a hat maintain their natural form and position relative to the cake's surface. The original image shows two strawberries placed centrally on top of the cake. Editing must ensure that the strawberries are not deformed or unnaturally resized when used as a hat element.",
      "question": "Do the strawberries retain their original shape and size when repurposed as a hat, without any visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a comic-style dialogue and background elements such as silhouettes of utensils, evaluate whether these additions introduce artifacts or affect the realism of the cake’s surrounding environment. The original image has a dark background with no visible utensils. Any added silhouettes must be faint and non-intrusive, preserving the depth and lighting consistency.",
      "question": "Are the faint silhouettes of utensils in the background visually consistent with the lighting and depth of the scene, without introducing harsh edges or unnatural shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of depicting the cake creature in a heroic pose with strawberries as bodyguards and garnishes forming a shield, assess whether the placement of these elements adheres to physical logic and spatial coherence. The original cake has a clean rectangular base with crumbled nuts around it. Adding bodyguards and shields must not disrupt the base structure or cause overlapping inconsistencies.",
      "question": "Are the strawberries and garnishes arranged around the cake in a way that maintains structural balance and does not overlap or distort the cake’s base or side layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of showing the cake creature shaking its head in a determined pose, evaluate whether the motion implied by the pose is physically plausible given the cake’s rigid structure. The original cake has a solid, fixed form. Any animation or movement suggestion must not imply bending or deformation of the cake’s body.",
      "question": "Does the depiction of the cake shaking its head maintain the rigidity of the cake’s structure without suggesting unnatural flexing or bending of the layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
