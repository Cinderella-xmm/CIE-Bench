Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "adding and modifying elements to transform the vase into a structure made entirely of flowers, ensuring it maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility", judge whether the transformation at this position avoids introducing unnatural textures or loss of details.
Question: Are there any unnatural textures or missing details where the vase is replaced with floral elements?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: No

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of "maintaining the overall sense of reality and natural appearance when blending elaborate floral details with the form of the vase", evaluate if the proportions and physical rationality of each element avoid distortion such as damaged geometric shapes.
Question: Do the floral elements replacing the vase maintain proper proportions and avoid distorted geometric shapes?
Choices: yes, no  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: According to the sub requirement of "ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility while transforming the vase into a floral design", assess if the new floral structure retains the core element's integrity and blends harmoniously with the original vase shape.
Question: Does the floral transformation retain structural consistency and blend naturally with the original vase shape?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Focusing on the sub requirement of "avoiding obvious artifacts and maintaining fine details during the imaginative design process", check if the transition between the vase and floral elements appears seamless without visible artifacts.
Question: Is the transition between the vase and floral elements seamless without visible artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Given the sub requirement of "ensuring the composition and layout of the floral vase have visual credibility and do not introduce distortions", verify if the arrangement of flowers in the vase-like structure looks plausible and natural.
Question: Does the arrangement of flowers in the vase-like structure appear natural and visually credible?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
