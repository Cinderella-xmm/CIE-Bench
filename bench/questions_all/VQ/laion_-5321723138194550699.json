Any jaggedness, misalignment, or clipping would indicate poor rendering quality.",
      "question": "Are the black ink outlines around the car's body, wheels, and wing consistently sharp and aligned with the underlying shapes without breaking or overlapping?",

      "question": "Do the halftone dots on the car’s side panels and wing appear evenly spaced and consistent in density without visible banding or irregular clustering?",

      "question": "Are the dominant colors on the car (such as the wing and side panels) now rendered in muted orange, cream, and deep gray without any residual bright or unnatural hues?",

      "question": "Has the background behind the car been simplified into flat or textured blocks without retaining detailed figures or structures that conflict with the comic style?",
