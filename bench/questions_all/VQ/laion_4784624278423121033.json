      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the circular dough with a realistic atom illustration, this question evaluates whether the new atom illustration maintains structural consistency with the surrounding environment (wooden surface, cookie cutter) and appears naturally integrated without visible seams or texture mismatches. The atom must retain geometric integrity and align spatially with the original doughâ€™s position.",
      "question": "Is the atom illustration placed in the same location as the original dough and does it have a smooth, continuous edge without jagged lines or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding multiple colored atom-shaped cookies centered in the image, this question checks whether the newly added cookies are proportionally consistent with the original dough and do not appear oversized or distorted. It also evaluates whether their colors are harmonious with the natural tones of the scene.",
      "question": "Are the additional atom-shaped cookies the same size as the original dough and do they have colors that blend naturally with the beige dough and wooden background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding labeled arrows pointing to electrons, protons, and neutrons, this question assesses whether the arrows are correctly positioned relative to the atomic components and do not distort the underlying structure. It checks for proper alignment and absence of overlapping or misaligned labels.",
      "question": "Do the arrows point directly to the correct parts of the atom (electrons, protons, neutrons) without crossing over or distorting the atomic shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of inserting title text using a whimsical font, this question evaluates whether the font is legible, stylistically appropriate, and does not obscure any key visual elements such as the atom illustrations or cookie cutter. It also checks for proper placement within the image.",
      "question": "Is the title text \"Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry\" clearly visible, positioned above the illustrations, and does it not overlap with the atom shapes or cookie cutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding dotted lines to organize the layout, this question checks whether the lines are evenly spaced, consistent in style, and do not interfere with the visibility of the main elements. It ensures that the layout remains clean and structured without visual clutter.",
      "question": "Are the dotted lines straight, uniformly spaced, and positioned between sections without covering the atom illustrations or cookie cutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
