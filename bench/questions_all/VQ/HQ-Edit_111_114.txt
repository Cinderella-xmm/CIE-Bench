Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-<Thinking Process 1>: The editing instruction involves transforming the original realistic image into a vintage postcard series with cartoonized elements, sepia tones, faded edges, art-nouveau frames, textured parchment, and twine-bound sets. This requires significant stylization of the central figure (the man on the scooter), including exaggeration of form and details, color transformation to sepia, edge degradation, addition of ornate framing, blank writing space, texture simulation, and arrangement in a bound set. Each of these changes affects perceptual quality by altering realism, introducing stylistic distortions, and modifying material appearance. The core elements—such as the man, scooter, buildings, and background figures—must retain structural coherence despite stylization. Attention must be paid to whether exaggerated proportions distort geometry, whether textures appear artificial, whether added frames interfere with spatial logic, and whether the overall composition maintains visual credibility under the new aesthetic.

-Sub requirement 1: Cartoonizing the man and scooter with exaggerated details must preserve structural consistency and avoid geometric distortion, particularly in limbs, facial features, and scooter components.
-Sub requirement 2: Applying sepia tones across the entire image must not introduce unnatural color gradients or loss of fine detail, especially in textures like clothing, building facades, and cobblestone streets.
-Sub requirement 3: Faded edges must be applied uniformly without creating abrupt transitions or visible digital artifacts that break continuity.
-Sub requirement 4: Adding art-nouveau style frames must not overlap or obscure key elements such as the man’s face, scooter, or background architecture, and must integrate naturally with the image’s borders.
-Sub requirement 5: Introducing a blank writing space beneath the image must not disrupt the layout or cause misalignment of the central subject.
-Sub requirement 6: Rendering the image on textured parchment must simulate natural paper grain without causing blurring or obscuring critical details.
-Sub requirement 7: Arranging multiple postcards in twine-bound sets must maintain consistent perspective and avoid unrealistic stacking or shadowing that contradicts physical plausibility.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of cartoonizing the man and scooter with exaggerated details while preserving structural consistency, this question evaluates whether the proportions of the man's body (especially limbs and head) and the scooter (e.g., handlebars, wheels, fenders) remain within plausible geometric bounds despite stylization. Exaggeration should not result in bent limbs, misshapen joints, or distorted vehicle parts.
Question: Are the limbs of the man and the components of the scooter proportionally coherent and free from geometric distortion such as elongated arms, bent knees, or misaligned wheels?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of applying sepia tones across the image, this question assesses whether the color transformation is uniform and preserves fine details in high-texture areas such as the man’s shirt, the scooter’s surface, and the cobblestone street. Sepia rendering should not cause pixelation, banding, or loss of contrast in shaded regions.
Question: Do the sepia tones cover all areas evenly without visible color banding, blotchy patches, or loss of detail in textures like fabric, stone, or foliage?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding faded edges, this question checks whether the fading effect is smooth and gradual along the image perimeter, without sharp cutoffs, jagged lines, or digital artifacts that suggest poor blending. The fade should not interrupt the continuity of architectural elements or the man’s figure at the borders.
Question: Are the edges of the image softly degraded with a smooth transition into white, without abrupt lines or visible masking artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding art-nouveau style frames, this question evaluates whether the frame design integrates naturally with the image’s border without overlapping critical content such as the man’s hat, the scooter’s front light, or the background archways. The frame should not distort the underlying image or create depth conflicts.
Question: Does the art-nouveau frame surround the image without overlapping or cutting through the man’s face, scooter, or any background structures?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding a blank writing space beneath the image, this question checks whether the space is positioned consistently below the main scene and does not shift or distort the alignment of the central figure or scooter. The space should be rectangular and unobtrusive.
Question: Is the blank writing area located directly beneath the image, aligned horizontally, and free from warping or interference with the scooter’s base or ground line?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q6: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of rendering on textured parchment, this question evaluates whether the simulated paper texture overlays the image evenly without obscuring important details such as facial features, text on the scooter, or architectural patterns. The texture should not appear layered or artificially imposed.
Question: Does the parchment texture appear uniformly across the image without causing blurring, ghosting, or obscuration of fine details like the man’s beard or window shutters?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q7: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of arranging postcards in twine-bound sets, this question assesses whether the multiple postcards are stacked in a physically plausible manner with consistent shadows, perspective, and spacing. The twine binding should not appear floating or disconnected from the cards.
Question: Are the postcards arranged in a stack with realistic shadows, overlapping edges, and twine wrapped around them in a way that suggests physical binding?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
