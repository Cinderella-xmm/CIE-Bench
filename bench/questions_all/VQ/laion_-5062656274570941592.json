      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the wooden structure with an ornate marble grotto, evaluate whether the new material (marble) appears consistent in texture and finish across the entire structure, particularly in areas such as the roof, walls, and base. The original image features a wooden stable with visible grain patterns and layered construction. The replacement must maintain structural coherence and avoid unnatural textures or inconsistent surface details.",
      "question": "Does the marble grotto structure exhibit uniform stone-like texture and natural veining throughout, without artificial-looking smoothness or irregular patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of crafting figures in fine porcelain with a glossy finish, assess the appearance of the figurines—specifically Mary, Joseph, baby Jesus, the sheep, and the donkey—within the scene. These figures originally appear as flat, laser-cut wooden silhouettes. The conversion to porcelain should preserve their proportions and poses while introducing a reflective, polished surface that does not distort shapes or introduce warping.",
      "question": "Do the porcelain figurines retain accurate anatomical proportions and facial features without deformation, and do they display a consistent glossy finish across all surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding intricate gold leaf elaborations to garments and halos, evaluate whether the gold accents are applied only to designated areas such as the halos around Mary and Joseph, the edges of robes, and the crown over baby Jesus. The gold should be thin, delicate, and integrated seamlessly into the porcelain surface without appearing thick, clumpy, or misaligned.",
      "question": "Are the gold leaf details confined to garment edges and halos, applied evenly and without overlapping or smudging, and do they reflect light naturally without creating harsh highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding luxurious packaging with velvet lining and elegant branding on the box's exterior, assess whether the outer box is present and visually distinct from the nativity scene itself. It should include a visible branded label and soft-textured interior lining. This addition must not obscure or distort the main scene and must appear physically plausible in size and placement relative to the figurines.",
      "question": "Is the packaging clearly visible surrounding the figurine set, featuring a branded exterior and dark velvet lining that supports the figures without compressing or distorting them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility when replacing the wooden stable with a marble grotto, evaluate whether the architectural elements—such as columns, arches, and base—are geometrically sound and proportionally aligned with the figurines inside. Any distortion in angles or scaling would compromise realism.",
      "question": "Are the columns and arches of the marble grotto properly scaled and aligned with the figurines, maintaining correct perspective and avoiding skewed angles or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
