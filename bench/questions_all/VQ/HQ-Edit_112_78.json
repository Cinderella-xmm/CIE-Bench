      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the teapot's body with a glass container featuring embossed patterns, this question evaluates whether the new material (glass) appears natural in terms of transparency, surface texture, and light interaction. The original metallic body had high reflectivity and sharp edges; the glass version must show appropriate refraction and subtle embossing without unnatural distortions such as warped patterns or inconsistent transparency.",
      "question": "Does the glass container display natural transparency with visible embossed patterns that do not appear distorted or unnaturally stretched?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of modifying the lid into a decorative finial-style candle snuffer, this question checks whether the new top structure maintains proportional alignment and structural coherence with the body. The finial should extend naturally from the lid and not appear oversized, misaligned, or detached from the containerâ€™s silhouette.",
      "question": "Is the candle snuffer finial proportionally aligned with the glass container and structurally connected without gaps or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the lace-covered pedestal with a marble base, this question evaluates whether the new surface exhibits natural marble characteristics such as veining, polish, and reflectivity. The original lace had soft folds and texture; the marble must lack any residual textile pattern and instead show smooth, continuous stone texture with realistic light reflection.",
      "question": "Does the marble base show consistent veining and reflective surface without any remnants of lace texture or unnatural seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a nameplate reading \"Elegance Aroma\" on the side of the container, this question assesses whether the label is correctly positioned, sized, and integrated into the scene. It must not float, clip through the container, or appear disproportionately large or small relative to the object.",
      "question": "Is the nameplate attached to the side of the container at a natural height and angle, with no floating or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining consistent lighting and material behavior across all elements, this question evaluates whether reflections, shadows, and highlights on the glass, marble, and finial respond realistically to the directional light source. For example, the glass should reflect the environment and cast soft shadows, while the marble should reflect light smoothly without abrupt transitions.",
      "question": "Do the reflections and shadows on the glass container, marble base, and finial align with the direction of the light source and exhibit consistent material behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
