Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the woman into a stylized Art Nouveau-inspired fridge magnet while retaining the flowing dress with detailed fabric folds in pastel hues, evaluate whether the material and texture of the dress in the edited image maintain natural appearance and structural coherence. The original image shows a soft, draped gown with realistic fabric folds and subtle shading; any conversion to a magnet format must preserve these details without introducing artificial textures or distortions.
Question: Are the fabric folds of the woman's dress clearly defined and consistent with natural draping behavior, without unnatural smoothing or pixelation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining the ornate background with floral motifs and gentle arch designs, assess whether the background elements retain their intricate patterns and visual integrity after editing. The original image features an arched stained-glass window with organic, swirling Art Nouveau designs—any modification must not disrupt geometric continuity or introduce broken lines or misaligned patterns.
Question: Do the floral and curvilinear motifs in the background remain continuous and symmetrical, with no visible breaks or misalignments in the decorative framework?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding gold trimming along the edges of the magnet, evaluate whether the added metallic border is seamlessly integrated and visually plausible. The trim should follow the contour of the image edge without overlapping content unnaturally or appearing as a flat, untextured overlay that contradicts lighting and depth cues.
Question: Is the gold trim along the perimeter of the image evenly applied, with consistent thickness and reflective properties that match the surrounding lighting?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of preserving the woman’s pose and proportions during style conversion, assess whether her figure remains anatomically accurate and undistorted. The original image depicts a standing woman with natural posture and hand placement; any transformation into a magnet format must not alter limb proportions or introduce floating limbs or incorrect joint angles.
Question: Does the woman’s right hand maintain a natural position with five fingers properly aligned and no deformation or extra digits?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining a cohesive color palette mirroring the serene surroundings, evaluate whether the overall color balance across the image remains harmonious and consistent. The original image uses soft pastels and warm tones; any editing must avoid abrupt shifts in hue or saturation that would suggest digital artifacts or mismatched layers.
Question: Are the colors throughout the image uniformly balanced, with no sudden transitions or patches of unnatural saturation that suggest layering errors?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
