Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the iceberg-inspired ice tower into a pixelated structure with circuit-like textures, evaluate whether the material and surface texture of the tall glass on the right (originally filled with ice) have been altered to include pixelation and circuit patterns while maintaining structural coherence. The editing targets the shape, texture, and material of the ice-filled glass, which should now appear digitally rendered with geometric precision and technological motifs. This transformation must not introduce unnatural distortions or broken edges that compromise visual credibility.
Question: Does the tall glass on the right display consistent pixelated and circuit-like textures across its surface without visible cracks, jagged edges, or inconsistent rendering?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the Sydney Opera House into neon line art, assess whether the iconic building in the background has been stylized using glowing lines while preserving its recognizable silhouette and spatial relationship to the surrounding environment. The editing involves altering the architectural form’s material appearance from solid white shells to luminous outlines, which must remain geometrically accurate and proportionally aligned with the original structure.
Question: Are the outlines of the Sydney Opera House composed of continuous, evenly spaced neon lines that maintain the correct number and shape of the shell structures without misalignment or missing segments?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of replacing the ocean with geometric wave patterns, evaluate whether the water body between the foreground and the Opera House has been transformed into abstract, angular wave shapes rather than natural ripples. The editing affects the texture and motion representation of the water, requiring that the geometric patterns remain coherent and do not disrupt the horizon line or create floating inconsistencies.
Question: Do the wave patterns in the water consist of uniform, repeating geometric shapes that align horizontally and vertically without overlapping irregularly or creating gaps?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of rendering the frozen drink as a holographic element, assess whether the shorter glass on the left (containing the amber-colored beverage and ice cubes) now exhibits a translucent, layered, or refractive quality typical of holograms. The liquid and ice should appear semi-transparent with light interference effects, but the overall shape and internal composition must remain physically plausible.
Question: Does the beverage in the shorter glass show a consistent holographic effect with subtle layering and refraction, without distorting the shape of the ice cubes or causing unnatural transparency gradients?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of maintaining visual plausibility in the scene’s composition, evaluate whether the relative positions and lighting of all edited elements—the pixelated ice tower, neon Opera House, geometric ocean, and holographic drink—remain consistent with the original perspective and ambient lighting. The shadows, reflections, and depth cues must not contradict each other or suggest conflicting sources of illumination.
Question: Are the shadows cast by the two glasses aligned with the direction of the sunset lighting, and do they match the apparent position of the sun in the sky?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
