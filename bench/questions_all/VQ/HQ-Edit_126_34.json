      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying dappled brushstrokes and soft colors to the cabin structure, this question evaluates whether the transformation maintains the structural integrity of the cabin's geometry, particularly the triangular roof, log walls, and window placements. The focus is on whether the brushwork causes distortions such as misaligned logs, warped angles, or altered proportions.",
      "question": "Are the edges of the cabin’s roof, walls, and windows clearly defined and geometrically consistent, even with visible brushstrokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reimaging the fir trees with loose, vibrant strokes, this question checks whether the trees retain their natural conical shape and spatial arrangement around the cabin. It evaluates whether the Impressionist style leads to unnatural elongation, compression, or fragmentation of tree forms.",
      "question": "Do the surrounding fir trees maintain their vertical orientation and layered foliage structure despite the use of loose brushwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of rendering the chimney smoke as a gentle blur suggesting movement, this question assesses whether the smoke rises vertically from the chimney and disperses naturally in the air, avoiding abrupt cutoffs, unnatural curls, or static appearance that contradicts physics.",
      "question": "Does the smoke rise straight upward from the chimney and gradually blur outward, mimicking natural dispersion in cold air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of preserving natural snow appearance under Impressionist treatment, this question examines whether snow on the roof, ground, and trees appears consistently accumulated and textured, without floating clumps, uneven patches, or artificial-looking highlights.",
      "question": "Is the snow covering the roof, ground, and tree branches uniformly distributed and textured in a way that suggests natural accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating warm window glows and festive lights into the Impressionist style, this question checks whether the light sources remain coherent with the cabin’s architecture and do not appear overly sharp, pixelated, or disconnected from the surrounding brushwork.",
      "question": "Are the illuminated windows and string lights along the eaves softly blended into the scene, without harsh outlines or glowing halos that break the stylistic consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of maintaining visual credibility in composition and depth, this question evaluates whether the relative size and positioning of the cabin, nearby trees, and background forest create a believable sense of space and perspective, even with abstracted brushwork.",
      "question": "Do the foreground elements (small trees, fence) appear closer than the midground cabin and background trees, preserving depth and spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
