Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the soccer player into a charming chibi-style 3D figure while maintaining the soccer field, stadium, and cheering crowd realistic, we need to evaluate if the chibi figure blends naturally with the realistic environment.
Question: Does the chibi-style 3D soccer player appear to blend seamlessly with the realistic soccer field and stadium without any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Considering the sub requirement of keeping the soccer field, stadium, and cheering crowd realistic, we need to ensure that these elements retain their structural coherence and visual plausibility after the editing.
Question: Are the soccer field, stadium, and cheering crowd still visually plausible and structurally coherent, without any distortions or unnatural textures introduced by the editing?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement emphasizes avoiding distortion such as damaged geometric shapes and ensuring the proportion and physical rationality of each element. We need to assess if the chibi figure maintains proper proportions and physical logic.
Question: Does the chibi-style 3D soccer player maintain proper proportions and physical logic, avoiding any distorted or broken geometric shapes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement focuses on the maintained style, materials, and features reflecting the overall sense of reality and natural appearance. We need to evaluate if the materials and textures of the chibi figure look natural.
Question: Do the materials and textures of the chibi-style 3D soccer player look natural and free of any unnatural artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The sub requirement highlights the importance of retaining the core element to ensure structural consistency and visual credibility. We need to confirm if the action pose of the chibi figure is consistent with the original image.
Question: Is the action pose of the chibi-style 3D soccer player consistent with the original image, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
