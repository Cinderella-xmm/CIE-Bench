      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the naval ship (J244) into a mechanical model with brass finishes and rotating gears, this question evaluates whether the material change from gray steel to brass maintains natural appearance and structural consistency. The focus is on the hull, superstructure, and deck elements where brass components should logically integrate without distorting the original shape or introducing unnatural textures.",
      "question": "Are the brass finishes on the ship’s hull and superstructure smooth and consistent in texture, with no visible cracks, pixelation, or mismatched shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the human figures with metal automatons in Victorian attire, this question assesses whether the humanoid forms retain anatomical accuracy and appropriate material properties. The figures are located on the dock near the ship’s bow, and their limbs, joints, and clothing must appear mechanically plausible without deformation.",
      "question": "Do the metal automatons have five fingers per hand, properly articulated limbs, and clothing that conforms to the body shape without unnatural wrinkles or floating fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of enclosing the scene within a vintage glass lantern, this question checks the physical plausibility of the lantern structure. The lantern must frame the entire scene, including the ship, dock, and sky, with transparent glass panels and a metal frame that does not obscure key elements or introduce structural inconsistencies.",
      "question": "Is the glass lantern clearly defined around the scene, with transparent sides, visible metal framing, and no overlapping or missing sections that break the enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding floating steam clouds within the lantern, this question evaluates whether the steam appears volumetric and dynamically dispersed. Steam should be translucent, with soft edges and subtle gradients, avoiding sharp outlines or artificial patterns that suggest digital artifacting.",
      "question": "Are the steam clouds rendered with smooth gradients and soft edges, appearing to float naturally within the lantern without jagged borders or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of incorporating oversized compasses and maritime flags, this question examines whether these elements are proportionally scaled and positioned logically within the diorama. The compasses should be large enough to stand out but not obstruct the view, and the flags should hang from appropriate masts or poles without floating unnaturally.",
      "question": "Are the compasses and flags placed in logical positions relative to the ship and dock, with proper orientation and size that does not distort the spatial relationships between objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating mechanical details like gears and pipes into the ship’s structure, this question checks whether these elements are aligned with the original geometry and do not introduce floating or disconnected parts. Gears should appear functional and attached to visible shafts or housings.",
      "question": "Are the rotating gears and mechanical components attached to the ship’s structure with visible supports, and do they follow the contours of the hull and deck without floating or intersecting incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
