Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction involves transforming a wooden cabinet into an anthropomorphic character. This requires significant morphological changes across multiple components: the marble top (now a crown), the body (transformed into a robe), the drawers (becoming belt buckles), and the legs (changed into clawed feet). Each transformation must preserve structural coherence, material realism, and avoid distortions such as unnatural textures or geometric breaks. The original image features a semi-circular wooden cabinet with a marbled top, two curved drawers with brass inlays, and four tapered legs. These elements will be reinterpreted symbolically but must remain visually plausible after transformation.
-Sub requirement 1: Transforming the marble top into a royal crown with gemstone inlays—evaluate whether the new crown maintains the original shape's curvature and material consistency while introducing gemstones without creating unnatural texture mismatches or floating elements.
-Sub requirement 2: Converting the cabinet body into an ornate robe—assess whether the robe retains the cabinet’s overall silhouette and proportions, and whether the patterned surface mimics fabric folds and draping naturally without rigid or distorted geometry.
-Sub requirement 3: Repurposing the drawer engravings into elaborate belt buckles—check if the metallic details are preserved and repositioned realistically on the robe, maintaining scale and alignment with the newly formed waist area.
-Sub requirement 4: Turning the legs into regal, clawed feet—determine whether the transformation preserves leg length and joint structure, and whether the claws appear anatomically plausible and integrated with the lower body form.
-Sub requirement 5: Making the drawers function like pouches on adventurer attire—verify that the open drawers now resemble wearable pouches with realistic depth, stitching, and attachment points, avoiding floating or disconnected parts.
-Sub requirement 6: Ensuring all transformations maintain visual credibility through consistent lighting, shadowing, and material continuity across the entire figure, preventing abrupt transitions or artifacts.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the marble top into a royal crown with gemstone inlays, evaluate whether the crown maintains the original semi-circular shape and integrates gemstones seamlessly into the surface without introducing unnatural textures, floating stones, or color inconsistencies.
Question: Are the gemstone inlays embedded into the crown surface without visible gaps or floating elements, and does the crown retain the original curvature of the marble top?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of converting the cabinet body into an ornate robe, assess whether the robe follows the original cabinet’s side profile and curves, and whether the fabric-like patterns and folds appear natural and continuous without rigid edges or unnatural creases.
Question: Does the robe follow the original cabinet’s curved sides and tapering shape, and do the fabric folds and patterns flow naturally without sharp breaks or artificial lines?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of repurposing the drawer engravings into belt buckles, check whether the brass inlays have been repositioned at the waist level of the robe, maintaining their size and design integrity, and whether they appear attached to the robe with realistic hardware.
Question: Are the drawer engravings positioned at the waistline as belt buckles, aligned with the robe’s structure, and connected with visible straps or fastenings that appear physically plausible?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of turning the legs into clawed feet, evaluate whether the legs have been transformed into feet with claw-like toes that match the original leg length and thickness, and whether the claws are proportionally sized and grounded on the floor without floating.
Question: Do the clawed feet maintain the original leg length and thickness, and are the claws proportionally sized and fully touching the ground without appearing detached or misaligned?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of making the drawers function as pouches, verify that the open drawers now resemble wearable pouches with visible seams, flaps, and attachment points, and that they hang naturally from the robe without floating or distorting the surrounding fabric.
Question: Are the drawer openings transformed into pouches with visible flap closures and stitching, and do they hang from the robe with realistic weight and attachment points?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
