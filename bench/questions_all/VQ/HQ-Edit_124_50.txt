Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of transforming the painted horse into a whimsical 3D puzzle piece, evaluate whether the geometric structure of the horse has been logically segmented into interlocking puzzle sections while preserving its original shape and proportions. This involves checking if the segmentation follows natural contours and maintains structural coherence without introducing distorted or broken edges.
Question: Are the puzzle sections on the horseâ€™s body clearly defined with clean, interlocking edges that follow the natural curves of the horse's form?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of retaining the horse's intricate floral motifs while breaking them up into puzzle sections, assess whether the floral patterns remain continuous and visually coherent across the segmented surfaces. The goal is to ensure that the artistic design does not appear fragmented or disrupted in an unnatural way due to the puzzle division.
Question: Do the floral patterns on each puzzle section align seamlessly at the edges where pieces meet, maintaining visual continuity?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of enclosing the horse within a glass dome, evaluate whether the dome appears transparent, smooth, and physically plausible, with no visible distortions, reflections, or artifacts that suggest poor rendering. The dome should conform to typical optical properties of glass without warping the underlying image.
Question: Is the glass dome over the horse clear and free from unnatural distortions, smudges, or irregular reflections that would suggest poor material simulation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of anchoring the display case with a textured wooden base and adding a vintage compass motif, assess whether the base material appears consistent with real wood grain and texture, and whether the compass is proportionally accurate and integrated naturally into the base without floating or misalignment.
Question: Does the wooden base exhibit realistic wood grain and texture, and is the compass embedded in a way that matches the surface plane and scale of the base?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of adding antique-brass accents to complement the rustic aesthetic, evaluate whether the brass elements (such as hinges, trim, or fittings) have a natural metallic sheen, appropriate color tone, and correct physical placement relative to the wooden case and glass dome. These accents must avoid appearing flat, overly shiny, or misplaced.
Question: Are the antique-brass accents positioned logically on the frame and base, with a matte-to-slight-reflective finish consistent with aged metal?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
