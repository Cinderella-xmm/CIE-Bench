      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the guitar body into an armored torso while maintaining structural consistency, this question evaluates whether the overall shape of the guitar body has been preserved and whether any geometric distortion (such as warped curves or misaligned edges) occurred during the transformation.",
      "question": "Does the outline of the guitar body remain intact and undistorted after being converted into an armored torso?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of emphasizing the wood grain as a metallic, deep mahogany finish, this question checks whether the texture modification retains the natural pattern of the wood grain while introducing a metallic sheen without creating unnatural highlights, smudging, or texture repetition.",
      "question": "Is the metallic finish applied to the guitar body consistent with the original wood grain pattern, showing no signs of artificial texture tiling or unnatural reflections?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding dynamic illustrative lines, this question evaluates whether these lines are smoothly drawn, follow the contours of the guitar, and do not interfere with key features like the soundhole or bridge, ensuring they contribute to the comic style without breaking visual coherence.",
      "question": "Are the illustrative lines evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the guitar's curvature without overlapping or cutting through structural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of reinterpreting the guitar strings as muscle strands wrapping the body, this question assesses whether the string paths maintain logical tension and continuity, following the body’s surface without appearing disconnected or unnaturally bent.",
      "question": "Do the strings appear as continuous, taut muscle strands that follow the body’s contour without kinks, gaps, or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of drawing a luminous cape flowing from the neck with sound wave motifs, this question evaluates whether the cape’s shape and motion suggest natural flow, and whether the sound waves are properly rendered without distortion or misalignment.",
      "question": "Does the cape extend naturally from the neck, showing smooth folds and consistent sound wave patterns along its length without abrupt changes or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a bright emblem on the headstock, this question checks whether the emblem is clearly defined, proportionally sized, and positioned without obscuring the tuning pegs or brand logo, ensuring integration into the design.",
      "question": "Is the emblem on the headstock fully visible, correctly aligned, and not overlapping with the tuning pegs or brand name?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of avoiding artifacts such as jagged edges or color bleeding, this question evaluates the quality of blending between original and added elements, particularly at boundaries like the edge of the cape, the transition from strings to muscle strands, and around the soundhole.",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as pixelation, color bleeding, or sharp discontinuities at the junctions between original guitar parts and added elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
