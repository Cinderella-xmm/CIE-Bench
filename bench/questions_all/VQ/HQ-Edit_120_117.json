      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing the full scene with a globe enclosure, this question evaluates whether the spherical boundary of the globe is clearly defined and geometrically consistent, ensuring no stretching, tearing, or misaligned curvature that would compromise the perception of a solid glass-like sphere.",
      "question": "Is the outer surface of the globe smooth and uniformly curved without visible distortion or jagged edges?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of inserting a miniature 3D lighthouse model inside the globe, this question checks whether the scaled-down version of the lighthouse maintains correct proportions and architectural details such as windows, door, and lantern room, ensuring it does not appear stretched, compressed, or structurally broken.",
      "question": "Does the miniature lighthouse inside the globe have accurate window placements and structural symmetry matching the original lighthouse?",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of replacing natural waves with translucent blue resin, this question evaluates whether the wave forms appear fluid and transparent with internal light refraction effects typical of resin, and whether they lack sharp seams or pixelated textures indicating digital artifacts.",
      "question": "Are the waves made of translucent blue resin visually continuous with smooth surfaces and subtle internal reflections, showing no blocky or fragmented textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of adding a wooden base with an engraved compass rose, this question assesses whether the wood grain appears natural, the engraving lines are clean and evenly spaced, and the base supports the globe without floating or misalignment issues.",
      "question": "Is the wooden base flat and grounded beneath the globe, with visible wood grain and engraved lines that follow a consistent radial pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of integrating painted clouds and distant mountains into the globeâ€™s background, this question checks whether these elements are positioned behind the globe at a proper depth, with soft edges and atmospheric perspective, avoiding placement errors like appearing in front of or intersecting with the globe.",
      "question": "Are the painted clouds and distant mountains located behind the globe, creating a sense of depth without overlapping or intersecting with the globe's surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of applying earthy tones to rocks and vibrant blues to water, this question evaluates whether the color transitions between rock and water are natural, with no abrupt shifts or unnatural hues that suggest over-saturation or incorrect tinting.",
      "question": "Do the rocks display earthy brown and green tones while the water shows vibrant blue with gradient shading, maintaining color harmony across the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
