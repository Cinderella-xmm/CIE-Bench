Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
-Thinking process 1: The editing instruction requires transforming the kimono and fox mask ensemble into an Art Deco graphic style, which involves stylizing existing elements. This includes simplifying floral patterns into geometric motifs, emphasizing bold lines and symmetry, and using a specific color palette (deep reds, pale pinks, metallics). The original image features a detailed fox mask with naturalistic textures, painted facial markings, and a traditional kimono with realistic floral patterns. The transformation must preserve structural coherence while introducing stylized forms. Key areas to evaluate include the fox mask (especially ears, face structure, and texture), the kimonoâ€™s pattern and fabric appearance, and overall silhouette harmony. The challenge lies in maintaining visual credibility when converting organic shapes into geometric ones without introducing distortions or unnatural textures.
-Sub requirement 1: Transform the fox mask into a stylized Art Deco form with geometric shapes and bold lines, ensuring that the facial structure remains coherent and symmetrical, and that the transition from organic to geometric does not introduce distorted proportions or broken edges.
-Sub requirement 2: Simplify the floral patterns on the kimono into stylized, symmetrical motifs consistent with Art Deco design principles, avoiding loss of detail or unnatural texture transitions.
-Sub requirement 3: Apply a color palette of deep reds, pale pinks, and metallics across both the mask and kimono, ensuring color consistency and harmony without abrupt or artificial shifts.
-Sub requirement 4: Maintain the overall silhouette and composition of the figure, preserving structural integrity and visual balance despite stylistic changes.
-Sub requirement 5: Ensure that all modified elements (mask, kimono, patterns) exhibit smooth, continuous surfaces without visible artifacts such as jagged edges, pixelation, or texture misalignment.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Q1: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement to transform the fox mask into a stylized Art Deco form with geometric shapes and bold lines, this question evaluates whether the facial structure of the mask retains coherent proportions and symmetry after editing. Specifically, it checks if the eyes, nose, and mouth area maintain natural alignment and avoid distortion such as stretched or warped features, which could compromise visual credibility.
Question: Are the facial features of the fox mask (eyes, nose, mouth) aligned symmetrically and proportionally, without any stretched or deformed areas?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement to simplify floral patterns into stylized motifs, this question assesses whether the floral designs on the kimono have been converted into geometric, symmetrical patterns without losing structural clarity or introducing unnatural textures. It focuses on the pattern continuity and edge definition.
Question: Are the floral patterns on the kimono replaced with clean, geometric motifs that follow consistent lines and shapes, without blurred or fragmented edges?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement to apply a color palette of deep reds, pale pinks, and metallics, this question evaluates whether the colors are applied uniformly and harmoniously across both the mask and kimono, without abrupt transitions or unnatural color patches that would suggest poor blending or artifacting.
Question: Do the colors on the kimono and mask transition smoothly between deep reds, pale pinks, and metallic tones without visible color bleeding or inconsistent shading?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement to maintain overall silhouette and composition, this question checks whether the figure's posture and garment shape remain structurally consistent after editing. It ensures that the kimono drapes naturally and that no parts appear unnaturally flattened or distorted due to stylization.
Question: Does the kimono retain a natural drape and fold structure, with no unnatural flattening or stretching of fabric that would disrupt physical plausibility?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement to avoid artifacts such as jagged edges or texture misalignment, this question evaluates the surface quality of the edited mask and kimono. It checks for signs of digital artifacts like pixelation, seam breaks, or inconsistent material rendering that would indicate low perceptual quality.
Question: Are the surfaces of the fox mask and kimono free from jagged edges, pixelation, or texture seams that suggest incomplete rendering or editing errors?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
