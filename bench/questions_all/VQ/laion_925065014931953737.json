      "thinking_process": "Based on the sub requirement of transforming the character into a chibi-style fridge magnet with an oversized head and small, stubby limbs, this involves significant proportion modification. The original image shows a human-scale Superman with realistic proportions. The editing task requires altering the head-to-body ratio and limb size, which directly affects structural coherence and visual plausibility. We must assess whether the head is disproportionately large relative to the body, and if the limbs are excessively short and thick in a way that maintains cartoonish stylization without introducing geometric distortions or unnatural scaling artifacts.",
      "question": "Is the head of the character significantly larger than the body, with smooth, consistent scaling across facial features and neck, avoiding jagged edges or inconsistent proportions?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies adding exaggerated, simplified features with thick black outlines. This style change from a photorealistic suit to a stylized, outlined design affects material appearance and texture perception. The original suit has a textured, fabric-like surface with metallic sheen. The edited version should maintain recognizable elements like the \"S\" symbol but in a simplified form with bold lines. We need to verify whether the outline is uniformly thick, cleanly applied, and does not bleed into adjacent areas or disrupt underlying textures.",
      "question": "Are the black outlines around the character's body and costume elements consistently thick, clean, and free of smudging or irregularities that suggest poor rendering?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes maintaining the \"S\" symbol prominently on the chest with bright primary colors. In the original image, the \"S\" is detailed with red, gold, and textured shading. In the chibi version, it should remain identifiable but simplified. We must check if the symbol retains its iconic shape, uses vibrant red and yellow tones, and avoids color bleeding or pixelation that would compromise clarity.",
      "question": "Is the \"S\" symbol on the chest clearly visible, using bright red and yellow colors with no blurring, color distortion, or loss of definition at the edges?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for vibrant blues and reds in the costume, particularly in the suit and cape. The original image uses deep navy blue with subtle texture and a rich red cape. In the edited version, these colors should be saturated and consistent with the chibi aesthetic. We evaluate whether the color shift enhances vibrancy without introducing unnatural gradients, banding, or chromatic aberrations that could indicate poor color processing.",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies small, stubby limbs. The original image shows well-proportioned arms and legs with natural musculature. In the chibi version, limbs should be shortened and thickened, but still retain basic anatomical structure (e.g., correct number of fingers). We must verify that the hands have no more than five fingers, and that the limbs are not distorted beyond recognition—such as missing joints or stretched segments—while maintaining structural consistency.",
