      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the original scanner into a packaging design. This means the physical scanner should no longer be visible; instead, it should be replaced by a box-like structure that represents the product's packaging. The transformation must fully obscure the actual device and present it as a consumer-ready package.",
      "question": "Is the original scanner completely replaced by a box-shaped packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Metallic textures are explicitly required to give a high-tech feel. These should be visually evident through reflective surfaces, chrome-like finishes, or brushed metal patterns. Iridescent colors suggest shifting hues (like rainbow effects) under light, indicating advanced material properties.",
      "question": "Does the packaging feature visible metallic textures such as brushed metal, chrome, or reflective surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "An iridescent color scheme implies that the surface reflects multiple colors depending on viewing angle, commonly seen in holographic or pearlescent materials. This should be observable across the packaging surface.",
      "question": "Does the packaging exhibit an iridescent color effect with shifting hues across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "A holographic display showing the scanner in action is a key visual element. It should appear as a transparent or floating image on the front of the box, depicting the scanner operating, possibly with motion or light effects.",
      "question": "Is there a holographic display on the front of the packaging showing the scanner in operation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Grid lines mimicking data flow suggest thin, glowing, or etched lines resembling digital circuitry or network pathways. These should be integrated into the surface of the packaging, not just background elements.",
      "question": "Are there visible grid lines or circuit-like patterns across the surface of the packaging that resemble data flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Tech-themed icons and branding refer to symbols like Wi-Fi signals, cloud computing, AI chips, or abstract circuit logos. Branding should include stylized text or logos consistent with a futuristic tech brand.",
      "question": "Are there tech-themed icons (e.g., circuits, data streams, digital symbols) and modern branding elements visible on the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
