Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires replacing one book with a magnifying glass that casts a large shadow. This involves identifying a bookshelf location where a book has been removed and replaced by a magnifying glass object. The presence of a visible shadow extending from the magnifying glass is essential to satisfy the requirement. The shadow should be prominent and directional, indicating light source consistency.
Question: Is there a magnifying glass placed in the position of one book on a shelf, casting a noticeable shadow?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The ghostly outline of a detective in a trench coat must be superimposed onto the patterned curtain of the window. This requires detecting a translucent or faint silhouette figure wearing a trench coat, aligned with the decorative fabric design. The outline should not obscure the curtain pattern but blend into it as an ethereal overlay.
Question: Is there a faint, translucent outline of a detective wearing a trench coat visible on the window curtain pattern?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Deep sepia tones imply a color palette dominated by warm browns, yellows, and muted reds, with reduced contrast and desaturation to evoke age and mystery. This transformation should affect the entire image uniformly, including walls, furniture, books, and lighting, without losing detail.
Question: Has the overall color tone of the image been shifted to deep sepia, giving it a moody and aged appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The title "The Lost Legacy" must appear in a bold, serif font at the top of the image. The placement should be centered or balanced across the upper portion, not obstructing key visual elements like the window or ceiling. The typography should match the vintage aestheticâ€”classic, readable, and stylistically appropriate.
Question: Is the title "The Lost Legacy" displayed in a bold, serif font across the top of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The rich, intricate details of the original library scene (e.g., carved woodwork, stained glass, book spines, desk ornamentation) must remain intact and visible despite the edits. The added elements (magnifying glass, ghostly figure, title) should not obscure or distort these features. Visual harmony between new and old elements is required.
Question: Are the original intricate details such as the ornate ceiling, book spines, and desk carvings still clearly visible and preserved?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
