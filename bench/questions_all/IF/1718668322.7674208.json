      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the outfit into a sleek metal armor suit with chrome and titanium finishes. This implies visible reflective surfaces, industrial design elements, and a high-gloss metallic appearance. Chrome and titanium finishes are characterized by silver-gray tones with strong reflections and smooth textures. The question must verify if these material properties are present.",
      "question": "Does the outfit now feature a sleek metal armor suit with visible chrome and titanium finishes, including reflective surfaces and industrial design?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Articulated joints imply mechanical segmentation at key body points (shoulders, elbows, hips) to allow movement. These should be visibly distinct from solid panels, possibly with hinge-like structures or segmented plates. The question checks whether such functional joint details are included in the armor design.",
      "question": "Are there clearly defined articulated joints in the armor, such as at the shoulders, elbows, or hips, indicating flexibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires replacing the vibrant hair with flowing strands of polished wires in metallic blue and yellow hues. This means the hair must no longer appear organic but instead resemble thin, shiny, wire-like strands that reflect light and are colored in metallic blue and yellow tones. The question focuses on the material and color change.",
      "question": "Has the hair been replaced with flowing strands of polished wires in metallic blue and yellow hues, rather than natural-colored hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The background must be changed to a minimalist gray environment to provide contrast and emphasize the metallic materials. Minimalist implies clean lines, lack of clutter, and neutral tones—specifically gray. The question assesses whether this environmental change is implemented.",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned in a minimalist gray environment with no distracting elements or colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction implies preserving the original figure’s identity and pose while altering materials and surroundings. Therefore, the face, expression, and overall posture should remain unchanged despite the transformation of clothing and hair. The question ensures the core identity remains intact.",
      "question": "Has the figure’s facial features, expression, and overall posture remained consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
