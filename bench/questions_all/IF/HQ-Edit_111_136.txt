Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the woman into a figure from ancient Greek mythology. This implies a change in identity, attire, and aesthetic to align with known mythological figures such as a goddess or muse. The key observable feature is the shift from African cultural attire to classical Greek garments and appearance.
Question: Is the woman depicted in attire and form consistent with an ancient Greek mythological figure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states that the woman should wear a flowing white chiton with gold accents. A chiton is a characteristic garment of ancient Greece, typically draped and with defined folds. Gold accents would be visible as trim or decorative elements.
Question: Does the woman wear a flowing white garment resembling a chiton with visible gold accents?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction requires styling the hair into classical Greek waves adorned with laurel leaves. Classical Greek hairstyles often featured soft curls or waves, and laurel was a symbol of victory and divinity, commonly worn by gods and heroes.
Question: Is the woman's hair styled in soft, classical Greek waves and decorated with laurel leaves?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The original savannah scene must be transformed into a golden mythical landscape. This means replacing African flora and fauna with elements suggestive of myth—such as golden hues, fantastical terrain, and non-realistic vegetation.
Question: Has the background been changed to a golden-colored mythical landscape instead of a realistic African savannah?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies replacing the real animals (impalas) with mythical creatures. These could include centaurs, griffins, or other creatures from Greek mythology. Their presence is essential for fulfilling the mythical theme.
Question: Are the animals in the background replaced with mythical creatures such as griffins, centaurs, or sphinxes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The sky must be rendered in the style of classical Greek pottery art, which typically features dramatic contrasts, stylized clouds, and a limited color palette (often black, red, and ochre). The sky should also appear tempestuous, suggesting stormy weather.
Question: Is the sky rendered in a style resembling classical Greek pottery, with stylized clouds and a limited, earth-toned color palette?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The woman’s dynamic dance pose must be preserved despite the transformation. This includes her raised arm, lifted leg, and overall motion, ensuring continuity of action even as appearance changes.
Question: Does the woman maintain a dynamic, mid-dance pose similar to the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
