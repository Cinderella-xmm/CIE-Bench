      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies a \"semi-cartoon style,\" which implies stylized features such as exaggerated proportions, simplified lines, or soft shading typical of cartoon illustrations. This requires assessing whether the character's facial features, clothing, and overall rendering are stylized rather than photorealistic.",
      "question": "Is the laboratory scientist depicted in a semi-cartoon style with stylized features such as simplified lines or exaggerated proportions?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes \"refined laboratory apparatus\" and \"posture.\" This means the equipment (e.g., test tubes, microscopes) should be clearly visible, detailed, and aesthetically presented, while the scientistâ€™s posture should reflect precision and focus, possibly in a standing or leaning position indicative of active work.",
      "question": "Are the laboratory apparatus (such as test tubes, microscope, and monitors) rendered with high detail and clarity to emphasize refinement?",

      "thinking_process": "The color scheme is explicitly defined as \"teal and white tones\" for a sleek scientific aesthetic. This requires checking if the dominant colors in the image are teal and white, especially in the background, lab coat, equipment, and any text or design elements.",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image teal and white, consistent with a sleek scientific aesthetic?",
      "choices": [

      "thinking_process": "The instruction states that each month should highlight a different scientific motif. This implies the presence of multiple monthly sections, each with unique scientific imagery (e.g., DNA helix, neural networks, chemical structures). Since this is a calendar, there should be at least 12 distinct sections or representations.",
      "question": "Does the image include multiple monthly sections, each featuring a different scientific motif such as molecular structures or data patterns?",

      "question": "Are there bold, tech-inspired headers (e.g., futuristic font, glowing or metallic effect) present above each monthly section?",

      "question": "Are data visualization patterns (e.g., circular diagrams, grid layouts, or flowcharts) visibly integrated into the calendar design?",

      "thinking_process": "The material specification \"high-quality gloss paper\" implies a reflective surface, sharp print quality, and possibly subtle sheen on the image surface. While texture cannot always be directly observed, the image should convey a polished, professional finish suggesting glossy printing.",
