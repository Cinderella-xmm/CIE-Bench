Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the motorcycle into a LEGO model using black and blue bricks. This implies that the entire body of the motorcycle must be constructed from visible brick-like elements, with a color scheme limited to black and blue, resembling LEGO construction blocks.
Question: Is the motorcycle composed entirely of black and blue LEGO-style bricks?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The original motorcycle has an angular design; this must be preserved in the LEGO version. The transformation should not soften or round edges but maintain sharp angles and geometric shapes consistent with the original form.
Question: Does the LEGO model retain the angular design features of the original motorcycle?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The wheel rims must be replaced with intricate cog patterns, which are characteristic of mechanical LEGO designs. These cogs should be visibly detailed and not resemble standard spoked or solid rims.
Question: Are the wheel rims replaced with intricate cog patterns typical of LEGO mechanical parts?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Colorful decals must be used as printed tile elements. This means that the decorative graphics (such as logos, stripes, or characters) should appear as if they are printed onto LEGO tiles, maintaining their colors and placement while fitting the blocky aesthetic.
Question: Are the original decals represented as colorful printed tiles on the LEGO model?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The model must be mounted on a smooth gray baseplate with directional arrows. This indicates a flat, uniform gray platform beneath the motorcycle, featuring arrow markings to suggest movement or direction.
Question: Is the LEGO model placed on a smooth gray baseplate with directional arrows?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The original stripe dynamics—referring to the flow and pattern of the blue and black stripes on the motorcycle—must be preserved in the LEGO version. This means the arrangement and visual rhythm of the stripes should remain recognizable even in brick form.
Question: Do the blue and black stripes follow the same dynamic flow and positioning as in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The final presentation requires the model to be positioned in a clean display case. This implies a transparent or enclosed environment with minimal distractions, possibly with lighting or reflective surfaces, designed to highlight the model.
Question: Is the LEGO model displayed within a clean, enclosed display case?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
