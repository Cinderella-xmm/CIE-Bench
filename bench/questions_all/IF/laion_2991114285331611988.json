      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly states that the suits should be anthropomorphized as secretive agents. This means the human figures must be transformed into cartoon-like characters with exaggerated features, possibly with limbs or facial expressions, while retaining their suit identities.",
      "question": "Are the two men in the image transformed into cartoon-style anthropomorphic agents with visible agent-like characteristics (e.g., expressive faces, limbs, spy traits)?",

      "thinking_process": "The plaid tie must check a secret watch communicator, indicating a specific gadget interaction. This requires observing if the plaid-patterned tie has a wristwatch-like device attached or integrated into it, and if there is a visual cue of urgency (e.g., wide eyes, motion lines).",
      "question": "Does the plaid-patterned tie have a visible watch communicator device, and is there a visual expression of urgency (such as motion lines or an alarmed facial expression)?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The tie with the emblem must activate a hidden camera, with the lens symbolically embedded in its pattern. This requires checking if the emblem on the second tie contains a circular element resembling a camera lens, and if there is an indication of activation (e.g., glowing light, red dot).",
      "question": "Is there a circular camera lens symbol embedded within the pattern of the tie with the emblem, and is there a visual indication of activation (e.g., glow, red dot)?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Thought bubbles are required to convey internal thoughts of the characters, consistent with comic strip conventions. These should appear near the agents' heads and contain text or symbols reflecting their mental state.",
      "question": "Are there thought bubbles present above or near the heads of the anthropomorphized agents?",

      "question_id": "Q7",
