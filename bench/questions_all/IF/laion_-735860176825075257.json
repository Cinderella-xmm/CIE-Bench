      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies a \"paper-cut style\" with \"sharp, angular edges\" to emphasize Tudor architectural features such as half-timbering and gabled roofs. This implies that all structural elements—especially the timber framing, rooflines, and windows—should appear stylized with clean, crisp lines and no soft gradients or naturalistic shading, resembling cut-out paper layers.",
      "question": "Are all architectural elements of the building rendered with sharp, angular edges characteristic of a paper-cut art style?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires \"gold foil accents\" specifically on window frames and plant motifs. Gold foil would appear as reflective, metallic highlights, distinct from standard color fills, typically used to draw attention and add contrast. These should be visible on the white window panes and flower boxes.",
