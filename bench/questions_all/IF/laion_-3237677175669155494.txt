- Morph the red buses into hovering mechanical sentinels with glowing blue underlights
- Modify Big Ben into a towering golden automaton, its clockface a radiant cosmic eye

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the red buses into hovering mechanical sentinels. This involves changing their physical form from standard double-decker buses to mechanical constructs capable of flight, including visible structural modifications such as metallic frames, propulsion systems, and hover mechanics. The glowing blue underlights are a specific visual feature that must be present beneath each bus to indicate active energy or propulsion.
Question: Are the red buses replaced with mechanical sentinels that hover above the ground and have glowing blue underlights?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies modifying Big Ben into a golden automaton, meaning it should no longer appear as a stone clock tower but instead as a robotic structure made of gold-like material. The clock face must be transformed into a cosmic eye—implying a spherical, radiant, possibly star-filled or nebula-like design that emits light and resembles an eye in appearance.
Question: Is Big Ben transformed into a golden automaton with a clock face that appears as a radiant cosmic eye?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for enveloping the Houses of Parliament with winding energetic vines that pulse softly. These vines must be visually distinct—likely glowing or translucent—and should wrap around the architectural features of the building in a natural yet supernatural way. The term "pulsating" implies dynamic lighting changes or rhythmic glow effects.
Question: Are the Houses of Parliament covered with winding, glowing vines that exhibit soft pulsating light effects?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction requires adding airships patrolling overhead. These airships must be visibly present in the sky above the scene, not just implied. Their hulls must display iridescent scales, which suggests a shimmering, rainbow-like surface texture that reflects multiple colors depending on angle and light.
Question: Are there airships visible in the sky above the scene, with hulls featuring iridescent, scale-like surfaces?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The overall transformation must align with a "fantastical cityscape guardian" theme. This means all modified elements (buses, Big Ben, Parliament, airships) must contribute to a cohesive fantasy aesthetic involving advanced technology, magical elements, and a sense of protection or guardianship. The style should not resemble real-world London but rather a reimagined, mythical version.
Question: Does the entire scene maintain a consistent fantastical cityscape guardian theme, integrating mechanical, magical, and celestial elements cohesively?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
