This implies structural changes such as adding text, labels, and layout elements typical of infographics. The core requirement is whether the image now functions as an infographic rather than a standalone nature photograph.",
      "question": "Is the image formatted as an educational infographic with structured layout elements such as titles, labels, and text boxes?",
