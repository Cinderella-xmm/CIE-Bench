Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the original sandcastle into a miniature 3D model. This implies a reduction in scale, increased detail, and a shift from a real-world beach structure to a curated collectible object. The model must appear smaller, more refined, and stylized as if designed for display.
Question: Is the sandcastle now presented as a scaled-down, highly detailed miniature 3D model?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: A spherical glass dome is explicitly mentioned as the container for the model. This means the model should be fully enclosed within a transparent, spherical structure that allows viewing from all angles, suggesting a protective display case typical of collectibles.
Question: Is the sandcastle enclosed within a transparent spherical glass dome?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The base must be sculpted mahogany, which implies a dark brown, polished wooden platform with visible grain and craftsmanship. It should support the glass dome and contribute to the luxurious aesthetic.
Question: Is the glass dome placed on a sculpted base made of mahogany wood?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Fine, glittering grains are required to emulate sandy texture. These should be visible as small reflective particles embedded in or applied over the surface of the sandcastle model to mimic the sparkle of real sand under light.
Question: Are fine, glittering grains visibly applied to the surface of the sandcastle to simulate a sandy texture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Tiny, ornately detailed seashells must be incorporated around the castle. These should be clearly distinguishable from regular shells, showing intricate patterns, and positioned near the base or along the perimeter of the model.
Question: Are tiny, ornately detailed seashells placed around the base of the sandcastle model?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A soft, matte pearl finish implies a non-reflective, slightly luminous surface tone across the entire model and surrounding elements. This finish should give a subtle sheen without glare, enhancing the luxury feel.
Question: Does the entire model and surrounding elements have a soft, matte pearl-like finish?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: A ceramic plaque with the inscription “Empire of the Shores” must be present. It should be made of ceramic, legibly inscribed, and placed in a visible location such as the base or side of the display.
Question: Is there a ceramic plaque with the words “Empire of the Shores” elegantly inscribed and visible in the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
