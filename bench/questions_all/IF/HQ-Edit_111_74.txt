Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies converting the kimono's pattern into gold foil detailing. This implies that the existing floral embroidery should now appear metallic and reflective, resembling actual gold foil application. Gold foil typically has a shiny, slightly raised texture and high reflectivity, which must be visually distinguishable from regular thread or paint.
Question: Has the floral embroidery on the kimono been transformed into gold foil detailing with visible metallic sheen?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Iridescent highlights in hair refer to shimmering, color-shifting effects that mimic light refraction, often seen in holographic or pearlescent finishes. These should be visible as subtle rainbow-like reflections along strands of hair, especially where light hits.
Question: Are there iridescent highlights present in the woman's hair, showing color-shifting effects under light?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The background must feature stylized bamboo rendered in watercolor style. Watercolor characteristics include soft edges, blended colors, translucent washes, and visible brushstrokes. The bamboo should not appear photorealistic but artistically interpreted.
Question: Is the bamboo in the background rendered in a watercolor style with soft edges and translucent washes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Floral-shaped writing spaces imply designated areas within the image—likely near the edges or integrated into the design—that are shaped like flowers and intended for text. These should be clearly defined yet decorative.
Question: Are there floral-shaped areas in the image that serve as writing spaces, positioned to allow text placement?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Embossed borders suggest a raised, three-dimensional effect around the edges of the image, mimicking physical embossing. This would involve visible depth, shadowing, or texture along the perimeter, enhancing the postcard's elegance.
Question: Does the image have embossed borders with a raised or textured appearance along the edges?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The original image features a woman in a red kimono with floral embroidery. The instruction requires maintaining this core visual while applying transformations. Therefore, the kimono must still be red and identifiable as having floral patterns, even if modified.
Question: Is the woman wearing a red kimono with floral embroidery, consistent with the original description?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
