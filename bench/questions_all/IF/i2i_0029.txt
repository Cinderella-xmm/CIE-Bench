Q1:
Thinking process: The core requirement is ensuring that the zebra's stripes extend outside its body and merge with the grass, forming a continuous pattern. This involves verifying the visual continuity between the zebra and the surrounding environment.
Question: Do the zebra's stripes extend outward and integrate seamlessly with the grass?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:

Question: Does the image exhibit a surrealistic style, creating an imaginative blend between the zebra and the environment?
Choices: Yes, No
