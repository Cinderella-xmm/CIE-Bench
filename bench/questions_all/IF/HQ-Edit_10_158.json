      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly requires transforming the hiking boot into a wooden sculpture. This means the material must change from leather and synthetic components to wood, with visible carving details indicating it is not a real boot but a crafted object. The transformation must be complete and recognizable as wood-based.",
      "question": "Is the hiking boot replaced with a finely carved wooden sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The original boot has distinct structural elements such as panels, eyelets, and lacing. These must be preserved in form and placement even though they are now made of wood. The laces should appear as carved or inlaid wooden strands following the same path as the original.",
      "question": "Are the detailed panels and lacing of the original boot preserved in the wooden sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies using light and dark wood tones to mimic the original leather’s appearance. This implies a color gradient and contrast similar to the original boot—dark areas where shadows fall, lighter areas on raised surfaces—to simulate texture and depth.",
      "question": "Are light and dark wood tones used to replicate the original leather texture and sole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The new scene must feature a minimalist wooden shelf beneath the sculpture. This shelf should be simple in design—without ornamentation—and made of wood to match the sculpture’s material, enhancing the crafted aesthetic.",
      "question": "Is the wooden sculpture positioned on a minimalist wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Subtle grain patterns are required to enhance realism. Wood grain should be visible across the surface of the sculpture, particularly along the curves and edges, to suggest natural material rather than painted or plastic imitation.",
      "question": "Are subtle grain patterns visible on the surface of the wooden sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes the robust form of the shoe, meaning the overall shape, thickness, and structural integrity must remain true to the original boot. The sculpture should not appear fragile or stylized beyond recognition—it must retain its sturdy, functional appearance.",
      "question": "Does the wooden sculpture maintain the robust form of the original hiking boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
