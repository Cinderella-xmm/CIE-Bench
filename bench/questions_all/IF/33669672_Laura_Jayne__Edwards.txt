- Extend the legs into curves to create a dynamic flow
- Replace floral details with geometric patterns
- Maintain the original color palette in metallic tones

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the figure into an Art Deco-inspired bronze sculpture. This implies a shift in material appearance (to bronze), style (Art Deco features such as symmetry, sharp angles, and ornamentation), and texture (metallic sheen). The figure should no longer appear human but rather sculptural and stylized.
Question: Is the figure rendered as a bronze sculpture with a metallic surface finish?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires elongated limbs to emphasize grace and movement. This means arms and legs should be visibly longer than natural proportions, especially in relation to the torso, to enhance the sense of fluidity and elegance.
Question: Are the limbs visibly elongated compared to natural human proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states that legs should be extended into curves to create dynamic flow. This means the legs must follow curved, flowing lines rather than straight or natural anatomical shapes, contributing to a sense of motion and rhythm.
Question: Do the legs form smooth, curved shapes that suggest dynamic movement?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Floral details in the original image (on boots and around legs) must be replaced with geometric patterns. These patterns should reflect Art Deco style—such as zigzags, chevrons, sunbursts, or symmetrical linear designs—and not resemble organic flowers.
Question: Have all floral elements been replaced with geometric patterns consistent with Art Deco design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The original color palette includes teal, red, and pink. The instruction requires maintaining this palette but in metallic tones. Therefore, colors should be transformed into metallic versions (e.g., teal → metallic teal, red → copper/bronze red, pink → rose gold).
Question: Are the colors in the image rendered in metallic tones while preserving the original color scheme (teal, red, pink)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The background must be set to a matching turquoise base to ensure cohesion. This means the backdrop should be a solid, uniform turquoise color that complements the metallic tones of the sculpture.
Question: Is the background a solid, uniform turquoise color matching the overall aesthetic?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The instruction emphasizes "elegant Art Deco-inspired" design, which includes stylized adornments such as symmetrical patterns, stepped forms, and decorative borders. These should be present on the sculpture’s surface, especially where floral elements were.
Question: Are the adornments on the figure composed of symmetrical, angular, or repetitive geometric motifs typical of Art Deco style?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
