Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the cityscape into a watercolor style. This implies visible brushstroke textures, soft color blending, and lack of sharp digital edges—characteristic features of watercolor paintings. The original image is a painted oil-style landscape, so the edit must visually shift to softer, translucent washes typical of watercolor.
Question: Is the cityscape rendered in a watercolor style with visible brushstrokes and soft blending?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires that warm pink and blue tones dominate the scene. This means the sky, sea, and buildings should primarily feature hues from the pink (warm) and blue (cool) spectrum, with no other colors overpowering them.
Question: Do warm pink and blue tones dominate the overall color palette of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: An anthropomorphic cat character must be added, specifically wearing a striped sailor shirt and a beret. These are distinct clothing items that must be clearly visible and correctly placed on a feline figure.
Question: Is there an anthropomorphic cat character wearing a striped sailor shirt and a beret present in the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The cat must be positioned on one of the rooftops and gazing toward the coastline. This involves both spatial placement (on a rooftop) and directional orientation (facing the sea).
Question: Is the cat character standing on a rooftop and facing toward the coastline?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The narrative text must be included exactly as specified: 'Pepper the Cat's Neapolitan Adventure: Searching for the Legendary Vesuvian Treasure.' It should be legible and placed somewhere within the frame, likely near the top or bottom.
Question: Is the text 'Pepper the Cat's Neapolitan Adventure: Searching for the Legendary Vesuvian Treasure' visible and legible in the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Decorative borders resembling Italian tile patterns must be added along the edges of the page. These should mimic traditional Italian mosaic or ceramic tile designs, such as geometric or floral motifs in earthy or vibrant colors.
Question: Are decorative borders resembling Italian tile patterns present along all four edges of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The entire composition must resemble a storybook page, which implies a framed layout, possibly with margin space, stylized fonts, and illustrative elements consistent with children’s book design.
Question: Does the image appear as a complete storybook page, including layout, margins, and illustrative style appropriate for a children's story?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
