Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the lime wedge should serve as a "smiling cap" for the margarita glass character. This implies the lime slice must be positioned on top of the glass in a way that visually suggests a hat-like shape with a smile, such as a curved or angled placement to mimic facial features.
Question: Is the lime wedge positioned on top of the glass in a way that resembles a smiling cap?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The ice cubes are explicitly stated to function as "eyes" for the character. This requires two distinct ice cubes placed symmetrically within the glass to resemble eyes, likely near the upper portion of the drink.
Question: Are two ice cubes positioned within the glass to resemble eyes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The sugared rim is described as forming a "grin," meaning the rim should be shaped or highlighted to suggest a smiling mouth, possibly through color variation, texture emphasis, or visual design that curves upward like a smile.
Question: Does the sugared rim of the glass form a visible grin-like shape?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A "fashionable sombrero" must be added as an accessory. This means a recognizable sombrero—complete with brim and crown—should be visibly attached to or placed on the glass character, enhancing its anthropomorphic appearance.
Question: Is a sombrero clearly visible and attached to the margarita glass character?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Maracas are specified as accessories, so two maraca instruments (typically handheld rattles) should be present in the scene, either held by the character or nearby, contributing to the festive theme.
Question: Are maracas visible in the image as accessories to the character?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction requires colorful confetti to surround the character. This means small, bright, scattered pieces of paper or decorative elements should be distributed around the glass, adding to the festive atmosphere.
Question: Is colorful confetti visible around the margarita glass character?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The text “Fiesta Time!” must appear in a bold, vibrant typeface at the top of the image. This requires clear legibility, appropriate font weight, vivid color, and positioning near the top edge of the frame.
Question: Is the text “Fiesta Time!” displayed in bold, vibrant lettering at the top of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: The overall tone must be whimsical and cartoonish, resembling a cocktail ad poster. This includes exaggerated features, playful styling, and a fun, celebratory aesthetic that aligns with advertising a festive beverage.
Question: Does the edited image have a whimsical, cartoonish style consistent with a festive cocktail ad poster?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
