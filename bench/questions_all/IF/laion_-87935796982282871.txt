- Transform the bed into a cozy woodland creature with patchwork fur of the blanket's colors
- Turn the pillows into a pair of alert ears trimmed with soft leaves
- Replace the bed frame with slender, branch-like legs
- Add a bushy, plush red tail extending from the bottom of the comforter
- Maintain the original blanket’s color scheme (red, gray, navy, white) in the patchwork fur texture
- Ensure the ears are positioned at the top of the bed and shaped like animal ears
- Ensure the leaves trimming the ears appear soft and natural
- Ensure the branch-like legs are thin, organic in shape, and replace the original black bed frame
- Ensure the red tail is fluffy, voluminous, and extends from the lower edge of the comforter

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the bed into a woodland creature using the blanket’s colors as patchwork fur. This implies that the surface of the bed must visually resemble animal fur made from stitched patches in red, gray, navy, and white—matching the original blanket’s palette. The transformation should cover the entire visible surface of the bed.
Question: Is the surface of the bed covered in patchwork fur made from the colors red, gray, navy, and white, resembling animal fur?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The pillows must be transformed into alert ears trimmed with soft leaves. This means the two standard pillows should now have an ear-like shape (pointed or rounded), and their edges should be lined with leaf-shaped elements that look soft and natural.
Question: Are the pillows reshaped into pointed or rounded ears and trimmed with soft-looking leaves along their edges?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The original black bed frame must be replaced with slender, branch-like legs. These legs should mimic tree branches—thin, irregular in shape, and organic in appearance—replacing the solid rectangular frame entirely.
Question: Has the black bed frame been replaced with thin, branch-like legs that resemble natural tree limbs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A bushy, plush red tail must extend from the bottom of the comforter. This means there should be a voluminous, fluffy red appendage attached to the lower end of the blanket, resembling a tail, and it should be clearly visible and distinct from the blanket itself.
Question: Is there a bushy, plush red tail extending from the bottom edge of the comforter?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The overall transformation must maintain the color scheme of the original blanket—red, gray, navy, and white—in the patchwork fur design. Any deviation from these colors would violate the instruction to use the blanket’s colors.
Question: Does the patchwork fur on the bed use only the colors red, gray, navy, and white as seen in the original blanket?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
