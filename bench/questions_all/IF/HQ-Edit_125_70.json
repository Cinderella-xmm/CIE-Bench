This implies a shift from a purely functional workshop to a curated, brand-focused presentation. Key indicators include added branding elements like logos, typography, and business cards, while preserving the core imagery. The presence of these elements would confirm the transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires elegant typography to be integrated onto the wood shavings. This means text should be present on the curled wood pieces, not just near them. The font should appear refined and legible, consistent with a high-end brand.",
      "question": "Are there elegant, readable typographic elements displayed directly on the wood shavings scattered across the workbench?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The pegboard must be rendered in grayscale, but with copper-colored accents. This means the background board should lack color (black and white or shades of gray), while certain elements—such as tool handles, hooks, or fasteners—should feature copper tones to contrast the monochrome base.",
      "question": "Is the pegboard in grayscale with visible copper-colored accents on tools or hardware?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "question_id": "Q6",

      "question": "Are all original tools visible and retained in their original positions on the pegboard?",
