Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the central body of the drone into a robotic face while preserving sharp edges. This implies the presence of facial features such as eyes, mouth, or sensors arranged in a face-like configuration, using angular or geometric shapes consistent with a futuristic aesthetic.
Question: Is the central body of the drone redesigned to resemble a robotic face with sharp, angular features?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The rotor blades must be converted into arms capable of rotating freely, suggesting they are no longer static propellers but articulated limbs with joint-like structures, possibly ending in hands or thrusters, and positioned dynamically as if in motion.
Question: Are the rotor blades replaced with arm-like structures that appear to be capable of rotation and are positioned as if in motion?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The landing gears need to be transformed into spider-like legs, meaning they should resemble multiple thin, jointed appendages extending from the body, resembling arachnid limbs, likely with segmented joints and a mechanical look.
Question: Are the original landing gears replaced with multiple spider-like mechanical legs extending from the drone’s body?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The scene must depict the character in mid-flight over a futuristic cityscape, which includes elements like tall skyscrapers with neon lighting, flying vehicles, or advanced architecture typical of sci-fi environments.
Question: Is the character shown in mid-flight above a detailed futuristic cityscape with high-rise buildings and advanced urban elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A sleek metallic aura implies reflective surfaces, chrome finishes, glowing accents, or light reflections suggesting metal construction. This should be visible across the character’s body, especially on the face, arms, and legs.
Question: Does the character exhibit a sleek metallic surface with reflective textures, chrome finishes, or glowing highlights indicating a metallic aura?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies adding speech bubbles with the exact phrase “Secure the Quantum Core!” in a bold, tech-style font. This means there must be at least one speech bubble containing this text, styled with sharp lines, digital fonts, or circuit-like effects typical of technology-themed comics.
Question: Is there a speech bubble present with the text “Secure the Quantum Core!” written in a bold, tech-style font?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
