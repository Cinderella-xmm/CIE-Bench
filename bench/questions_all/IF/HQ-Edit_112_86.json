      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the teapot into a glass sculpture. This means the material must change from metal to glass, and the object should appear transparent or semi-transparent. The core transformation is material-based, so we assess whether the object now appears made of glass rather than solid metal.",
      "question": "Is the main body of the teapot made of clear glass?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the main structure should be made of clear glass. This implies transparency, allowing visibility through the body of the teapot. We need to verify if light passes through the body and if internal details are visible.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires frosted floral patterns that mimic the original engravings. These patterns must be visibly different from the surrounding clear glass—appearing opaque or textured—and should replicate the original rose and leaf designs.",
      "question": "Are there frosted floral patterns on the surface of the teapot that resemble the original engraved rose and leaves?",

      "thinking_process": "The handle and spout are to be enhanced with tinted amber glass for contrast. This means these parts should have a distinct color (amber) compared to the clear body, and they should still maintain their functional shape.",

      "thinking_process": "The teapot must be placed on a mirrored surface to emphasize its transparency and delicate craftsmanship. A mirrored surface reflects the object and creates symmetry, which can be observed as a clear reflection beneath the teapot.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The original design includes intricate floral engravings. The instruction requires these to be preserved in the frosted glass form. Thus, the detailed patterns such as roses, leaves, and vines must remain recognizable and stylistically consistent with the original.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall shape and structure of the teapot must remain consistent with the original—retaining the rounded body, curved spout, and handle placement. Any deviation would indicate a failure to preserve the original form despite material change.",
