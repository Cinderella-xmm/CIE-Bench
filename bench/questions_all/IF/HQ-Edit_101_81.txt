Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the image into an ancient Indian fresco style. This implies a shift from realistic photography to a stylized, two-dimensional artistic representation typical of Indian temple murals—characterized by flat color fields, minimal shading, outlined figures, and symbolic composition. The presence of such stylistic elements is essential for compliance.
Question: Is the image rendered in a flat, two-dimensional fresco style with minimal depth and strong outlines, resembling ancient Indian wall paintings?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The woman must be depicted as an elegant dancer in traditional attire, which implies a change from modern athletic wear to garments like a sari or classical dance costume, often with layered fabrics, jewelry, and graceful draping. This transformation must be visually distinct from the original clothing.
Question: Has the woman’s outfit been replaced with vibrant, flowing traditional Indian dance attire, such as a sari or similar garment with ornate patterns and fabric folds?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The clothing must feature vibrant colors and intricate patterns typical of Indian textiles, such as paisley, floral motifs, or geometric designs. These should be clearly visible and integrated into the fabric design.
Question: Are the woman’s garments adorned with colorful, detailed patterns consistent with traditional Indian textile art, such as embroidery, block prints, or meenakari-style designs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The background must be stylized as a mural with sacred symbols and motifs, such as lotus flowers, mandalas, deities, or Sanskrit inscriptions, commonly found in Hindu temples and ancient frescoes. The current neutral room setting must be replaced.
Question: Does the background feature mural-like designs with sacred Indian symbols, such as lotuses, om signs, or divine figures, painted in a fresco style?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Cultural artifacts like oil lamps (diyas), ornate frames, or ritualistic objects must be present to enhance the spiritual ambiance. These are key indicators of authenticity in ancient Indian religious or devotional art.
Question: Are there cultural artifacts such as oil lamps, incense holders, or decorative architectural elements integrated into the scene to reflect a spiritual or ritualistic setting?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The core yoga pose (tree pose) must be preserved despite the stylistic transformation. The figure must still balance on one leg with hands in prayer position above the head, maintaining anatomical alignment and grace.
Question: Is the woman still performing the tree pose (Vrikshasana) with one foot placed on the inner thigh of the standing leg and hands in Anjali Mudra above her head?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
