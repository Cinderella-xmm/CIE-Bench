Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the butterfly into a whimsical flower fairy, which implies a complete morphological shift from insect to fairy-like being. This includes changes in form, texture, and magical qualities. A "whimsical" appearance should be evident through fantastical design elements such as ethereal features or enchanting proportions.
Question: Has the butterfly been transformed into a fairy-like figure with humanoid or magical characteristics?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The wings must be replaced entirely with translucent petal-like patterns. This means no trace of original butterfly wing structure (veins, scales, etc.) should remain. The new wings should resemble layered, semi-transparent petals, possibly with soft edges and light diffusion effects.
Question: Are the wings replaced with translucent, petal-like structures instead of traditional butterfly wings?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Antennae must be converted into golden tendrils that sparkle. This involves changing their material to gold and adding visual effects like glitter or shimmer. They should no longer resemble insect antennae but rather elegant, glowing filaments.
Question: Have the antennae been replaced with golden, sparkling tendrils?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The body must be infused with colorful floral textures, meaning the surface of the fairyâ€™s body should display patterns resembling flowers, leaves, or botanical motifs in vibrant colors. These textures should cover the torso and limbs if visible.
Question: Does the body feature visible colorful floral textures integrated into its surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The eyes must become glowing sapphire orbs. This requires replacing the original eyes with bright blue, luminous spheres that emit light. The glow should be noticeable and distinct from ambient lighting.
Question: Do the eyes appear as glowing sapphire-colored orbs emitting light?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A starry trail must be added behind the fairy as it hovers, suggesting motion and magic. This trail should consist of small, bright stars or sparkles forming a path trailing from the fairy's rear, likely fading into the background.
Question: Is there a visible starry trail emanating from the fairy as it hovers?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The surroundings must be changed to a dreamlike meadow with surreal floating blooms. This means the background should no longer be a natural field but a fantastical landscape with floating flowers, soft lighting, and an ethereal atmosphere. Blooms should appear suspended in midair.
Question: Are the surroundings transformed into a dreamlike meadow with surreal floating flowers?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
