- Convert the log cabin into a giant geometric crystal structure

- Transform the wooden beams into meticulously cut multifaceted edges
- Set the crystal cabin on a flat white marble platform
- Include small crystal formations as decorative accents along the base

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire log cabin into a geometric crystal structure. This means the original wood-based architecture must be replaced with a crystalline form composed of angular, transparent facets. The core visual identity of the building should no longer resemble wood or traditional construction but instead appear as a large, complex gem-like structure.
Question: Has the log cabin been replaced with a geometric crystal structure made of transparent, faceted surfaces?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The exterior material must now be transparent and faceted, reflecting light in hues of blue and green. This implies visible refraction, iridescence, or chromatic effects across the surface, not just painted colors. The transparency should allow partial visibility through the structure.
Question: Do the exterior surfaces of the structure consist of transparent, faceted planes that reflect or refract blue and green hues?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Wooden beams are explicitly mentioned to be transformed into multifaceted edges. This means all structural supports, columns, and framing elements must no longer appear as rounded or natural wood logs but as precisely cut, sharp-edged crystal components.
Question: Have all wooden beams and structural supports been replaced with meticulously cut, multifaceted crystal edges?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The foundation of the structure must now rest on a flat, uniform white marble platform. This implies a smooth, polished, reflective surface contrasting with the surrounding natural ground, and it must fully support the base of the crystal structure.
Question: Is the crystal structure resting on a flat, white marble platform?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Small crystal formations are required as decorative accents along the base. These should be distinct from the main structure—smaller, irregularly shaped, possibly clustered—and placed around the perimeter of the platform to enhance the crystalline theme.
Question: Are there small crystal formations present as decorative accents along the base of the structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
