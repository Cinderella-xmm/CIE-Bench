Q1:
Thinking process: The editing instruction specifies designing the couple's backs as a crystal silhouette. This involves transforming their backs into a clear, glass-like appearance while maintaining the original shape but as a transparent form.
Question: Have the couple's backs been designed as a crystal silhouette?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Since the design is for Valentine’s Day gifts, certain romantic elements might be implied, such as heart shapes, soft colors, or elegant designs. However, the instructions focus on a crystal silhouette, so we verify only this specific aspect.
Question: Does the design maintain the integrity of the couple's original back shape as silhouettes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Crystal silhouettes typically convey transparency and reflective qualities. Therefore, the couple's backs should appear transparent and possibly include reflective highlights.
Question: Do the couple’s back silhouettes show transparency and reflective qualities?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Ensuring that the rest of the image remains unchanged apart from the couple’s backs is important. This means the surrounding environment, including the bench, tree, and grass, should stay intact.
Question: Is the surrounding environment (bench, tree, grass) unchanged except for the edited couple’s backs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction "suitable for Valentine's Day gifts" implies a design that aligns well with the aesthetic of gift-giving during Valentine's Day. Since the primary change is a crystal silhouette, this question checks if the overall design is aesthetically appropriate for this occasion.
Question: Does the overall design, featuring the crystal silhouettes of the couple, align with the aesthetic suitable for Valentine's Day gifts?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
