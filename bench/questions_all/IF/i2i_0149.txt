```
- Make the cat’s head slightly extend out of the frame 
- Show a curled tongue with clear spatial depth  
- Create a visual illusion of the cat peeking out from the frame
- Maintain the natural appearance of the cat while incorporating the above changes
```
```
Q1:
Thinking process: We need to ensure that the cat's head visibly extends beyond the frame boundaries, which is a direct measure of compliance with the given instruction. The focus is on the head's placement rather than overall composition.
Question: Does the cat’s head extend slightly beyond the frame edges?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The spatial depth of the curled tongue indicates how effectively the tongue appears three-dimensional and realistic. It must look as though it protrudes naturally from the mouth.
Question: Does the curled tongue show clear spatial depth, giving a 3D effect?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: To create the visual illusion of the cat peeking out, the head position and angle should give viewers a sense that the cat is looking over or around the frame boundary.
Question: Does the position and angle of the cat’s head create a visual illusion of peeking out from the frame?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The goal of maintaining the natural appearance ensures that the edits do not disrupt the realism of the cat's features apart from the instructed changes.
Question: Does the edited image maintain a natural appearance for the cat, aside from the instructed modifications?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The integration of the edits should be seamless so that the head extension and tongue depth appear convincingly within the context of the image.
Question: Are the edits seamlessly integrated with the rest of the image, with no noticeable artificial artifacts?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
