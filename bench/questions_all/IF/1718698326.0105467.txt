Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the image into a digital RPG-style character card. This implies that the entire composition should resemble a collectible card, including structured layout, text elements, and framing. The presence of a border, stat bars, and title/nameplate are key indicators.
Question: Is the image formatted as a digital character card with a defined rectangular frame and structured layout resembling an RPG collectible?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The poodle must be depicted in a couture dress, specifically a layered white skirt, and wearing a heart-shaped pendant. These are explicitly mentioned visual details that must be present to satisfy the character design requirement.
Question: Does the poodle wear a white, layered couture dress and a visible heart-shaped pendant around its neck?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The style must be a polished 3D cartoon look, which includes smooth surfaces, exaggerated proportions (like fluffy fur), and stylized lighting. This means the rendering should not appear photorealistic but rather animated and refined.
Question: Is the poodle rendered in a 3D cartoon style with exaggerated fluffy fur, smooth textures, and stylized lighting?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The stat bars must include specific attributes with exact values: Elegance +10, Agility +8, Charisma +9, Fashion Sense +10. These need to be clearly displayed as text elements on the card.
Question: Are the following stat bars present and correctly labeled: [Elegance +10], [Agility +8], [Charisma +9], [Fashion Sense +10]?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A gilded title banner at the top and a silver nameplate at the bottom are required. The nameplate must specify the class “Glamour Bard.” These are distinct UI elements that must be visually identifiable.
Question: Is there a gilded banner at the top of the card and a silver nameplate at the bottom displaying the class “Glamour Bard”?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The card must have beveled metallic edges, which implies a 3D border effect with reflective or shiny material along the perimeter of the card, giving it a premium collectible appearance.
Question: Does the card have a beveled metallic border around its edges?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The backdrop must be a stylized harbor scene echoing the Sydney Opera House. While the original image shows the Opera House, the edited version must maintain this landmark in a stylized form consistent with the cartoon aesthetic.
Question: Is the background a stylized harbor scene featuring a recognizable depiction of the Sydney Opera House?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
