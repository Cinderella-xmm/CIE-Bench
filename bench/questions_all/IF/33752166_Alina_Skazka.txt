Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the building into a mechanical golem. This involves adding mechanical features such as limbs and gears. A "yes" answer would mean the structure now clearly resembles a robot with visible joints, limbs, and mechanical components, not just a stylized version of the original building.
Question: Does the edited image show the building transformed into a giant mechanical golem with visible articulated limbs and exposed gears?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The windows must be replaced with glowing panels of energy. This implies that the original glass windows are no longer present and have been substituted with luminous surfaces emitting light, likely in a consistent color scheme such as blue, yellow, or white, typical of energy sources in mechanical designs.
Question: Are all original windows replaced with glowing energy panels that emit light?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Balconies must morph into arm-like appendages. This means each balcony should be reshaped into a limb-like structure, possibly with joints and mechanical articulation, extending outward from the building’s body like arms.
Question: Have the balconies been transformed into arm-like mechanical appendages extending from the building?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Intricate circuit patterns must be added across the entire structure to emphasize its robotic nature. These should resemble electronic pathways, such as printed circuit board lines, running along walls, joints, and surfaces.
Question: Are there visible intricate circuit patterns covering the surface of the building, resembling electronic wiring or circuits?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The angular edges of the building must be reimagined as dynamic, moving parts. This suggests that sharp corners or protrusions now appear as rotating, hinged, or shifting elements, implying motion even if static in the image.
Question: Do the building's angular edges appear as dynamic or movable mechanical components, such as hinges, pistons, or rotating joints?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The original composition includes a clear blue sky background. The instruction does not mention changing the background, so it should remain intact and unaltered in the final edit.
Question: Is the background still a clear blue sky without any changes or additions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The transformation must preserve the building’s position and scale relative to the frame. The golem should occupy the same spatial area as the original building, maintaining visual alignment and proportion within the image.
Question: Has the building’s overall size and position within the frame remained consistent with the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
