Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly requires adding a golden butterfly above the mirror. The placement must be observable, and the color (golden) needs to match described expectations.
Question: Has a butterfly been added above the mirror?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The butterfly should be golden as per the instruction. The color should reflect a shade of gold or similar, aligning with the lighting aesthetics of the bathroom.
Question: Is the butterfly golden in appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the butterfly should be positioned "above the mirror," indicating a spatial location relative to the mirror.
Question: Is the butterfly placed above rather than beside or below the mirror?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction requires consistency with the lighting and environment. This means the butterfly should appear illuminated by the light around the mirror, without clashing harshly against the existing tone.
Question: Does the butterfly blend naturally with the lighting around the mirror?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Environmental consistency means the butterfly should harmonize with other design elements. It shouldn't disrupt the modern aesthetic or appear out of place visually.

Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
