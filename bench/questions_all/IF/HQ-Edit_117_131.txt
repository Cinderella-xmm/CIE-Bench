Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly requires adding a colorful backpack. This means a visible backpack must be present on the squirrel, with multiple bright or contrasting colors, not just a plain or monochrome one. It should be positioned on the squirrel’s back, proportionally sized for a squirrel character.
Question: Is there a colorful backpack visible on the squirrel's back?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies adding glasses. These should be clearly visible on the squirrel’s face, resembling typical eyewear such as round or oval frames, likely in a cartoonish style suitable for a children's book character.
Question: Are glasses visible on the squirrel's face?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The fur color change is a key transformation requirement. The original gray and white fur must be replaced entirely with pastel purple as the base color, with distinct teal accents—such as on the ears, tail, or limbs—to match the described palette. Any remaining gray or natural tones would violate this instruction.
Question: Has the squirrel’s fur been changed to pastel purple with visible teal accents?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The background must be transformed from a wooden fence and grass into a whimsical forest scene. This implies elements such as stylized trees, soft lighting, possibly floating leaves or magical elements, and a setting that feels fantastical rather than realistic. The current image shows a real-world backyard, so this needs full replacement.
Question: Is the background a whimsical forest scene with fantasy-like elements such as stylized trees or magical lighting?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Cartoonish flowers and mushrooms are required to surround the squirrel. These should be exaggerated in shape and color, with rounded forms, bright hues, and possibly non-natural patterns. They must appear around the squirrel in the foreground or midground, not just in the original flower bed.
Question: Are cartoonish flowers and mushrooms visible surrounding the squirrel?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A title banner with specific text and font style is required. The banner must be placed above the squirrel, displaying the exact phrase “Adventures of Sammy the Squirrel” in playful, child-friendly typography—such as bubbly letters, uneven baselines, or decorative outlines.
Question: Is there a title banner above the squirrel with the text "Adventures of Sammy the Squirrel" in playful typography?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The overall aesthetic must reflect a children's book character. This includes exaggerated proportions, soft edges, vibrant colors, and a cheerful tone. The squirrel should look like it belongs in an illustrated storybook, not a realistic photograph.
Question: Does the squirrel have a whimsical, cartoon-style appearance consistent with a children's book character?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
