      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the entire scene into an eco-friendly tea brand packaging concept. This implies a shift from a realistic tea ceremony setting to a stylized product presentation. Key indicators include visual framing as packaging, branding elements, and materials suggesting sustainability. The core of this requirement is whether the overall composition now functions as a conceptual package design rather than a traditional scene.",
      "question": "Is the entire scene reimagined as a conceptual tea brand packaging design, where the original tea setup serves as part of the product presentation?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the table should be framed as a tea box lid with engraved leaf patterns. This means the wooden table must visually transform into a lid-like structure with visible engraving details resembling leaves. The transformation must be clear enough to interpret it as a box lid, not just a table.",
      "question": "Is the central table redesigned to resemble a tea box lid with visible engraved leaf patterns on its surface?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The cups are to be replaced with illustrations of sustainable materials. This implies that the original ceramic cups are no longer present and instead shown as depictions of eco-materials such as bamboo, recycled paper, or bioplastics. These illustrations should be clearly distinguishable from real cups.",
      "question": "Are the original tea cups replaced with illustrated representations of sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled paper, or plant-based plastics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "A tag with the brand name \"Zen Autumn Tea\" in elegant calligraphy must be added. This requires a visible label or tag element bearing the exact text in a script style resembling traditional calligraphy. The placement should be prominent but integrated naturally into the packaging concept.",
      "question": "Is there a visible tag displaying the text \"Zen Autumn Tea\" written in elegant calligraphy style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The teapot must be depicted within a leaf-shaped contour with subtle earthy textures to convey an organic, natural aesthetic. This means the teapot's outline should follow the shape of a leaf, and its surface should feature textures resembling soil, bark, or natural fibers, distinct from the original metallic appearance.",
      "question": "Is the teapot enclosed within a leaf-shaped silhouette and rendered with subtle earthy textures such as wood grain or soil tones to suggest organic origin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
