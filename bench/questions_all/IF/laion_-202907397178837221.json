      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires converting the urban skyline into a futuristic digital display mural. This implies that the buildings should no longer appear as traditional architectural structures but instead resemble illuminated digital displays. A key observable feature is whether the building surfaces show pixel-like patterns or grid-based luminous textures, indicating a digital aesthetic.",
      "question": "Are the buildings in the skyline rendered with pixel-patterned or grid-like luminous facades resembling a digital display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that buildings must be fused into luminescent towers. This means they should emit light and have a glowing appearance, possibly with dynamic color shifts or internal illumination. The presence of visible glow effects around or within the buildings indicates compliance.",
      "question": "Do the buildings exhibit a glowing or luminescent effect, such as bright edges, internal illumination, or radiant colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Trees are to be transformed into glowing, angular digital circuits. This transformation implies that natural foliage should be replaced with geometric, wireframe-like structures emitting light, resembling electronic circuitry. The visual style should shift from organic to synthetic and technological.",
      "question": "Have the trees been replaced with glowing, angular, circuit-like structures composed of lines and nodes resembling digital pathways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The bridge must become a vibrant neon-lit pathway. This involves replacing its current material appearance with bright, colorful neon lighting along its surface and supports. The pathway should visually stand out with strong luminance and possibly multiple colors typical of neon signs.",
      "question": "Is the bridge illuminated with vibrant neon lights along its structure, creating a glowing pathway effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for integrating futuristic technology aesthetics. This includes elements such as digital textures, glowing components, circuitry motifs, and high-tech design language across all modified elements. The overall scene should convey a sense of advanced technology through consistent visual themes.",
      "question": "Does the entire scene consistently feature futuristic technology aesthetics, such as digital patterns, glowing elements, and cybernetic design features across buildings, trees, and infrastructure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
