Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the male’s tee should be transformed into a plush 3D style with a bold geometric pattern and enlarged collar. This requires assessing whether the shirt has a textured, three-dimensional appearance, features distinct geometric shapes (e.g., triangles, squares), and an oversized or stylized collar typical of chibi designs.
Question: Does the male character's tee have a plush 3D appearance with a bold geometric pattern and an enlarged collar?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The male’s pants must also be transformed into a plush 3D style with a bold geometric pattern. This involves checking if the pants appear soft, voluminous, and feature clear geometric designs consistent with the tee.
Question: Are the male character's pants rendered in a plush 3D style with a bold geometric pattern?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The female’s high-waisted pants need to have exaggerated pleats, meaning they should appear more voluminous, with deep, prominent folds than normal. This is a structural change visible in the silhouette and texture of the pants.
Question: Do the female character's high-waisted pants feature exaggerated, prominent pleats?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The female’s top sleeve must be enlarged, which implies it should appear wider, longer, or puffed compared to standard proportions. This is a specific modification to the garment's shape.
Question: Is the sleeve of the female character's top visibly enlarged compared to normal proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Both characters must be stylized as chibi-style figurines, which typically includes large heads, small bodies, simplified features, and cartoonish proportions. They should also be depicted dancing on a pastel-colored stage, requiring a change in scale, perspective, and background.
Question: Are both characters rendered as chibi-style figurines with large heads, small bodies, and cartoonish proportions, dancing on a pastel-colored stage?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The overall scene must convey playful elegance, which can be evaluated through the characters’ poses (graceful dance movements), facial expressions (smiling, joyful), and the soft, pastel environment. These elements together create a lighthearted yet refined aesthetic.
Question: Do the characters exhibit graceful dance poses, joyful expressions, and are placed on a pastel-colored stage, conveying playful elegance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
