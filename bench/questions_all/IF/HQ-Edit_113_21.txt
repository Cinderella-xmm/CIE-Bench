- Create a series of three art postcards featuring the woman in vibrant African attire
- First postcard: woman leaning against a straw hut
- Second postcard: emphasize her beaded jewelry in abstract form
- Third postcard: showcase her silhouette against a digital grassy landscape
- Use vivid colors throughout all postcards
- Apply geometric borders to each postcard for visual cohesion
- Maintain the woman’s traditional attire and cultural elements
- Ensure each postcard is distinct in composition and style as per specified themes

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires creating three distinct postcards. This means the final output must contain exactly three separate images, each corresponding to one of the described scenes. The presence of only one image or more than three would violate this requirement.
Question: Does the edited version contain exactly three distinct art postcards?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The first postcard must feature the woman leaning against a straw hut. This implies a clear depiction of the woman in a relaxed pose with physical contact (e.g., leaning) against a structure made of straw or thatched material. The background should reflect a rural or traditional setting consistent with such architecture.
Question: Is there a postcard showing the woman leaning against a straw hut?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The second postcard must emphasize the woman's beaded jewelry in an abstract form. This means the jewelry should not be depicted realistically but rather transformed into stylized, non-literal shapes—possibly using color fields, patterns, or geometric abstraction—while still being recognizable as beadwork.
Question: Is there a postcard where the woman's beaded jewelry is represented in an abstract, non-realistic style?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The third postcard must show the woman’s silhouette against a digital grassy landscape. This requires a clear silhouette (dark outline) of the woman set against a background that combines natural grassland elements with digital aesthetics—such as pixelation, glowing lines, or grid patterns—indicating a fusion of nature and technology.
Question: Is there a postcard showing the woman’s silhouette against a digitally rendered grassy landscape?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instructions specify the use of vivid colors and geometric borders across all postcards to create a cohesive set. Therefore, each postcard must display bright, saturated colors and be framed by clearly defined geometric patterns (e.g., triangles, diamonds, stripes) around the edges.
Question: Do all three postcards feature vivid colors and geometric borders?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
