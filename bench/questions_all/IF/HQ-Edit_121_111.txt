Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies a "soft, watercolor aesthetic with pastel tones" to create a dreamy atmosphere. This implies visible brushstroke textures, translucent layering, and muted color saturation typical of watercolor paintings. The overall tone should not be sharp or digital but soft and blended.
Question: Does the image exhibit a soft, watercolor-like texture with blended pastel colors throughout the scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires adding "vibrant splashes of light pink and pale yellow" to the squirrel's fur. These colors must be visibly present as highlights or patches within the fur, not just subtly tinted, to convey a magical effect.
Question: Are there distinct areas of light pink and pale yellow coloration visible on the squirrelâ€™s fur?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The addition of "tiny wings" is explicitly required to make the squirrel appear mythical. These wings should be small, delicate, and likely semi-transparent or feathery in appearance, positioned near the back or shoulders.
Question: Does the squirrel have small, delicate wings attached to its body?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: All acorns in the original image must be replaced with sparkling jewels. This means no acorns should remain; instead, each one should be substituted with a gem-like object that reflects light and has facets or shine.
Question: Have all acorns in the image been replaced with sparkling, gem-like objects?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The grassy backdrop must be gently blurred and transformed into a fairytale forest, implying softer focus, ethereal lighting, and possibly stylized trees or glowing elements to enhance fantasy.
Question: Is the background of the image softly blurred and rendered as a fantastical forest with dreamlike qualities?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The text "The Jewel Gatherer of Whispering Woods" must be embedded whimsically in the sky. This means the phrase should be visible in the sky area, styled in a playful, cursive, or decorative font, and integrated naturally into the scene (e.g., floating clouds or glowing letters).
Question: Is the phrase "The Jewel Gatherer of Whispering Woods" visible in the sky, written in a whimsical, decorative style?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
