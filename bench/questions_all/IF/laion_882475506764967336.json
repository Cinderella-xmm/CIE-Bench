      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the entire patio furniture into LEGO block structures. This means that the original wood texture must be replaced with LEGO brick patterns, including visible studs and modular construction. The transformation should preserve the general shape but clearly indicate LEGO material.",
      "question": "Are the table and chairs visibly constructed from LEGO bricks with interlocking patterns and stud details?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies creating interlocking surfaces for the tabletop and seating areas. This implies that the top of the table and the seats of the chairs must show LEGO-style brick connections, such as horizontal rows of bricks with visible gaps or studs indicating assembly.",
      "question": "Do the tabletop and chair seats feature interlocking LEGO brick patterns consistent with modular construction?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly states to add LEGO plant elements in the center. These should resemble LEGO flora, such as green stem-and-leaf pieces, possibly with flowers or foliage made from LEGO parts, placed where the glass bowl currently is.",
      "question": "Is there a LEGO-style plant element placed in the center of the table?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires placing the entire set on a simplified gray LEGO baseplate. This means the ground beneath the furniture should be a flat, uniform gray surface resembling a LEGO baseplate, replacing the concrete patio seen in the original image.",
      "question": "Is the furniture placed on a flat, gray LEGO baseplate that replaces the original concrete patio?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction says to leave the surrounding environment uncluttered. This means any background elements such as the wooden fence, potted plants, garden lights, and children’s play equipment must be removed or simplified to maintain focus on the LEGO furniture.",
      "question": "Are background elements like the wooden fence, potted plants, and outdoor lighting removed or simplified to create a clean, uncluttered environment?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies using only brown and amber LEGO bricks. This means no other colors should appear in the furniture structure—any deviation would violate the color constraint.",
      "question": "Are all LEGO bricks used in the furniture exclusively brown and amber in color?",

        "Yes",
