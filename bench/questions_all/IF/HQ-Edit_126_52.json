This involves changing both the material and appearance of the spines—shifting from organic, yellowish needles to translucent, reflective crystalline structures that emit a subtle glow. This is a clear visual replacement task.",

These should be visible symbols or patterns that emit light, likely etched or embedded into the cactus skin, consistent with magical or ancient inscriptions. Their presence must be observable as glowing marks.",

      "thinking_process": "The terracotta pot must be reshaped into a sandstone pedestal. This implies a change in material (from clay to stone), texture (rougher, porous sandstone), and possibly shape (more ornate, elevated base resembling a monument or altar). The new structure must clearly resemble a natural stone pedestal rather than a ceramic pot.",

This includes thin, winding plant stems wrapping around the base of the pedestal, with tiny blooms typical of desert flora such as daisy-like or star-shaped flowers. The vines should appear organic and fragile, contrasting with the stony pedestal.",

      "thinking_process": "The overall transformation into an \"enchanted desert guardian creature\" implies that the cactus no longer appears ordinary—it should convey magic, life, and purpose. This is supported by the combination of glowing elements (crystals, glyphs, eyes), symbolic features (tendrils, pedestal), and a sense of sentience. While subjective, this can be evaluated through the presence of all previously listed features together.",
