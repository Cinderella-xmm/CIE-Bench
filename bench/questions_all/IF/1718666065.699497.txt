Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the unicorn into a ceramic sculpture with a smooth, glazed surface in creamy white. This requires evaluating whether the entire body of the unicorn now appears non-furry, uniformly glazed, and in a creamy white color, consistent with ceramic material rather than organic fur.
Question: Is the unicorn's body rendered with a smooth, glazed, creamy white ceramic surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The original mane and tail are replaced with porcelain curls, which implies they should no longer resemble natural hair but instead appear as delicate, sculpted, curl-shaped elements made of porcelain—likely with a glossy finish and fine detail.
Question: Are the mane and tail replaced with delicate, curl-shaped porcelain elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The horn is explicitly described as a polished metallic spiral, meaning it should no longer be a single straight horn but instead have a coiled or helical structure with reflective metallic properties (e.g., silver, chrome, or gold-like shine).
Question: Is the unicorn’s horn a polished metallic spiral?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The scene must be changed to a minimalist gallery setting, which implies a clean, uncluttered environment with neutral walls, soft lighting, and possibly a display pedestal—contrasting sharply with the original dark forest background.
Question: Is the background a minimalist gallery setting with neutral tones and no forest elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A gently textured stone base is required to support the sculpture and enhance its mythical elegance. This means the unicorn must stand on a visible stone platform with subtle texture, not bare ground or forest floor.
Question: Does the unicorn stand on a gently textured stone base?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
