```
- Create a three-panel card set
- Central panel: cartoonize her gently turning book pages
- Left panel: focus on her hand morphed into a tree branch
- Right panel: show floral embellishments brightening the bench
- Use soft pastel paper with textural leaf-patterned edges
- Maintain the original subject (elderly woman reading) within the composition
- Ensure panels are clearly separated and arranged in a triptych format
- The transformation should be stylized but recognizable, preserving key features like facial expression and posture

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating a three-panel card set. This implies the final image must be divided into three distinct vertical or horizontal panels. The presence of three clearly demarcated sections is essential to satisfy this requirement.
Question: Is the edited image composed of three distinct panels arranged side by side or in a triptych layout?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The central panel must depict a cartoonized version of the woman gently turning book pages. "Cartoonize" implies stylistic simplification—such as exaggerated outlines, flat colors, or playful line work—while retaining the action of page-turning. The gesture must remain recognizable.
Question: Does the central panel show a cartoon-style depiction of the woman’s hands turning the pages of the book?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The left panel must feature her hand transformed into a tree branch. This requires a clear visual metamorphosis—fingers blending into bark, veins resembling branches, etc.—while maintaining the general shape and position of the hand.
Question: Does the left panel display a morphed version of her hand that transitions into a tree branch structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The right panel must include floral embellishments that brighten the bench. This means decorative flowers or blossoms added to or around the bench, enhancing its appearance with color and detail, likely in a stylized manner.
Question: Does the right panel show floral elements such as flowers or vines decorating or brightening the bench?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies using soft pastel paper with textural leaf-patterned edges. This refers to the background or surface material of the panels—soft pastel tones (e.g., pale pink, mint, lavender) and visible leaf-like textures along the borders of each panel.
Question: Are the panels rendered on soft pastel-colored paper with visible leaf-patterned textures along their edges?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The original subject—the elderly woman reading—must be preserved across the panels, even if stylized. Her face, posture, clothing, and the book should remain identifiable, especially in the central panel.
Question: Is the elderly woman still recognizable in at least the central panel, with her facial features, glasses, and book clearly present?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
