-Show the parking meter standing alone in the heat haze
-Include visible effects of heat haze such as blurring and shimmering
-Ensure the desert highway is depicted accurately with sand and sparse vegetation

Q1：
Thinking process: The core requirement here is to ensure the background has been replaced. We need to verify the change from a city street to a desert highway.
Question: Has the city street background been replaced with a desert highway?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the parking meter should remain in the foreground. It’s crucial to verify that the parking meter hasn’t been altered or removed.
Question: Is the parking meter still in the foreground, maintaining its original position relative to the new background?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The concept of heat haze involves visual effects like blurring and shimmering, indicating heat in a desert environment. This needs to be observed in the edited image.
Question: Are there visible effects of heat haze, such as blurring and shimmering around the parking meter and the surrounding area?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The parking meter is described as standing alone, implying no additional objects or elements are near it within the desert scene.
Question: Is the parking meter standing alone without any nearby objects or irrelevant elements in the new desert highway setting?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A desert highway typically includes sand and sparse vegetation. This should be observed in the background to confirm the transformation matches the desired environment.
Question: Does the desert highway include sand and sparse vegetation in the background?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
