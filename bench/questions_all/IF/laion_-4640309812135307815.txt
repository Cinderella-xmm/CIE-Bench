Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the dress into a translucent red-tinted glass flacon. This implies replacing the fabric dress with a transparent or semi-transparent glass-like material with a red tint, preserving the general shape but changing the material appearance. The key observable feature is whether the dress has been replaced with a glass-like object with red translucency.
Question: Has the dress been transformed into a translucent red-tinted glass flacon?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that petal motifs should be embossed across the surface of the flacon. This means the red petals from the original dress must now appear as raised or textured patterns on the glass surface, not just as flat decorations. The presence of 3D-like petal textures on the bottle’s surface is essential.
Question: Are petal motifs embossed across the surface of the flacon?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The cap of the fragrance bottle must resemble a stylized red flower. This implies a floral-shaped top element that is distinct from the body of the bottle, made in a red tone, and designed to look like a flower—possibly with layered petals—rather than a simple lid.
Question: Does the bottle have an elegant cap resembling a stylized red flower?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A metallic label with a cursive brand signature must be added. This requires a visible label on the bottle (likely near the neck or midsection) that appears metallic in finish and contains handwritten-style text. The label should be clearly readable and stylistically consistent with high fashion branding.
Question: Is there a metallic label with a cursive brand signature on the bottle?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The bottle must maintain a sleek, elongated shape that mimics the silhouette of the original dress. This includes preserving the long, flowing form, especially the train and vertical linearity, ensuring it reflects the dress’s contours in a liquid glass format.
Question: Does the bottle maintain a sleek, elongated shape that mirrors the silhouette of the original dress?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
