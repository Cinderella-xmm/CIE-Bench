      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires the entire pickup truck to be transformed into a LEGO model. This means all visible surfaces of the truck—body, doors, windows, roof, etc.—must be constructed from identifiable LEGO bricks. The materials must appear modular, with visible interlocking patterns typical of LEGO construction.",
      "question": "Is the entire body of the truck constructed from visible LEGO bricks in orange, black, and silver colors?",

      "question": "Are the wheels composed entirely of circular gray LEGO pieces, replacing the original tire and rim design?",
