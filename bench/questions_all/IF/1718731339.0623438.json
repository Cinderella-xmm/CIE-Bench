      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires the armored figure to be converted into a miniaturized sculpture. This implies a significant reduction in scale, visible proportionally smaller than original size, and likely displayed as an object rather than a full-sized entity. The term \"miniaturized\" suggests a clear change in scale relative to the original image.",
      "question": "Is the armored figure visibly smaller in scale compared to its original form, consistent with being a miniature sculpture?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "A steampunk-style glass dome must be present, which includes transparent or semi-transparent glass enclosure with metallic (likely brass or copper) framework, rivets, gears, or other industrial elements typical of steampunk aesthetics. The dome should fully encase the figure.",
      "question": "Is the armored figure enclosed within a transparent dome featuring metallic structural elements consistent with steampunk design?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Rotating cogwheels at the base imply functional-looking gears that are positioned beneath the dome, possibly part of a mechanical platform. These should be clearly visible and appear to be in motion or designed to rotate.",
      "question": "Are there visible rotating cogwheels located at the base of the structure beneath the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Small mechanical wings on the back of the figure must be added. These should be metallic, gear-like, or articulated in appearance, and attached to the armor's backplate. They should not be natural wings but constructed from mechanical parts.",
      "question": "Are there small mechanical wings attached to the back of the armored figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Intricate copper piping accents must be added to the armor. Copper is reddish-brown in color and should contrast with the gray metallic armor. These pipes should follow seams or contours of the armor and appear integrated into the design.",
      "question": "Are there visible copper-colored piping details integrated into the surface of the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Suspended brass filigree orbs must surround the figure, resembling planets. These should be spherical, made of brass or gold-toned material, with delicate patterns (filigree), and appear to float in space around the dome.",
      "question": "Are there multiple spherical brass filigree objects suspended in the air around the figure, mimicking planetary orbits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The mystical atmosphere is enhanced by the presence of the orbs and overall composition. This can be evaluated by whether the lighting, positioning of orbs, and integration of mechanical and celestial elements create a sense of wonder or fantasy. While subjective, it can be assessed objectively by presence of key elements like floating orbs, warm glow, and harmonious layout.",
      "question": "Are the brass filigree orbs arranged in a way that creates a sense of orbiting celestial bodies, contributing to a mystical ambiance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
