Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating a "limited-edition art print on textured canvas." This implies the final output should simulate or visually represent a physical canvas texture, not a smooth digital rendering. Textured canvas is a material attribute that affects surface appearance—visible grain, weave, or tactile depth must be present.
Question: Is the surface of the image rendered with a visible textured canvas effect, such as fabric-like weave or uneven surface detail?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The woolen cardigan must have "exaggerated knitted textures," meaning the knit pattern should be more pronounced than realistic—larger stitches, deeper shadows, or enhanced relief—to emphasize its handmade quality. This is a specific visual exaggeration of textile detail.
Question: Are the knit patterns on the cardigan visibly exaggerated, with enhanced depth, contrast, or stitch definition compared to normal knitting?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The buttons are explicitly stated to be "focal points in metallic hues." This means they must stand out due to reflective properties, color (e.g., gold, silver, bronze), and possibly light interaction like highlights or glints, distinguishing them from the rest of the garment.
Question: Do the buttons on the cardigan exhibit metallic sheen or reflective qualities, such as highlights, shine, or a non-matte finish?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The image must be "rendered in soft, warm tones" to harmonize with the vintage floral wallpaper. Warm tones include shades of amber, terracotta, golden yellow, or soft browns; the lighting should lack harsh contrasts and instead feature diffused illumination.
Question: Does the overall color palette of the image use soft, warm tones (such as muted golds, creams, or earthy browns) rather than cool or neutral colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: "Detailed embroidery to the frame" refers to decorative stitching or ornamental patterns applied directly to the frame surrounding the artwork. This is a finishing touch meant to enhance elegance and suggest handcrafted artistry.
Question: Is there visible detailed embroidery or decorative stitching along the edges of the frame surrounding the portrait?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The original subject—the man wearing the cardigan—must remain intact and recognizable, even after artistic modifications. Changes should not distort facial features, posture, or identity beyond recognition.
Question: Is the man’s face, hair, glasses, and general posture clearly preserved and unchanged from the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
