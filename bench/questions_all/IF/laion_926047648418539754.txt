Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire image into a 1920s Art Deco fashion illustration. This implies a shift from photographic realism to stylized line art with strong outlines, flat colors, and decorative elements typical of the era. The visual style must include clean lines, symmetry, and an illustrative quality rather than photorealism.
Question: Is the overall image rendered in a stylized, illustrative manner consistent with 1920s Art Deco fashion illustrations?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The original dress is a modern black mini dress with puffed sleeves. The instruction specifies changing it into a flapper-style dress with fringe and geometric patterns. Flapper dresses are characterized by dropped waistlines, straight silhouettes, and decorative fringe or sequins arranged in geometric motifs.
Question: Does the dress feature a flapper-style silhouette with geometric patterns and fringe along the hem or edges?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The original bag is a leopard-print pouch with pearl tassels. The instruction requires converting it into a beaded clutch appropriate for the 1920s. Beaded clutches from that era typically feature intricate beadwork, symmetrical designs, and often have a rectangular or rounded shape with no straps or short chains.
Question: Has the bag been replaced with a beaded clutch featuring detailed beadwork and a design consistent with 1920s fashion?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The original footwear consists of chunky platform heels. The instruction calls for replacing them with elegant T-strap shoes, which were iconic in the 1920s. T-strap shoes have a strap across the instep forming a "T" shape and are typically low to medium heel height, sleek, and made of leather or patent material.
Question: Are the shoes now T-strap style with a refined, vintage design suitable for the 1920s?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The original background is plain white. The instruction specifies stylizing it with bold, linear Art Deco designs in gold and black. Art Deco backgrounds often feature zigzags, chevrons, sunbursts, stepped forms, and repeating geometric patterns in high-contrast color schemes.
Question: Does the background feature bold, linear geometric patterns in gold and black, characteristic of Art Deco design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
