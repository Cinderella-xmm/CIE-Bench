    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The original image shows white gloves; the instruction specifies replacing them with leather gauntlets. Leather gauntlets are distinct in material and shape—typically extending up the forearm with visible stitching or rivets—and must clearly differ from the original gloves.",
      "question": "Are the white gloves replaced with leather gauntlets?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction mandates changing Santa’s red suit to an 18th-century explorer coat with leather details. This implies a change in color (from red to darker, historical tones like brown or navy), style (long coat with lapels, buttons), and inclusion of leather elements such as trim, cuffs, or straps.",
      "question": "Has the red Santa suit been replaced with a period-appropriate explorer coat featuring leather details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The background must be changed from bare trees and blue sky to a rugged, snowy mountain landscape. This includes visible snow-covered peaks, rocky terrain, and possibly cold lighting to suggest high-altitude conditions.",
      "question": "Is the background now a rugged, snowy mountain landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for a scene that embodies adventure and historical exploration. This can be evaluated by observing environmental cues such as harsh weather, elevation, distant peaks, or signs of travel (e.g., backpack, map, or compass). The presence of these elements supports the thematic shift.",
      "question": "Does the scene include visual elements that convey adventure and historical exploration (such as snow, mountains, or explorer gear)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Although not explicitly stated, maintaining the character’s identity (including facial features like glasses, beard, and expression) is implied. The transformation should not alter the core identity of the figure beyond clothing and setting.",
      "question": "Has the character’s facial features, including glasses, beard, and expression, remained unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The original image shows Santa with his right arm extended outward. The instruction does not mention altering posture, so the gesture should remain consistent to preserve continuity.",
      "question": "Is the character’s arm still extended in the same position as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
