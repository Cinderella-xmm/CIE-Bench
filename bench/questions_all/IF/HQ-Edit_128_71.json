      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the Statue of Liberty must be enclosed within a vintage glass lantern. This implies the presence of a transparent, ornate glass structure with a classic design (such as brass fittings, aged metal frame, or decorative finial) surrounding the statue. The lantern should be visibly enclosing the statue, not merely adjacent to it.",
      "question": "Is the Statue of Liberty fully enclosed within a vintage-style glass lantern?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires the statue to have verdigris and copper-hued patinas. Verdigris is a greenish-blue patina typically seen on aged copper, while copper hues suggest warm reddish-brown tones. Both color effects should be visible on the statueâ€™s surface, especially on exposed areas like the torch, crown, and robe folds.",
      "question": "Does the Statue of Liberty display both verdigris (greenish-blue) and copper-hued (reddish-brown) patinas on its surface?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "A pastel skyline is explicitly mentioned as the backdrop. This means the background sky should feature soft, muted colors such as pale pink, lavender, mint green, or light blue, resembling a tranquil dawn or dusk setting. It should not be a clear bright blue or dark night sky.",
      "question": "Is the background sky rendered in soft pastel colors such as pale pink, lavender, or mint green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for tiny ships and waves beneath the statue to provide maritime context. These elements must be clearly visible at the base of the diorama, small in scale relative to the statue, and depict water with ripples or waves and one or more miniature ships sailing on it.",
      "question": "Are there tiny ships and wave patterns visible beneath the Statue of Liberty in the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies a revolving mechanism at the base, which suggests a mechanical component such as gears, a rotating platform, or a visible axis allowing the entire diorama or statue to spin. This feature should be visually implied or present to convey dynamic display capability.",
      "question": "Is there a visible revolving mechanism (e.g., rotating base, gears, or central axis) at the foundation of the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The phrase \"emphasize the grandeur in a compact form\" implies that despite the miniature scale, the statue should retain its iconic proportions, details, and imposing presence. The overall composition should balance small size with visual impact through lighting, detail, and framing.",
      "question": "Does the diorama maintain the recognizable grandeur and detailed features of the Statue of Liberty despite being miniature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
