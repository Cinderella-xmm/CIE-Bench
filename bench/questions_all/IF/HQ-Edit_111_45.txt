Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire scene into a Middle Ages illuminated manuscript style. This involves specific visual characteristics such as flat, stylized figures, gold leaf accents, decorative borders, and a two-dimensional composition typical of medieval manuscripts. The overall aesthetic must resemble a page from a religious or historical manuscript rather than a realistic depiction.
Question: Is the entire scene rendered in a flat, stylized manner consistent with a medieval illuminated manuscript, including use of gold highlights and non-realistic proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: A key requirement is the addition of a golden halo around the central figure to signify sainthood. In illuminated manuscripts, halos are typically circular, radiant, and made of gold or yellow tones, often with fine detailing to suggest light emanation.
Question: Does the central figure have a clearly visible golden halo surrounding their head?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The original image shows the blacksmith in practical work attire. The instruction specifies changing this to flowing medieval robes that convey sanctity and divinity. These robes should be draped with soft folds and possibly include religious symbols or patterns typical of saints in manuscripts.
Question: Is the central figure wearing long, flowing medieval-style robes with soft drapery instead of a simple apron and tunic?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The tools (hammer and tongs) must be transformed into divine instruments—this implies symbolic or supernatural elements such as crosses, flames, or celestial motifs integrated into the tools. They should no longer look like mundane metalworking tools.
Question: Have the hammer and tongs been replaced or modified to appear as divine or sacred instruments, such as incorporating religious symbols or glowing elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The forge must be stylized as an ethereal furnace with glowing embers. This means the fire should not look like real flames but rather luminous, magical light with soft glows, possibly floating particles, and an otherworldly appearance consistent with manuscript art.
Question: Is the forge depicted as a glowing, ethereal furnace with radiant embers and no realistic fire or smoke?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Entwining vine borders are a hallmark of illuminated manuscripts, often framing the image with decorative plant motifs. These should run along the edges of the scene, forming a continuous border.
Question: Are there decorative entwining vine borders running along the edges of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: Ornate calligraphy inscribing the edges is a defining feature of illuminated manuscripts. This includes stylized script, possibly Latin or Old English, with flourishes and possibly initial letters, placed along the margins.
Question: Are the edges of the image inscribed with ornate, stylized calligraphy typical of medieval manuscripts?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
