Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction clearly states that the word "Draft" should be handwritten. We need to confirm if the text appears to be handwritten rather than typed or digitally inserted.
Question: Is the word “Draft” written in a handwritten font?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Thinking process: The instructions specify that the word “Draft” should be placed on the yellow paper. We need to verify if the text is indeed positioned over the yellow sheet.
Question: Is the word “Draft” placed on the yellow paper?

Q3:
Thinking process: To assess if the image serves as a design sketch cover, evaluate whether the overall presentation matches what one would expect from a design sketch cover (e.g., simplicity, focus on the central element).
Question: Does the image resemble a design sketch cover focused on presenting the word “Draft”?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instructions do not specify any additional formatting or size but require clear visibility of the word “Draft.” We need to verify if the text is legible and prominent.

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction implies that the overall design should maintain a minimalistic approach suitable for a draft cover. Confirm that no extraneous elements distract from the primary focus.
