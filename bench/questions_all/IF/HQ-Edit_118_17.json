      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires encasing the stave church in a detailed glass display case, which implies the presence of transparent glass walls and possibly a frame or base structure. This transformation should make the entire scene appear as a scaled-down model contained within a protective enclosure. The glass must be visibly present and detailed enough to suggest realism.",
      "question": "Is the stave church enclosed within a transparent glass display case with visible structural framing?",

      "thinking_process": "\"Layered, wispy clouds\" refers to multiple cloud layers with soft, feathery textures that appear in the background behind the display case. These should not be solid or dense but rather ethereal and atmospheric, suggesting depth and sky-like qualities.",
      "question": "Are there multiple layers of soft, wispy clouds visible in the background panel behind the display case?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies sculpting tiny coniferous trees around the base of the display case. These trees must be smaller in scale than the original surrounding forest, consistent with a miniature setting, and placed directly at the foundation level of the case.",
      "question": "Are small-scale coniferous trees positioned around the base of the glass display case?",

      "thinking_process": "A muted color scheme for the mountain backdrop means reduced saturation and contrast in the mountain colors—likely desaturated greens, grays, and browns—creating a subdued, aged appearance that complements the vintage architectural style.",
      "question": "Do the mountains in the background feature a desaturated, low-contrast color palette consistent with a muted tone?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Molded rocky terrain surrounding the base indicates artificial-looking rocks shaped to form a naturalistic ground cover around the display case, simulating a rugged landscape. This should be distinct from the original grassy or forested terrain.",
      "question": "Is there sculpted rocky terrain forming a border around the base of the glass display case?",

      "thinking_process": "Faint footprint imprints on a simulated snowy surface path imply a narrow trail made of white or light gray material resembling snow, with subtle indentations suggesting footprints leading toward the church entrance. These should be visible but not overly prominent.",
      "question": "Is there a simulated snowy path with faint footprint imprints leading up to the entrance of the stave church?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The vintage architectural style must be preserved despite the miniaturization. This includes maintaining intricate wood carvings, traditional gabled roof design, dragon-head finials, and overall historical authenticity of the stave church.",
      "question": "Does the stave church retain its original architectural details such as carved wooden elements, multiple gables, and dragon-shaped roof ornaments?",

        "Yes",
