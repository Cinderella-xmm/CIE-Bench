Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the scene into a vintage-style theater program cover. This implies a shift from a realistic photograph-like representation to a stylized, graphic design format typical of old theater programs—characterized by flat areas of color, decorative borders, and text integration. The overall composition should resemble a printed cover rather than a live scene.
Question: Is the image styled as a vintage theater program cover, with a flattened, illustrative appearance resembling a printed poster?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The chandelier must be enhanced with ornate detailing, meaning additional decorative elements such as filigree, scrollwork, or embellished candle arms should be visibly added beyond its original form. These details should stand out due to increased intricacy.
Question: Has the chandelier been modified to include additional ornate decorative elements such as scrollwork or intricate metalwork?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The ceiling is instructed to have intricate patterns added. This means visible geometric, floral, or classical motifs should now cover parts of the ceiling that were previously plain or less detailed, especially around the central dome.
Question: Are there newly added intricate patterns (such as floral or geometric designs) on the ceiling surface, particularly surrounding the central dome?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The audience must be simplified into silhouette figures. This means all individual facial features, clothing textures, and distinct postures should be removed or replaced with solid dark shapes, preserving only general human forms.
Question: Have all audience members been rendered as solid black or dark silhouettes without visible facial features or clothing details?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A sepia-toned color palette is required to evoke nostalgia. This means the entire image should be desaturated toward warm brownish-yellow tones, with no strong blues, greens, or vibrant colors remaining.
Question: Does the entire image exhibit a consistent sepia tone, with dominant warm brown and yellow hues and minimal contrast from cooler colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The grand piano must be framed as the central motif, meaning it should occupy a prominent position in the foreground, possibly centered and larger in scale relative to other elements, drawing immediate visual attention.
Question: Is the grand piano positioned centrally in the foreground and visually emphasized as the primary focal point of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The text “AN EVENING OF CLASSICAL MAJESTY” must appear in elegant serif typography at the top. This requires the presence of readable text using a classic serif font (e.g., Times New Roman, Garamond), placed near the upper edge of the image.
Question: Is the phrase “AN EVENING OF CLASSICAL MAJESTY” present at the top of the image in a serif font style?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
