Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the woman into a stylized cartoon form. This implies simplification of facial features, exaggerated proportions, and smooth outlines typical of cartoon styles. The background bamboo should also be rendered in a cartoonish manner, not photorealistic.
Question: Is the woman depicted in a stylized cartoon form with simplified features and exaggerated proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The floral embroidery on the dress must be enlarged and enhanced with gold highlights. This means the flowers should be visibly larger than in the original and have distinct golden outlines or accents to emphasize them.
Question: Are the floral patterns on the dress visibly enlarged and accented with gold highlights?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The dress is required to have radiant hues, meaning the colors should appear luminous, vibrant, or glowing, possibly through added light effects or color saturation.
Question: Does the dress exhibit radiant or luminous color tones, such as glowing or highly saturated hues?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Abstract bamboo shadows are meant to add depth. These should not be realistic shadows but rather artistic, stylized silhouettes or layered forms that suggest depth without being literal.
Question: Are abstract, non-realistic bamboo shadows present in the image to enhance depth?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A blank bamboo-shaped writing panel must be included, framed by soft watercolor bamboo motifs. This panel should be clearly visible, shaped like bamboo, and surrounded by delicate watercolor-style bamboo designs.
Question: Is there a blank, bamboo-shaped writing panel framed by soft watercolor bamboo motifs in the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
