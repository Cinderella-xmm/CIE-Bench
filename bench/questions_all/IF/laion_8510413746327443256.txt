Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire smartwatch into a cybernetic wrist dragon. This implies a complete morphological shift from a standard wearable device to a biomechanical creature-like form, with organic and mechanical fusion elements. Key indicators include dragon-like features such as limbs, wings, or head structure integrated into the wrist form, and a non-humanoid aesthetic.
Question: Does the edited image show the smartwatch transformed into a full cybernetic wrist dragon with dragon-like anatomy integrated into the wrist?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The watch face must be replaced with a radiant, holographic dragon eye. A "holographic" effect implies depth, light refraction, and possibly animated or layered visual components. A "dragon eye" suggests an iris with intricate patterns, possibly glowing, and a pupil that may resemble a slit or other mythical design.
Question: Is the watch face replaced with a radiant, multi-layered holographic dragon eye featuring glowing elements and depth effects?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The band must be reimagined as segmented silver scales, suggesting a reptilian texture with metallic sheen and distinct segments. Each scale should have defined edges and reflective properties consistent with metal.
Question: Are the original silicone band and its contours replaced with a series of interlocking, metallic silver scales that cover the wrist portion?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The digital crown is specified to become a glowing neural node. This implies a transformation from a physical knob into a spherical or nodular structure emitting light, possibly with circuit-like patterns or pulsating energy effects, indicating technological integration.
Question: Has the digital crown been replaced with a glowing, spherical neural node emitting light or energy pulses, resembling a biotech interface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The screen icons (such as music, activity rings, and dB meter) must be enhanced into luminescent control sigils. These should appear as glowing symbols, possibly with arcane or futuristic runes, and emit light, reflecting a fusion of magic and technology.
Question: Are the original app icons on the watch face replaced with glowing, rune-like control sigils that emit light and reflect a tech-magic aesthetic?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The overall form must convey a dynamic, living presence—suggesting movement, energy flow, or an active state. This includes visual cues like motion blur, energy trails, or structural fluidity in the dragon’s form.
Question: Does the edited image display a dynamic form with visual cues such as energy flow, motion lines, or an active posture that conveys movement and life?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
