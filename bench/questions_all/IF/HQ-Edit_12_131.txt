Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating a digital character card in the style of an RPG collectible. This implies a rectangular card layout with visual elements typical of trading cards, such as borders, text fields, and structured presentation. The core requirement is whether the image has been transformed into a card format rather than just a standalone illustration.
Question: Is the image presented as a rectangular card with defined borders and structured layout resembling an RPG collectible?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The warrior must be identified as "Kaitiaki of the Valleys." This requires both the name to appear on the card and the character to be visually consistent with that identity. The name must be displayed in a clear, readable form, likely on a nameplate or title area.
Question: Is the name "Kaitiaki of the Valleys" displayed on the card, either in a nameplate or title area?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The original image features bold moko patterns. The instruction explicitly states these must be preserved. Moko refers to traditional Maori facial and body tattoos with intricate spiral and geometric designs. These must remain visible and intact in the edited version.
Question: Are the bold moko patterns on the warrior's face and body clearly visible and unchanged from the original?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The flax piupiu skirt is a key cultural element and must be retained. It is a traditional Maori skirt made of flax fibers, typically layered and fringed. Its presence confirms authenticity and adherence to the costume description.
Question: Is the flax piupiu skirt still present and accurately depicted on the warrior?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The wide haka stance is described as a defining pose. The haka involves strong, grounded posture with legs apart and arms extended. This must be maintained to reflect the warrior’s dynamic expression and cultural context.
Question: Is the warrior in a wide, dynamic stance with legs apart and arms outstretched, consistent with a haka pose?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies stylized 3D art with rich earthy tones. Earthy tones include browns, greens, ochres, and tans. Stylized 3D art suggests smooth rendering, depth, and lighting effects typical of digital modeling, not photorealistic or flat 2D styles.
Question: Does the artwork use a stylized 3D rendering style with rich earthy tones (e.g., deep greens, browns, tans) throughout the character and environment?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: A layered green-valley backdrop is required. This means the background should feature multiple layers of mountainous terrain covered in green vegetation, creating depth and perspective. It must not be flat or simplified.
Question: Is the background composed of a layered, lush green valley with visible depth and multiple mountain ridges?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: Stat bars are explicitly listed: [Courage +10], [Mana +9], [Rhythm +8], [Leadership +7]. These must appear as distinct, labeled attributes, likely in a row or column near the bottom or side of the card.
Question: Are four stat bars clearly visible with the labels [Courage +10], [Mana +9], [Rhythm +8], and [Leadership +7]?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q9:
Thinking process: A carved-wood title banner must be placed at the top. This implies a wooden texture, possibly with engraved lettering, positioned above the character, serving as a header.
Question: Is there a banner at the top of the card with a carved-wood appearance and text indicating the character's title?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q10:
Thinking process: A nameplate below the character is required. This would be a separate text box or label beneath the figure, displaying the character’s name.
Question: Is there a nameplate located below the warrior that displays the name "Kaitiaki of the Valleys"?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q11:
Thinking process: The card must be framed with polished metallic edges. This means the border of the card should have a reflective, metallic finish—such as silver, gold, or bronze—giving it a premium, collectible look.
Question: Does the card have a border with a polished metallic finish around its edges?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
