Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the church into a magical tower with swirling cloud-like structures. This implies that the original architectural form should be altered to include ethereal, non-solid, cloud-based elements in the structure or around it, suggesting a transformation from solid wood to a more fantastical, floating appearance. Observable features would include soft, billowing forms integrated into the tower’s design.
Question: Are there swirling cloud-like structures integrated into the tower's form or surrounding it?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Luminescent runes imply glowing inscriptions embedded within the wooden patterns of the building. These must be visible as distinct, illuminated symbols along the surface of the wood, not just painted or colored markings but clearly emitting light.
Question: Are there glowing runes visible along the wooden surfaces of the tower?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The roof must be replaced entirely with shimmering crystal spires. This means the original thatched or shingled roof is no longer present and has been substituted with transparent, faceted, and reflective crystal formations that appear to sparkle or refract light.
Question: Has the roof been replaced with shimmering crystal spires instead of wooden or thatched material?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The spire tops must be adorned with glowing celestial orbs. These are spherical objects at the peak of each spire that emit light, resembling stars, moons, or magical energy sources. Their presence must be visible at the highest points of the tower.
Question: Are there glowing orbs located at the top of each spire on the tower?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Trees in the image must be converted into mystical silver spirals. This means all trees—especially evergreens and surrounding foliage—should no longer have natural shapes but instead appear as metallic, spiral-shaped forms with a silvery color and possibly reflective or glowing qualities.
Question: Have all trees in the scene been transformed into silver spiral shapes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Ghostly bird apparitions must circle the tower. These are not real birds but translucent, spectral versions that appear to float or hover in motion around the structure, likely with faint outlines and semi-transparent bodies.
Question: Are there translucent, ghost-like birds circling the tower?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
