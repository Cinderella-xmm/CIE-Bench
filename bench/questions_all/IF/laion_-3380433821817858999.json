      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the image into a tutorial infographic. This implies the presence of multiple panels or sections showing different stages of the action. The original image is a single static figure, so the edit must include at least three distinct illustrated steps. The question checks whether the layout has been changed to reflect a multi-panel tutorial format.",
      "question": "Is the image now structured as a multi-panel infographic with at least three distinct steps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The first step explicitly states \"Positioning: Kneel with bent arms back\" and requires adding a simple figure in that pose. This means there should be a separate illustration showing a kneeling stance with arms pulled back. The question verifies if this specific pose is included and correctly labeled.",
      "question": "Is there a panel showing a simple figure in a kneeling position with bent arms pulled back, labeled as \"Step 1: Positioning: Kneel with bent arms back\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The second step describes \"Leap Attack: Propel using core strength\" and requires illustrating explosive movement. This implies dynamic motion lines, a forward-leaping posture, and visual cues of force or energy. The question checks whether this stage is depicted with appropriate action indicators.",
      "question": "Is there a panel showing an explosive leaping motion with visual cues of propulsion (e.g., motion lines, energy burst), labeled as \"Step 2: Leap Attack: Propel using core strength\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The third step specifies \"Mid-Air Adjustment: Tuck knees tightly\" and requires illustrating agility. This means the figure should be shown mid-air with knees tucked in, demonstrating control and balance. The question evaluates whether this pose is accurately represented.",
      "question": "Is there a panel showing the figure mid-air with knees tucked tightly, labeled as \"Step 3: Mid-Air Adjustment: Tuck knees tightly\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The design aesthetic calls for bold outlines, vibrant colors focused on blues and whites, and energetic fonts for captions. These are observable features: thick black outlines, dominant blue and white color scheme, and stylized text. The question assesses whether these stylistic elements are present across the entire infographic.",
      "question": "Are the illustrations rendered with bold outlines, vibrant blues and whites as dominant colors, and captions written in energetic, stylized fonts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
