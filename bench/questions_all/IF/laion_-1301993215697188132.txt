Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the human figure into a wise owl character. This involves changing facial features, body shape, and adding owl-specific traits such as feathers, beak, and eyes. The transformation must be complete and recognizable as an owl, not just partially altered.
Question: Has the speaking figure been fully transformed into a wise owl character with distinct owl features such as a beak, feathers, and large eyes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The original blue attire must be retained but adapted to resemble a feathered cloak. This means the clothing should still appear blue but have a textured, feathery appearance consistent with an owl's plumage while maintaining the general shape and color scheme.
Question: Is the blue attire replaced with a feathered cloak that retains the original blue color but has a textured, feather-like surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies adding small glasses perched firmly on the owl’s beak. This is a precise detail requiring visual confirmation of eyewear positioned correctly on the beak, not floating or misplaced.
Question: Are small glasses visibly present and securely placed on the owl’s beak?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The title "The Art of Public Speaking" must be clearly visible and centered at the top of the infographic. It should be legible and stylistically integrated into the design.
Question: Is the title "The Art of Public Speaking" displayed prominently at the top of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The hand gestures of the original figure must be reinterpreted as expressive wing movements. This implies that the hands are no longer visible as human limbs but have been transformed into wings in motion, conveying similar expressiveness.
Question: Have the hand gestures been replaced with expressive wing movements that mimic the original gesture's meaning?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Speech bubbles are required in the Tips section to emphasize articulation and clarity. These must contain relevant text and be visually distinct from other elements, placed near the owl or within the infographic layout.
Question: Are there speech bubbles present in the image containing words related to articulation and clarity?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: A neutral background is specified to avoid distraction. This typically means solid light gray, beige, or off-white tones without patterns or strong colors.
Question: Is the background of the image a neutral color (e.g., light gray, beige, or off-white) without patterns or distracting elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: High-contrast text colors ensure readability. This means text should use combinations like black-on-white or white-on-dark, avoiding low-contrast pairs such as gray-on-beige.
Question: Does the text in the infographic use high-contrast color combinations (e.g., dark text on light background or vice versa)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q9:
Thinking process: Subtle branch elements must be included to add natural aesthetics without overpowering the design. These could be faint tree branches in the corners or behind the owl, rendered lightly.
Question: Are subtle branch elements visible in the image, integrated into the design without dominating the scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
