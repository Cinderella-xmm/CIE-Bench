Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the figure into a chibi-style figurine. Chibi style is characterized by large head-to-body ratio, simplified features, and exaggerated proportions. This must be visually distinguishable from the original realistic depiction.
Question: Is the seated figure rendered in a chibi style with an oversized head and simplified facial features?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The tricorne hat is explicitly mentioned as a key feature to emphasize. In a chibi style, this should remain recognizable but proportionally larger relative to the head.
Question: Is the tricorne hat clearly visible and proportionally large compared to the head, consistent with chibi design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The coat must be detailed and reflective of a pirate captain’s attire. In chibi style, details like buttons, epaulettes, and trim should still be present and stylized.
Question: Does the coat feature visible decorative elements such as gold buttons, trim, or epaulettes consistent with a pirate captain’s uniform?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The figure must be holding a miniature treasure chest with gold coins spilling out. This object must be clearly identifiable and positioned in the hands.
Question: Is the figure holding a small, closed treasure chest from which gold coins are visibly spilling out?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The gold coins must be exaggerated and sparkling to emphasize their value and fantasy element. Sparkle effects can include glints, highlights, or particle effects.
Question: Are the gold coins depicted with exaggerated size and visible sparkle effects, such as bright highlights or shimmering particles?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The base must be a stylized wooden pirate ship deck, indicating wood texture, planks, and possibly curvature to suggest a ship surface.
Question: Is the figurine placed on a wooden surface that resembles a pirate ship deck with visible planks and curved edges?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The deck must be adorned with tiny daggers and nautical motifs such as anchors, ropes, or compasses to support the maritime theme.
Question: Are tiny daggers and other nautical symbols (e.g., anchors, ropes, or compasses) visible on the ship deck around the figurine?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
