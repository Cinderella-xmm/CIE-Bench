This implies that the original teapot shape must no longer be recognizable, and instead, the object should clearly resemble an owl with mechanical features. The presence of wings, head, beak, tail, and eyes must be evident.",
      "question": "Is the overall shape of the object now clearly that of an owl rather than a teapot?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The lid of the teapot is specified to become the crown-like head of the owl. This means the top part of the original teapot must now serve as the head, likely elevated and shaped like a regal or ornamental crown, consistent with an owl's head structure.",
