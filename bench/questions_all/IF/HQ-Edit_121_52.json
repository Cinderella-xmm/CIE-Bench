      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the astronaut into a cartoon-style character. This implies simplification of features, exaggerated proportions, and non-realistic rendering such as bold outlines, flat colors, or expressive facial features typical of cartoons. The original image is photorealistic, so the edited version must clearly shift to a stylized, non-photorealistic cartoon aesthetic.",
      "question": "Is the astronaut rendered in a cartoon style with simplified features, bold lines, or exaggerated proportions?",

      "thinking_process": "\"Enlarge the astronaut's pose with action zig-zags\" refers to increasing the scale of the figure and adding dynamic motion lines (zig-zag patterns) around the limbs or body to suggest movement, common in comic book or cartoon art. These lines should be visibly present to indicate action.",
      "question": "Are there visible action zig-zag lines surrounding the astronaut’s limbs or body to indicate motion?",

      "thinking_process": "The suit must be stylized with celestial motifs—such as stars, planets, constellations, or cosmic patterns—in a color palette dominated by blues and silvers. This means the original realistic suit texture should be replaced or overlaid with decorative, thematic designs using these colors.",
      "question": "Does the astronaut’s suit feature decorative celestial motifs such as stars, planets, or galaxies in blue and silver tones?",

      "thinking_process": "The original lunar surface is realistic; the instruction specifies replacing it with an \"illustrated\" version. An illustrated surface would have hand-drawn or graphic qualities—such as simplified craters, clean outlines, or stylized shading—not photorealistic textures.",
      "question": "Is the moon surface beneath the astronaut depicted in an illustrated, non-photorealistic style with simplified or graphic elements?",

While this is a physical print requirement, the digital version should visually reflect the intended outcome: a border with space-related elements (e.g., stars, rockets, planets) and a simulated textured paper background.",
      "question": "Does the image include a space-themed border (e.g., stars, planets, rockets) and a visible textured white background resembling card stock?",
