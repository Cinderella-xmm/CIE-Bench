- Convert the kimono's floral pattern and delicate fabric into a vibrant anime-style illustration
- Elevate the cherry blossoms into oversized, colorful props with exaggerated petals
- Render the branch shapes as sharply defined ink lines
- Accentuate rich color contrasts throughout the image
- Maintain the overall composition and subject positioning (e.g., person in center, mask, hairstyle)
- Ensure the style transformation applies consistently across all relevant elements (kimono, flowers, branches)

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the kimono’s floral pattern and fabric into an anime-style illustration. This implies stylized outlines, bold colors, simplified shading, and possibly exaggerated patterns typical of anime art—such as thick black lines, flat or gradient fills, and dynamic color blocking. The fabric should no longer appear realistic but instead resemble illustrated material.
Question: Does the kimono feature stylized, bold outlines and vibrant, flat or gradient colors characteristic of anime illustration?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: "Oversized, colorful props" indicates that the cherry blossoms must be significantly larger than natural scale and rendered with saturated, non-realistic hues. They should dominate the visual space around the head and appear as decorative elements rather than natural flora.
Question: Are the cherry blossoms visibly enlarged beyond natural proportions and rendered in bright, unnatural colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: "Sharply defined ink lines" refers to the use of strong, clean, black or dark outlines resembling traditional ink brushwork, commonly seen in manga or sumi-e inspired styles. These lines should define the branches clearly and contrast strongly with the background and flower colors.
Question: Are the cherry blossom branches depicted with sharp, high-contrast ink-like lines, lacking soft gradients or natural textures?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: "Accentuate rich color contrasts" means there should be strong differences between adjacent colors—such as bright pinks against dark outlines, vivid reds on the kimono versus pale skin tones—and high saturation levels across the image.
Question: Are there strong, visually striking color contrasts throughout the image, especially between the kimono, flowers, and background?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The original image contains a specific composition: a woman wearing a mask, with hair styled in a traditional updo, adorned with flowers. The edit must preserve this core structure while applying stylistic changes. Therefore, the subject's position, facial features, and mask must remain intact even if the surrounding elements are transformed.
Question: Is the person’s face, mask, hairstyle, and general pose preserved in the same position and orientation as in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
