      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the entire scene must be enclosed within a decorative glass orb. This implies a spherical boundary around the image content, visible as a transparent dome-like structure with possible reflections or refractions on its surface. The presence of such a boundary is necessary to confirm encapsulation.",
      "question": "Is the entire forest lake scene enclosed within a visible spherical glass orb?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The ducks in the original image are realistically rendered birds. The instruction requires transforming them into 3D models with glossy finishes, which means they should appear stylized, smooth, and reflective, differing from their original appearance. The transformation must be clearly visible.",
      "question": "Have the ducks been replaced with 3D models that have a glossy, reflective surface finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for using layers of resin and transparent textures to simulate water depth and clarity. This would result in visual effects such as layered translucency, refractive distortions, or embedded textures resembling resin casting, especially noticeable in how light interacts with the water surface and submerged elements.",
      "question": "Does the water feature layered resin-like textures and transparent materials that enhance depth and clarity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly states adding miniature woodland animal figurines among rocks and greenery. These should be small-scale, detailed figures (e.g., squirrels, rabbits, frogs) placed in naturalistic positions within the scene, distinguishable from the main elements.",
      "question": "Are there visible miniature figurines of woodland animals placed among the rocks and vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The orb must be positioned on a natural wood base, implying a wooden platform or stand beneath the glass sphere. The base should appear organic in texture, possibly with grain patterns, knots, or bark details, contrasting with the smoothness of the orb.",
      "question": "Is the glass orb resting on a natural wood base with visible organic textures such as grain or bark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
