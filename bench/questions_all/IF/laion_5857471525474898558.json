    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the entire building facade into an oversized LEGO structure. This implies that the architectural elements such as walls, windows, and doors must be rendered in a blocky, modular style consistent with LEGO bricks, not realistic masonry or glass. The visual texture should resemble interlocking plastic bricks.",
      "question": "Is the building's facade composed of visible, blocky LEGO-like bricks forming the overall structure?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies using muted reds and muted blues to represent the original brick and window frame colors. This means the primary color palette should reflect these tones rather than bright or natural hues, while maintaining contrast between wall and trim elements.",
      "question": "Are the buildingâ€™s bricks rendered in muted red tones and the window frames in muted blue tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The climbing greenery on the building must be replaced with LEGO-style vines. These should appear as segmented, modular green pieces resembling plant stems or vines made from LEGO elements, not real foliage.",
      "question": "Have the climbing plants been replaced with green, segmented LEGO-style vines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Balconies must be clearly identifiable as LEGO structures, with gray railings that have the characteristic blocky, modular appearance of LEGO pieces. Realistic metal or ornamental railings should no longer be present.",
      "question": "Do all balconies feature gray, blocky LEGO-style railings instead of realistic metal or decorative designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The LEGO building must be placed on a simple platform to emphasize its toy-like, constructed nature. This platform should be flat, minimal, and visually distinct from the ground, likely made of LEGO blocks or a plain baseplate.",
      "question": "Is the LEGO building situated on a flat, simple platform that contrasts with the surrounding environment to highlight its blocky aesthetic?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
