Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the overall image should be rendered in a Japanese woodblock style. This style is characterized by distinct features such as flat areas of color, bold outlines, minimal shading, use of negative space, and stylized natural elements (like trees and water). These visual traits must be present to satisfy the style requirement.
Question: Does the image exhibit characteristics of Japanese woodblock art, including flat colors, strong outlines, and stylized natural elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The character must be portrayed as a wise elder wearing traditional attire, likely resembling a kimono or similar garment. His expression should reflect thoughtfulness or wisdom, possibly with a gentle smile or contemplative gaze. The interaction with the duck chess set must be visible, such as hands near the board or posture suggesting engagement.
Question: Is the elderly man depicted in traditional Japanese attire and shown interacting with the duck chess pieces in a thoughtful manner?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The environment must include intricate trees and a reflecting pond. Intricate trees imply detailed bark, layered branches, and foliage typical of woodblock prints. A reflecting pond means the surface should mirror surrounding elements like trees and sky, creating symmetry and depth.
Question: Are there intricately detailed trees and a pond that reflects the surrounding scenery in the background?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The color palette must consist primarily of deep greens, earthy browns, and subtle grays to reflect natural harmony. Bright or unnatural colors (such as vibrant yellows or pinks) would violate this requirement unless used sparingly within context (e.g., the ducks may be colorful but should not dominate).
Question: Are the dominant colors in the image deep greens, earthy browns, and subtle grays, consistent with a natural and harmonious palette?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The title "The Duck Chessmaster's Wisdom" must be present in elegant calligraphy, positioned in the lower right corner. Calligraphy implies hand-drawn script with flowing strokes, characteristic of East Asian writing styles. Its placement must be unambiguous and clearly legible.
Question: Is the title "The Duck Chessmaster's Wisdom" written in elegant calligraphy and located in the lower right corner of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
