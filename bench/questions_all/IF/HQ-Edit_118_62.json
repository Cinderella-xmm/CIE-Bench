      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the pigeon into a plush toy, which implies a change in material (from realistic feathers to soft fabric), shape (softened edges), and proportions (slightly exaggerated features such as larger eyes or beak). This requires assessing whether the bird now appears stylized and soft like a stuffed animal rather than a real bird.",
      "question": "Is the pigeon rendered as a plush toy with soft, rounded features and a fabric-like texture?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies using vibrant blue for the chest and gray for the wings. These are distinct color assignments that must be visually verifiable. The chest should appear bright blue, while the wings should be gray, not black or other colors.",
      "question": "Does the plush pigeon have a vibrant blue chest and gray wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires subtle feather patterns on the surface of the plush toy. This means the fabric should show faint, decorative lines or textures resembling feathers, not solid blocks of color.",
      "question": "Are there subtle feather-like patterns visible on the surface of the plush pigeon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The architectural structures must be transformed into cookie edifices with embossed details. This implies that buildings should resemble cookies—possibly with baked textures, sugar glaze effects, or raised designs—and not look like real stone or glass buildings.",
      "question": "Are the architectural structures in the background rendered as cookie-like forms with embossed or textured surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The plush pigeon must be placed on a simple wooden shelf, which is a new element not present in the original image. This shelf should be plain and made of wood, contrasting with the ornate cookie architecture.",
      "question": "Is the plush pigeon positioned on a simple wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes enhancing the playful contrast between soft textures (plush) and intricate cookie architecture. This requires both elements to be clearly distinguishable in texture—soft, fuzzy appearance of the plush versus rigid, detailed, baked-looking structures.",
      "question": "Is there a clear visual contrast between the soft, plush texture of the pigeon and the hard, embossed texture of the cookie architecture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
