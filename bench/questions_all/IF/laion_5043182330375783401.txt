Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire image into an Art Deco-inspired poster. This involves adopting characteristic visual elements such as symmetry, strong vertical/horizontal lines, geometric ornamentation, and a sense of glamour or modernity typical of the 1920s–1930s style. The term "poster" implies a flat, graphic quality with high contrast and stylized forms.
Question: Is the overall composition stylized with strong geometric lines, symmetry, and decorative elements typical of Art Deco design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The suit must be transformed into bold geometric shapes using metallic silver and blue hues. This means the original clothing should no longer resemble realistic fabric but instead be composed of sharp angles, clean edges, and a color palette dominated by reflective silver and deep blue tones.
Question: Are the suit’s contours replaced with bold, angular geometric shapes in metallic silver and blue colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The chair must be accentuated with streamlined patterns, which in Art Deco context refers to smooth, elongated forms, often with repeating motifs like chevrons, zigzags, or curved lines that suggest motion and elegance.
Question: Does the chair feature sleek, linear, or repeating decorative patterns consistent with Art Deco streamlining?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The background must be rendered in a vibrant sunset gradient, meaning it should transition through warm colors such as orange, red, pink, and purple from top to bottom or across the frame, evoking a dramatic sky at dusk.
Question: Is the background a gradient transitioning through warm sunset colors such as orange, red, and purple?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: While the style is being changed, the figure’s posture and identity must remain recognizable—especially the seated position, arms crossed, and facial features like the mustache and closed eyes. This ensures the transformation respects the original subject while applying new stylistic rules.
Question: Has the figure maintained its original seated pose with arms crossed and facial features (such as the mustache and closed eyes) clearly visible?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
