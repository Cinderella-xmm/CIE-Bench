      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the dragonfly into an ethereal water spirit. This implies a fundamental change in appearance—no longer a realistic insect but a mystical, fluid-like entity. Key indicators include non-solid form, glowing or semi-transparent features, and a connection to water elements.",
      "question": "Is the dragonfly visually transformed into a non-realistic, ethereal water spirit rather than a regular insect?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The wings must be translucent and shimmering, resembling cascading waterfalls. This involves visible translucency, motion-like flow patterns, and possibly light refraction effects similar to flowing water.",
      "question": "Do the wings appear translucent with shimmering, waterfall-like patterns that suggest flowing water?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The body should feature iridescent, scaly textures with swirling blue patterns. Iridescence means color shifts under light; scales imply layered surface texture; swirling blue patterns indicate dynamic, wave-like designs.",
      "question": "Does the dragonfly's body display iridescent, scale-like textures with visible swirling blue patterns?",

      "question": "Do the dragonfly’s eyes appear dark and deep, resembling the abyssal depths of the ocean with subtle inner glows or reflective qualities?",
