Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the final output should be a digital character card styled like an RPG collectible. This implies a structured layout with borders, text elements, and thematic design consistent with trading cards, not just a standalone portrait. The presence of a frame, stat bars, title, and nameplate are all indicators of this format.
Question: Is the image formatted as a digital character card with a defined border and layout typical of an RPG collectible?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states the character must be rendered in a heroic 3D illustration style. This refers to the visual depth, lighting, shading, and modeling quality that distinguish 3D renders from flat 2D art. Key features include realistic proportions, dynamic lighting, and volumetric details.
Question: Does the character appear in a three-dimensional, heroically stylized rendering with realistic lighting and depth?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The ornate blue-and-gold uniform is a core visual element mentioned twice—once in the description and again in the instruction to highlight it. The uniform must feature rich gold embroidery, epaulets, buttons, and a formal military-style design in blue and gold colors.
Question: Is the character wearing a detailed blue military-style uniform with prominent gold embellishments including epaulets, buttons, and trim?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The fiery staff is a central attribute tied to the 'Flame Commander' identity. It must be visibly present, emitting flames, and designed with ornate golden details. Its presence is essential to fulfill the character’s thematic role.
Question: Is the character holding a golden staff topped with a bright flame?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction requires stat bars with specific values: Leadership +10, Valor +9, Wisdom +8, Fire Mastery +10. These must be clearly visible as text elements on the card, formatted consistently (e.g., bracketed labels with numerical values).
Question: Are four stat bars displayed on the card showing exactly [Leadership +10], [Valor +9], [Wisdom +8], and [Fire Mastery +10]?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A title banner at the top with a crest emblem is required. This means there must be a decorative header at the top of the card containing both a textual title and a symbolic crest or insignia, likely associated with liberty or command.
Question: Is there a title banner at the top of the card that includes a crest emblem?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The nameplate at the bottom must read exactly 'Commander of Light'. This is a fixed text label that must be legible and positioned at the bottom of the card.
Question: Is there a nameplate at the bottom of the card with the exact text 'Commander of Light'?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: The backdrop must depict a majestic battlefield with soft mountain silhouettes. This implies a landscape background featuring distant mountains, possibly with smoke or haze, and a sense of open terrain suitable for battle.
Question: Does the background show a battlefield scene with soft, distant mountain silhouettes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q9:
Thinking process: The card must be framed with burnished bronze edges, indicating a metallic, polished border around the entire card, contributing to a regal and premium appearance.
Question: Is the entire character card surrounded by a burnished bronze-colored border?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
