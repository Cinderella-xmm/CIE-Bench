- Replace sausages, salad, and egg with tessellated glass tiles
- Use warm terracotta-colored tiles for sausage shapes
- Use leafy green-colored tiles for the salad
- Use sunny yellow-colored tiles for the egg
- Use larger tiles for sausage shapes
- Use smaller tiles for intricate lettuce details
- Use round tiles for the egg shape
- Arrange the tile composition symmetrically on a plain ceramic backdrop
- Maintain the overall plate layout but transform all food elements into mosaic art
- Ensure the artistic composition is vibrant and visually cohesive

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies replacing the sausages, salad, and egg with tessellated glass tiles. This requires that none of the original food items remain visible and are fully substituted by tile-based representations.
Question: Are the sausages, salad, and egg completely replaced by glass tiles?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The color requirement for the sausages is "warm terracotta," which implies earthy reddish-brown hues typical of terracotta. The tiles representing the sausages must reflect this specific color palette.
Question: Are the tiles used for the sausage shapes in warm terracotta tones?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The salad should be represented using leafy green tiles, indicating that the mosaic version must use green shades resembling lettuce and other greens, not just any green.
Question: Are the tiles forming the salad in leafy green colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The egg must be made from round tiles in sunny yellow to represent the yolk and white, matching the described "sunny yellows" and circular form.
Question: Is the egg-shaped area composed of round tiles in sunny yellow tones?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies using larger tiles for sausages and smaller ones for lettuce to reflect detail level. This requires a clear difference in tile size between the two elements.
Question: Are the tiles used for the sausages visibly larger than those used for the lettuce?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The arrangement must be symmetrical on a plain ceramic backdrop. This means the overall composition should show balance and symmetry, and the background should be a neutral ceramic surface without patterns or textures.
Question: Is the mosaic composition arranged symmetrically on a plain ceramic background?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The transformation must result in a vibrant, artistic composition using glass tiles. Vibrancy implies strong contrast and saturation in colors, and artistic composition suggests intentional design and visual harmony.
Question: Does the image display a vibrant and artistically cohesive mosaic design using glass tiles?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
