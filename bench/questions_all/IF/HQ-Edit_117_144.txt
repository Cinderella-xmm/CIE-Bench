Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the image to be transformed into a cartoon style. This implies simplified lines, exaggerated features, and a lack of photorealistic textures or shading. The elderly man’s facial features, clothing, and background should reflect this stylistic shift.
Question: Is the elderly man depicted in a cartoon style with simplified features and exaggerated proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The cane must be transformed into a golden scepter. A scepter typically has a regal, ornate design, often with a crown-like or symbolic top, and is made of gold or gold-colored material. The transformation should clearly distinguish it from a regular walking cane.
Question: Has the cane been replaced with a golden scepter featuring an ornate or regal design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The ensemble (coat, vest, trousers, tie, shoes) must be colored in pastel tones. Pastel colors are soft, muted shades such as light pink, lavender, pale blue, mint green, or beige—avoiding bright or saturated hues.
Question: Are all elements of the man’s clothing rendered in soft, muted pastel colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The man must be positioned on a stylized cobblestone path. This means the ground beneath him should resemble cobblestones but with artistic or exaggerated patterns, possibly curved or geometrically arranged, rather than realistic paving stones.
Question: Is the man standing on a stylized cobblestone path with artistic or non-realistic stone patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Detachable sections for personal notes imply that there are blank areas or borders around the main image designed to be removed or written on, such as tear-off tabs or margin spaces. These should be visually distinct and functional in layout.
Question: Are there visible detachable sections or margins around the print intended for personal notes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Stamped details for an interactive art piece suggest the inclusion of graphic stamps—such as postmark-style seals, icons, or symbols—placed around the image to simulate collectible or personalized elements. These should resemble real-world stamp designs.
Question: Are there visible stamped details (e.g., seal-like graphics, ink marks, or insignias) around the print?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
