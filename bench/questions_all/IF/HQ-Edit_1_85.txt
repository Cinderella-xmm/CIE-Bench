Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the image into a series of art postcards. This implies that the final output should consist of multiple postcard-sized images, each depicting the girl in the described style. The visual format must reflect this multiplicity and standard postcard dimensions.
Question: Is the edited image presented as a series of separate postcard-sized panels?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The paper-cut style is a specific artistic technique involving layered, flat shapes resembling cut-out paper. It often features clean edges, silhouettes, and visible layering effects. The presence of intricate lace detailing on the blouse must be rendered in this same paper-cut aesthetic—using fine, geometric patterns that mimic lace but are stylized as cut-paper elements.
Question: Does the girl’s blouse feature intricate lace details rendered in a paper-cut style with sharp, layered edges?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The violin must be visibly enlarged compared to its original size relative to the girl's body. This change should be noticeable in proportion—making the instrument more prominent in the composition and enhancing its visual importance.
Question: Has the violin been enlarged in size relative to the girl's body?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The girl’s pose must be refined to emphasize musical expression. This includes subtle changes such as a more dynamic hand position, head tilt, or facial focus suggesting engagement with the music. Her posture should convey elegance and emotional depth in playing.
Question: Does the girl’s pose show an enhanced sense of musical expression through refined hand placement, posture, or facial focus?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies printing on textured cream stock, which refers to the physical material of the postcards. While texture may not be directly visible in digital form, the image should visually suggest a matte, slightly rough surface consistent with cream-colored cardstock. Additionally, the overall tone and lighting should match this paper quality.
Question: Does the image have a visual appearance consistent with being printed on textured cream stock (e.g., warm off-white tone, soft matte finish)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The postcard backs must include blank music sheet motifs for notes. This means that when viewed from the reverse side of the postcards, there should be a pattern resembling staff lines and empty note spaces, designed to allow handwritten messages.
Question: Are the back sides of the postcards illustrated with blank music sheet motifs suitable for writing notes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
