      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly requires transforming the image into an infographic titled \"The Saga of the Heroic Bread Warrior.\" This means the title must be present and clearly visible in the edited image. The term \"infographic\" implies structured visual content beyond just a static image.",
      "question": "Is the title \"The Saga of the Heroic Bread Warrior\" displayed prominently in the image?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The sandwich must be anthropomorphized as a heroic knight, which involves adding features such as facial expressions, limbs, or knight-like attire. Specifically, the instruction mentions \"bread armor\" and a \"leafy lettuce cape,\" both of which are specific visual elements that must be added.",
      "question": "Does the sandwich have bread armor and a leafy lettuce cape as part of its design?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "A timeline at the bottom is required to narrate the bread knight’s quest. This means there should be a sequence of events visually represented along the lower portion of the image. The use of whimsical hand-drawn illustrations implies non-realistic, cartoonish art style.",
      "question": "Is there a timeline at the bottom of the image depicting the bread knight's quest using whimsical hand-drawn illustrations?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The narrative elements must use bold, comic-style text. This refers to font style—likely large, outlined, or stylized lettering typical of comic books. This is distinct from regular or elegant fonts.",
      "question": "Are the narrative texts in the image rendered in bold, comic-style font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies vibrant, contrasting colors for emphasis. This means the color palette should include bright, high-saturation hues with strong contrast between elements (e.g., reds against greens, yellows against blues) to draw attention.",
      "question": "Are vibrant and contrasting colors used throughout the image to emphasize key elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Dynamic, circular icons representing action scenes must be included. These would appear as round symbols showing key moments (e.g., battle, journey, triumph), likely placed alongside the timeline or within the narrative flow.",
      "question": "Are there circular icons depicting action scenes placed dynamically within the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The layout must be landscape-oriented, meaning the image is wider than it is tall, allowing space for a horizontal timeline and multiple visual sections.",
      "question": "Is the overall layout of the image in landscape orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The image must have clear, engaging visual sections for storytelling. This implies segmentation into areas such as title, character, timeline, and icons, each separated by spacing or design elements to guide the viewer’s eye.",
      "question": "Are there clearly defined visual sections in the image dedicated to different parts of the story (e.g., title, character, timeline)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
