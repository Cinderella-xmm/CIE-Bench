      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the sandcastle into translucent crystal sculptures. This implies that the material must change from sand to crystal, with visible facets and transparency. The structure should retain its architectural form but be made of clear, crystalline material.",
      "question": "Is the sandcastle rendered as a translucent crystal sculpture with visible facets?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies highlights in soft blue shades on the crystal castle. This means the lighting effect on the crystal surfaces should include subtle blue reflections or glows, indicating illumination or internal light interaction.",
      "question": "Are there soft blue highlights visible on the surface of the crystal castle?",

      "thinking_process": "The seashells in the original image must be replaced with small, polished gemstones in pastel hues. This means no natural shells should remain; instead, each shell-like object should be a smooth, shiny gemstone in colors such as pink, lavender, mint, or peach.",
      "question": "Have all seashells been replaced with small, polished gemstones in pastel hues?",

      "thinking_process": "The ocean must be reimagined as a wave pattern etched into a frosted glass slab. This implies the water is no longer liquid but a static, textured surface resembling frosted glass with engraved wave lines, lacking motion or reflection of real water.",
      "question": "Is the ocean depicted as a wave pattern etched into a frosted glass slab rather than flowing water?",

      "thinking_process": "The entire scene must be placed within a minimalist gallery display case. This suggests the presence of clean, transparent boundaries (like glass), neutral background, and controlled lighting typical of an art exhibit. The setting should not resemble a beach or outdoor environment.",
      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a minimalist gallery display case with clean edges and neutral surroundings?",
