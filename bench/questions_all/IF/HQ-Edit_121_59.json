      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires creating four decorative prints, which implies multiple copies of the same image with specific stylistic changes. This is an explicit requirement about quantity and format. The term \"decorative prints\" suggests that the output should be framed and intended for display.",
      "question": "Are there exactly four separate images or prints shown, each featuring the fisherman?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "\"Semi-cartoon style\" refers to a stylized, exaggerated yet recognizable artistic approach—common features include simplified forms, bold outlines, expressive features, and reduced realism. This must be visible in the character’s rendering.",
      "question": "Does the fisherman exhibit exaggerated proportions, simplified facial features, and bold outlines characteristic of semi-cartoon art style?",

      "thinking_process": "\"Enlarge the rustic texture of his hat and plaid shirt\" means the visual detail such as fabric weave, stitching, or weathering should be visibly enhanced and more prominent than in the original. This involves increased textural contrast and definition.",
      "question": "Is the texture of the fisherman's hat and plaid shirt visibly more detailed and pronounced compared to the original image?",

      "thinking_process": "\"Transform the fishing pole into a golden wand\" requires a clear change in object identity—replacing the fishing rod with a magical-looking golden staff. The material should appear metallic and golden, and its shape should resemble a wand rather than a fishing rod.",
      "question": "Has the fishing rod been replaced with a golden-colored wand-like object that resembles a magical staff?",

      "thinking_process": "\"Magical ripples on the water\" implies non-natural, stylized wave patterns—possibly glowing, swirling, or emitting light—suggesting supernatural or fantasy elements. These should differ from realistic water reflections.",
      "question": "Are there glowing, swirling, or ornamental ripples on the surface of the water that suggest magical effects?",

      "thinking_process": "\"Frame in distressed wood with embossed pine tree details\" specifies both material (wood) and design (distressed finish and pine tree embossing). Each print must be enclosed in such a frame, which must be visually identifiable.",
      "question": "Is each of the four prints enclosed in a wooden frame that shows signs of distress (such as scratches or weathering) and has raised pine tree patterns embossed on it?",
