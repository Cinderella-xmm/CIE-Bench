Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the entire clock must be transformed from wood into translucent crystal craftsmanship. This includes not only the frame but also all decorative elements, requiring a material change from opaque wood to transparent or semi-transparent crystal. The key observable feature is whether the original wooden texture has been replaced with a glass-like, translucent appearance.
Question: Is the clock's frame made of translucent crystal instead of wood?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states that frosted crystal should be used for the frame and intricate detailing. Frosted crystal implies a matte, slightly opaque surface with visible light diffusion, differing from clear or polished glass. This must be visually distinguishable from the original polished wood carvings.
Question: Are the ornamental details and frame of the clock crafted from frosted crystal rather than carved wood?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The clock face must be replaced with smooth, clear crystal containing etched Roman numerals. This means the original aged wooden face with black Roman numerals should no longer exist; instead, the numerals should appear as faintly engraved or etched lines on a transparent surface.
Question: Is the clock face made of smooth, clear crystal with etched Roman numerals instead of a wooden face with painted numerals?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The pendulum must be reshaped into a faceted crystal ornament. This implies geometric cuts and reflective surfaces resembling gemstone facets, replacing the original wooden circular pendulum. The shape and material must clearly differ from the original.
Question: Has the pendulum been replaced with a faceted crystal ornament instead of a solid wooden disc?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The background must be changed to a minimalist white marble wall. This requires the removal of the original dark textured wall and replacement with a clean, uniform white surface exhibiting subtle veining typical of marble, emphasizing the elegance of the crystal clock.
Question: Is the clock mounted on a minimalist white marble wall with visible natural veining?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
