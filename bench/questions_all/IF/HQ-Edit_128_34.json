      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires the entire scene to be enclosed in a crystal-clear resin cube. This implies a transparent, three-dimensional boundary around the cityscape and car, visible as a glass-like container that distorts light slightly at edges but does not obscure details. The presence of such a cube must be directly observable.",
      "question": "Is the cityscape and car fully enclosed within a transparent, cube-shaped resin casing?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The vehicles must be stylized with a sleek, futuristic design featuring metallic and reflective textures. This means the car should exhibit high-gloss surfaces, sharp lines, glowing or chrome elements, and visual cues suggesting advanced materials like carbon fiber or polished alloy.",
      "question": "Does the car feature a sleek, futuristic design with metallic and highly reflective surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Skyscrapers must be shrunk to emphasize depth and scale, meaning they appear smaller and more densely packed than in the original, creating a diorama-like perspective. This change should affect perceived size relative to the car and street.",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers visibly reduced in size compared to the original image, enhancing the sense of depth and scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Micro LED lights must be added to the skyscrapers to simulate illuminated windows. These should appear as small, evenly spaced points of light across building facades, resembling tiny glowing dots rather than solid lit areas.",
      "question": "Do the skyscrapers have small, distinct points of light resembling micro LEDs on their windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Delicate micro foliage must be added to the trees, maintaining rich green tones. This implies the trees are composed of fine, detailed leaves or branches, possibly scaled down, but still vibrant and contrasting against the urban gray and metal tones.",
      "question": "Do the trees feature finely detailed, miniature foliage with rich green coloration that contrasts with the surrounding urban structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The resin cube must be crystal clear, meaning it allows full visibility of the scene inside without tinting or obstruction. It should also show subtle refraction effects at the edges, indicating a solid transparent material.",
      "question": "Is the resin cube completely transparent with no visible color distortion or opacity, allowing full view of the interior scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The original spatial relationship between the car and the buildings must be preserved, even after scaling and stylization. The car should remain centered in the street, facing forward, with consistent alignment relative to the road markings and buildings.",
      "question": "Is the car positioned in the same relative location on the street as in the original image, maintaining its orientation and alignment with the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
