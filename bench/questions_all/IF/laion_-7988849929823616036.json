      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly requires transforming the formal attire into a vibrant, floral-patterned suit. This means the original dark suit must be replaced with one that includes visible floral patterns and bright colors. The transformation should cover the jacket and possibly vest, maintaining the same silhouette but altering the pattern and color scheme.",
      "question": "Has the formal suit been replaced with a vibrant, floral-patterned design?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The monochrome bow tie in the original image must be replaced with a bold graphic design incorporating vivid colors and geometric shapes. This implies a departure from the grayscale checkered pattern to a more dynamic, colorful, and abstract design consistent with pop art aesthetics.",
      "question": "Has the bow tie been replaced with a bold, colorful design featuring geometric shapes?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The background must take on a dotted texture for contrast, which is a hallmark of pop art style (e.g., Ben-Day dots). This change should be visible across the entire background area, not just partially or subtly.",
      "question": "Does the background feature a distinct dotted texture?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies a pop art-inspired makeover. This involves not only color and pattern changes but also stylistic elements such as high contrast, bold outlines, flat color areas, and possible exaggeration of features—consistent with artists like Roy Lichtenstein. The overall look should reflect this artistic movement.",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit characteristics of pop art style, such as bold outlines, flat colors, and high contrast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "While the clothing and background are being modified, the subject’s facial features, expression, and posture should remain unchanged to preserve identity and context. The edit should not distort the face or alter the pose.",
      "question": "Have the subject’s facial features, expression, and posture remained unchanged?",
