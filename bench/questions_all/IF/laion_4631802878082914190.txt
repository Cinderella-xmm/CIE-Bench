Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies converting the original diagram into a whimsical comic illustration. This requires transforming the formal layout into a cartoonish, storybook-style scene with characters and narrative elements. The presence of anthropomorphic animals and comic elements like speech bubbles and expressive features indicates a shift from a technical diagram to a playful narrative format.
Question: Is the image now a whimsical comic illustration rather than a formal diagram?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly assigns specific animal characters to each phase of the CRISP-DM cycle. Each character must be present and correctly associated with its corresponding process step (e.g., owl for Business Understanding). This ensures accurate representation of roles.
Question: Is there a wise owl wearing glasses positioned in the Business Understanding section?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction requires replacing the original arrows with playful paths such as stepping stones or bridges to represent data flow. This transformation must maintain the cyclical nature of the process but in a more imaginative form.
Question: Are the connections between processes represented by playful paths like stepping stones or bridges instead of arrows?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The central data element must be transformed from a database icon into a visually engaging, fantastical object—specifically, a glowing loot of data crystals. This symbolizes data in a magical, storybook context and must be centrally located and shared among characters.
Question: Is the central "Data" element replaced with a glowing pile of data crystals, surrounded and guarded by all characters?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction mandates a title banner at the top with the exact phrase “The Adventures of Data Journey!”. This textual element is crucial for branding and thematic clarity and must be clearly visible.
Question: Is there a banner at the top of the image with the text “The Adventures of Data Journey!”?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Humor through speech bubbles is required to clarify each character’s role in an entertaining way. For example, the squirrel should have a line like “I dig data acorns!” which reflects both its action and the metaphorical meaning of data preparation.
Question: Does each character have a speech bubble with a humorous line describing their role in the data journey?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies a storybook-like aesthetic with bright colors. This implies vibrant, saturated hues, soft outlines, and possibly hand-drawn textures typical of children's books or animated comics.
Question: Does the image use bright colors and a storybook-like visual style?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: The aspect ratio must remain 3:4 to ensure proper display and consistency with the original format. This can be verified by comparing the width-to-height ratio of the image.
Question: Does the image maintain a 3:4 aspect ratio?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
