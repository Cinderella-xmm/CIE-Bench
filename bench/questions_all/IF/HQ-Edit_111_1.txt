Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the athlete into a dynamic art print series, which implies stylization beyond realism—specifically through exaggerated proportions and visual drama typical of comic art. This includes visible enhancement of musculature for dramatic effect.
Question: Are the athlete's muscles visibly exaggerated in a comic-book style, with enhanced definition and volume?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The gloves must be rendered in "fiery red with gold accents," indicating a specific color scheme and decorative detail. Fiery red suggests a bright, intense red tone, and gold accents imply metallic trim or detailing on the gloves.
Question: Are the boxing gloves predominantly fiery red with visible gold accents such as trim or highlights?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The background must feature an electrifying atmosphere with vibrant strobe lights, implying high-contrast lighting effects, pulsating brightness, and possibly motion blur or light streaks to convey energy.
Question: Is the background composed of dynamic, vibrant strobe lights creating an electrifying effect with bright flashes and contrast?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A blank motivational quote panel must be incorporated on the side, meaning there should be a clearly defined rectangular area with no text, positioned along one edge of the image, designed to hold a quote.
Question: Is there a blank rectangular panel positioned on the side of the image, intended for a motivational quote?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The final presentation must be a trio of gym wall prints, suggesting that the image is displayed as three separate but related panels arranged together, likely with consistent framing and design language.
Question: Is the image presented as three distinct but unified prints arranged side by side, suitable for display as gym wall art?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Bold typography is required to amplify the sportif energy, meaning large, impactful lettering should be present—possibly in the quote panel or elsewhere—to enhance the dynamic feel.
Question: Does the image include bold, large-scale typography that contributes to the energetic and sporty aesthetic?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
