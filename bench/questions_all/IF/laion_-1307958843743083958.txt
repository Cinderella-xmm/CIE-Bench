Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the cheetah figures into gold-finished perfume bottles. This requires changing the material appearance from ceramic/realistic animal to metallic gold, while preserving the exact seated pose and structural form of the cheetahs. The transformation must not alter posture or orientation.
Question: Are the cheetah figures replaced with gold-finished perfume bottles that maintain their original seated poses?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The botanical center is to be replaced with a translucent, green-tinted glass façade that cascades downward. This implies a vertical, flowing, transparent structure with a green hue, replacing the current leaf-patterned books. The material must appear glass-like and have a descending motion in its design.
Question: Has the botanical center been replaced with a translucent, green-tinted glass façade that has a cascading downward appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for minimalist branding on the bases using a chic serif font titled "Savanna Essence." This means visible text must appear on the base of each object, specifically the name "Savanna Essence," rendered in a refined serif typeface without excessive ornamentation.
Question: Is the text "Savanna Essence" present on the bases of both objects in a chic serif font?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The overall aesthetic must evoke elegance and luxury appropriate for a retail setting. Observable features include high-gloss finishes, clean lines, refined materials (gold, glass), and absence of clutter. The lighting should enhance premium qualities, such as reflections and smooth surfaces.
Question: Does the edited image convey an elegant and luxurious aesthetic consistent with a high-end retail perfume display?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The original composition includes two symmetrical bookends flanking a central vertical element. The instruction requires maintaining this layout even after transformation. Thus, the two gold bottles must remain symmetrically positioned on either side of the central glass façade.
Question: Are the two gold-finished perfume bottles symmetrically positioned on either side of the central glass façade, preserving the original spatial arrangement?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The presence of a reflective surface beneath the objects suggests a polished retail environment. The reflection should mirror the objects clearly, indicating a glossy floor or display platform typical of luxury stores.
Question: Is there a reflective surface beneath the objects showing clear reflections of the perfume bottles and central façade?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
