Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the sparrow into an "ethereal blossom spirit," which implies a complete transformation of its physical form to reflect floral and magical qualities. This includes replacing natural bird features with botanical elements, such as petals and vines, and adding luminous or magical effects like glowing eyes and dewdrops. The core requirement here is whether the birdâ€™s overall appearance has been fundamentally reimagined as a flower-based entity.
Question: Has the sparrow been transformed into an ethereal blossom spirit with a non-realistic, floral appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states that the feathers should be replaced with petal-like structures in a soft pink gradient. This requires visual verification of both texture (petal-like) and color (soft pink gradient), ensuring the entire body coverage matches this description.
Question: Are the bird's feathers replaced with petal-like structures that have a soft pink gradient?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Blossom patterns along the wings are a specific detail mentioned in the instructions. These must be visible as floral motifs integrated into the wing design, not just general pink coloring.
Question: Are there distinct blossom patterns visible along the wings of the bird?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The eyes are specified to be glowing emerald-green. This requires checking for both color accuracy (emerald green) and a glowing effect (such as luminosity or light emission).
Question: Do the bird's eyes appear as glowing emerald-green?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The tail must be replaced entirely with cascading cherry blossoms, meaning no original tail feathers should remain. The new tail should resemble a flowing arrangement of blossoms.
Question: Has the tail been replaced with cascading cherry blossoms?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Delicate vines must be embedded around the legs, indicating visible plant-like tendrils wrapped around the lower limbs. This is a specific structural addition.
Question: Are there delicate vines visibly wrapped around the bird's legs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: Sparkling dewdrop ornaments must be present on the chest, implying small, reflective droplet-like elements with a shimmering or glittering quality.
Question: Are there sparkling dewdrop ornaments visible on the bird's chest?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
