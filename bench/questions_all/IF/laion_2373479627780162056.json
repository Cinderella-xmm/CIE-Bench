      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies converting the scene into a vintage art print series on satin paper. This implies a transformation in medium and surface textureâ€”specifically, the image should appear as if printed on satin paper with a soft sheen and subtle reflective qualities typical of such material. Vintage art prints also suggest aged tones, possibly sepia or muted color palettes, and a slightly textured or grainy surface.",
      "question": "Does the edited image display a visual texture consistent with satin paper, including a soft sheen and slight reflectivity?",

      "thinking_process": "The suit must be stylized using watercolor blue-black tones. Watercolor implies translucent, blended edges, visible brushstrokes, and soft transitions between colors, especially in the dark blue to black range. This is distinct from solid digital rendering.",

Since this is a series, at least two different tie patterns should be present across the set.",

The image should convey depth, texture, and craftsmanship associated with leather binding.",

This means the image should include rich textures (e.g., satin, leather, brushed metal), balanced composition, refined color choices, and a sense of timeless design. Classic elegance also implies symmetry, restraint, and high-quality materials.",
