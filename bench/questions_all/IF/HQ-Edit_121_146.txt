Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the teapot into a candle holder packaging. This implies structural changes such as replacing the spout and interior with a glass chamber suitable for holding a candle, while maintaining the overall form. The key observable feature is whether the internal space now contains a transparent glass section designed to hold a candle.
Question: Is the central body of the object now a transparent glass chamber suitable for holding a candle?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The floral motifs must be preserved but transformed into embossed gold details surrounding the glass chamber. This means the original silver or metallic patterns should now appear in gold tone and raised texture, positioned around the glass portion.
Question: Are the floral motifs now rendered in embossed gold detail around the glass chamber?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The glass chamber must have a rich camel red hue, which refers to a deep, warm reddish-brown color typical of camel tones. This color should be visible through the transparent glass material.
Question: Does the glass chamber exhibit a rich camel red hue?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A polished wooden lid must be added, and it must mimic the contour of the original teapot's handle. This implies the lid has a wood-like appearance, smooth finish, and shape resembling the curved handle design.
Question: Is there a polished wooden lid present that mimics the contour of the original teapotâ€™s handle?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: An elegant brand logo must be incorporated on the base. This requires a visible, stylized text or emblem placed at the bottom of the object, distinct from other decorative elements.
Question: Is there a visible brand logo located on the base of the object?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The background must be replaced with a luxuriously patterned fabric. This means the original dark textured backdrop should be replaced with a textile surface showing intricate designs, possibly in silk or velvet texture with repeating patterns.
Question: Has the background been replaced with a luxuriously patterned fabric?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
