Q1:
Thinking process: Enhancing contrast involves making the differences between light and dark areas more pronounced, enhancing image clarity.
Question: Has the contrast in the image been enhanced?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Local sharpness refers to the clarity and definition of specific parts within the image.
Question: Is there visible improvement in the sharpness of zebras and the grassy ground in the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Metallic textures and platform details pertain to highlighting specific materials and structural elements, but since this image consists of zebras in a natural setting, these elements may not apply directly. However, we can interpret this requirement as emphasizing realistic and detailed depiction of natural textures.
Question: Are the natural textures of the zebras' stripes and the grassland detailed and clear?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: "City life" photojournalism aesthetic implies capturing urban dynamics, human activities, or structural elements which do not naturally exist in this image. We can interpret this by checking if elements that align with this aesthetic, such as buildings, vehicles, or people, have been added to simulate the theme.
Question: Have any urban elements, like buildings, vehicles, or people, been added to simulate a city life photojournalism aesthetic?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No

Q5:
Thinking process: Keeping the original composition means that the arrangement of elements in the frame has not been altered or shifted.
Question: Has the original composition of the zebras in the grassland been preserved?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
