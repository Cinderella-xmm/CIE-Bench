      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the original image of a sandpiper into a packaging design. This implies that the bird illustration must now be part of a larger product box structure rather than existing in isolation. The presence of a box-like form with defined edges and depth is necessary to fulfill this transformation.",
      "question": "Is the sandpiper illustration now part of a box-shaped packaging design?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the sandpiper should be stylized and featured on the box front. This means the bird must be rendered in a simplified or artistic style suitable for product packaging, not just a realistic depiction, and positioned prominently on the front surface of the box.",
      "question": "Is the sandpiper illustrated in a stylized manner and placed on the front of the packaging?",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "question": "Are nature-inspired textures visible on the surface of the packaging?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for text elements using eco-themed fonts. Eco-themed fonts typically have organic, hand-drawn, or minimalist characteristics resembling handwriting, foliage, or natural forms. The label \"Shoreline Explorer Set\" must appear in such a font.",
      "question": "Does the text \"Shoreline Explorer Set\" appear on the packaging in an eco-themed font?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "A flat bottom with wave patterns is specified. This means the base of the box must be visibly flat and decorated with horizontal or undulating lines resembling ocean waves, reinforcing the shoreline theme.",
      "question": "Does the bottom of the packaging feature a flat surface with wave-like patterns?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "A cut-out window shaped like binoculars must be present. This requires a distinct shape resembling binoculars (two connected ovals) that is transparent or hollowed out, allowing visibility into the interior of the box.",
      "question": "Is there a cut-out window on the packaging shaped like binoculars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The binocular-shaped cut-out must reveal part of the kit inside. This means the interior contents—such as tools, guides, or accessories—are partially visible through the window, indicating functionality and transparency in the packaging design.",
      "question": "Does the binocular-shaped cut-out reveal internal components of the birdwatching kit?",
