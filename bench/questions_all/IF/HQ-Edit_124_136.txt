Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the musician into a Byzantine monk. This involves changing attire, hairstyle, facial features (e.g., beard style), and overall appearance to align with historical Byzantine monastic iconography—typically including a long white beard, simple yet symbolic robes, and a tonsure or hooded head covering.
Question: Is the figure now depicted as a Byzantine monk with appropriate monastic attire and appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Aramaic scripts must be visibly woven into the robe. This implies text in an ancient Semitic script (Aramaic) integrated into the fabric pattern, not just decorative motifs. The script should be legible enough to identify as non-Latin and stylistically consistent with historical Aramaic inscriptions.
Question: Are Aramaic scripts visibly woven into the design of the musician’s robe?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The original instrument is a lute-like string instrument. The instruction specifies replacing it with a lyre featuring scribed bronze details. A lyre has a distinct Y-shaped frame, typically made of wood or metal, and "scribed bronze details" imply engraved or incised patterns resembling ancient inscriptions or ornamentation.
Question: Has the instrument been replaced with a lyre that includes visible scribed bronze details?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The background was originally a field of colorful flowers. The instruction calls for transforming it into an idyllic garden with olive trees. Olive trees are specific to Mediterranean landscapes and should be clearly identifiable by their silvery-green leaves and gnarled trunks.
Question: Are olive trees present in the background, forming part of an idyllic garden setting?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The Byzantine mosaic art style is defined by jewel-toned colors (deep blues, reds, golds), tessellated patterns (small geometric tiles), and a stylized, often religious aesthetic. These elements must be evident in the overall composition—especially in textures, clothing, and background.
Question: Does the image exhibit Byzantine mosaic art style features such as jewel-toned colors and tessellated patterns across the scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The figure must be seated on a carved stone bench, not directly on the ground. The bench should show signs of stonework, carving, and permanence, fitting a devotional or sacred context.
Question: Is the musician seated on a carved stone bench rather than directly on the ground?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies "tranquil devotion," which should be reflected in posture, facial expression, and gaze—likely serene, downward-looking, hands gently positioned, possibly in prayer or contemplative gesture.
Question: Does the musician’s posture and facial expression convey tranquil devotion?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: Small marble sculptures of cherubim and sacred symbols must surround the figure. These should be clearly distinguishable as sculptural objects made of marble (white or light gray, smooth texture), depicting cherubic figures or Christian symbols like crosses, doves, or alpha-omega.
Question: Are there small marble sculptures of cherubim and sacred symbols placed around the musician?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
