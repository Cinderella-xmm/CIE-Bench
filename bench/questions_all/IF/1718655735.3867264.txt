Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the fairy should be transformed into a miniature figure inside a delicate glass dome. This implies the presence of a transparent spherical or domed structure enclosing the fairy, with visible reflections or refractions typical of glass, and the fairy appearing smaller in scale relative to the environment.
Question: Is the fairy enclosed within a transparent glass dome?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The fairy must stand on a polished wooden base. This requires identifying a flat, reflective surface made of wood beneath the fairy, showing grain patterns and a smooth, glossy finish consistent with polished wood.
Question: Is the fairy standing on a polished wooden base?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction requires shimmering, metallic butterfly wings. These should have a reflective, iridescent surface with visible metallic sheen, possibly with highlights suggesting light interaction, and clearly resemble butterfly wing structure.
Question: Do the fairy's wings have a shimmering, metallic appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The outfit must feature intricate fabric textures. This means detailed patterns such as lace, embroidery, or layered textile designs are visibly present on the clothing, not just plain or smooth surfaces.
Question: Does the fairyâ€™s outfit display intricate fabric textures?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Translucent floating petals and small swirling leaves must surround the fairy. These elements should appear semi-transparent, gently suspended in mid-air, and positioned around the figure in motion-like arrangement to suggest movement and ethereality.
Question: Are there translucent floating petals and small swirling leaves surrounding the fairy?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The background must be a soft blue gradient to enhance the ethereal and magical atmosphere. This involves a smooth transition from one shade of blue to another, without abrupt changes or contrasting colors, contributing to a dreamlike ambiance.
Question: Is the background a soft blue gradient?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The overall scene must convey a whimsical and magical display. This is evaluated through the combination of the glass dome, floating elements, glowing or reflective materials, and harmonious composition that evokes fantasy and enchantment.
Question: Does the overall scene convey a whimsical and magical atmosphere?
Choices: Yes, No
