Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the woman into a ceramic doll figurine. This implies a change in medium from realistic human portrayal to stylized, inanimate figurine form with visible ceramic qualities such as smooth surface, slight sheen, and defined edges typical of porcelain dolls. The transformation must preserve her identity but alter her physical nature.
Question: Is the figure now depicted as a ceramic doll rather than a living person?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The gown must be rendered in soft pastel blue porcelain with silver details. This involves changing the fabric-like texture to a smooth, glazed porcelain surface with color and metallic highlights consistent with ceramic craftsmanship. The folds should appear crisp yet soft due to the material’s reflective properties.
Question: Is the gown made of soft pastel blue porcelain with visible silver detailing?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The floral embellishments must be replicated. These are decorative elements on the original dress that should now be present on the porcelain gown, possibly as raised or painted patterns in silver or complementary tones, maintaining their placement and style.
Question: Are the floral embellishments present on the gown in a manner consistent with porcelain decoration?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The figurine must lean against a miniature ornate column. This means a scaled-down version of the original architectural column must be present, with decorative carvings and proportions appropriate for a doll-sized scene.
Question: Is the figurine leaning against a miniature ornate column?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A matching glossy mantle surface is required, implying the surface behind or beside the column should reflect light and match the aesthetic of the porcelain, likely with a polished finish and classical design elements.
Question: Is there a glossy mantle surface adjacent to the column that matches the style and finish of the figurine?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The base must be intricately painted to mimic a vintage parlor setting, including furniture, decor, and ambiance typical of the Victorian era. This includes small-scale details like wallpaper, rugs, or furnishings.
Question: Is the base of the figurine intricately painted to depict a vintage parlor scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: Polished gold accents must be included in the base design, suggesting metallic highlights on trim, frames, or decorative elements within the parlor scene, adding opulence consistent with Victorian aesthetics.
Question: Are there polished gold accents visible on the base or within the parlor scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: The original posture—leaning with one arm resting on the column—must be preserved in the transformation. This ensures continuity of pose despite the material change.
Question: Does the figurine maintain the same leaning posture with one arm resting on the column as in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q9:
Thinking process: The material appearance must reflect porcelain, meaning smooth, slightly reflective surface with subtle glaze effects, avoiding any textile-like textures.
Question: Does the figurine exhibit a porcelain-like texture and gloss throughout its surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q10:
Thinking process: The facial features and expression of the original woman must be preserved in the doll form, ensuring likeness despite the stylization.
Question: Does the figurine retain the facial features and expression of the original woman?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
