      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the grassy field into a floating island. This implies that the field should appear suspended in space without any visible ground connection, and likely have a clear separation from the surrounding environment to suggest levitation. The edges of the island should be clearly defined and not grounded.",
      "question": "Is the green field depicted as a floating island disconnected from any ground or horizon?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies accentuating vibrant flower colors. This means the flowers (yellow daisies and red poppies) must appear more saturated, intense, or luminous than in the original image, possibly with enhanced contrast or glowing effects typical of surreal art.",
      "question": "Are the yellow and red flowers significantly more vibrant and saturated in color compared to the original?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The moon must be replaced with an oversized apple. This involves removing the moon entirely and placing a large, realistic or stylized apple in its position, proportionally much larger than natural objects in the scene, consistent with Magritte’s surrealist style.",
      "question": "Has the moon been replaced with an oversized apple in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Insects (bee and butterfly) must be transformed into playful, stylized motifs. This suggests they are no longer realistic but instead abstracted, cartoonish, or decorative—possibly with exaggerated features, bright outlines, or whimsical patterns—consistent with surrealism and Magritte’s symbolic approach.",
      "question": "Have the bee and butterfly been replaced with stylized, playful, non-realistic motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The tree must be reinterpreted as a hollow geometric structure. This implies it is no longer a natural tree but a constructed shape such as a cube, pyramid, or sphere with visible internal voids or transparent sections, maintaining its position but altering form completely.",
      "question": "Has the tree been replaced with a hollow geometric structure (e.g., cube, pyramid, or sphere) with visible interior or transparent parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The vast starlit backdrop must be maintained. This means the night sky with stars and cosmic elements should remain intact and prominent, even after other changes. It serves as the background context for the surreal scene.",
      "question": "Is the starry night sky with visible stars and cosmic depth still present and dominant in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
