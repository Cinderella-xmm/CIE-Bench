      "question": "Does the attire feature opulent fabric with gold filigree embroidery typical of Baroque fashion?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The original headpiece includes a turban with peacock feathers and flowers. The instruction specifies it should become an elaborate feathered crown adorned with jewels. A \"feathered crown\" suggests a structured, elevated headpiece resembling a crown rather than a wrapped turban, with feathers arranged in a regal or symmetrical pattern and embedded with gemstones.",
      "question": "Has the headpiece been transformed into an elaborate feathered crown adorned with jewels, replacing the original turban?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The background must be changed to a richly textured tapestry backdrop reflecting regal heritage. This implies a change from the current plain brown gradient background to one that resembles woven textile with patterns, possibly including heraldic symbols, floral motifs, or historical designs associated with royalty and nobility.",
      "question": "Is the background now a richly textured tapestry with patterns reflective of regal heritage, replacing the original plain backdrop?",
