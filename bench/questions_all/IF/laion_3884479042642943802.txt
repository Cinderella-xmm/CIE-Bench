Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the character's pose should be modified to crouching on a rooftop ledge. This requires a change from the original stance (which is a low crouch but not on a ledge) to one where she is positioned at the edge of a structure, with visual cues such as a drop-off or skyline below. The posture must reflect balance and readiness typical of a vigilante overlooking a city.
Question: Is the character crouching on a rooftop ledge with a visible drop-off or edge beneath her?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The background must feature a dimly lit cityscape with spotlights and distant skyscrapers. This implies an urban environment at night, with artificial lighting sources like streetlamps or building lights, and tall structures in the distance. The presence of these elements is necessary to establish the setting as a metropolitan area under cover of darkness.
Question: Does the background include a dimly lit cityscape with visible spotlights and distant skyscrapers?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The color palette must use deep shades of blue and black to create a moody, nocturnal atmosphere. These colors should dominate the sky, buildings, and shadows, contributing to a sense of mystery and tension appropriate for a vigilante narrative.
Question: Are the dominant colors in the image deep shades of blue and black, creating a dark, moody atmosphere?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The characterâ€™s claws must have a metallic glint, meaning they should reflect light with a shiny, silver or steel-like appearance, possibly with highlights suggesting illumination from ambient sources like spotlights. This detail enhances the visual impact of her weaponized hands.
Question: Do the character's claws exhibit a metallic glint with visible highlights indicating reflective material?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A speech bubble containing the exact phrase "The night awaits..." must be present. This textual element is essential to convey the narrative tone and align with the comic art panel format. The text should be legible and stylistically consistent with comic book dialogue.
Question: Is there a speech bubble with the text "The night awaits..." clearly visible in the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The overall composition must reflect a comic art panel narrative, implying clear framing, dynamic positioning, and storytelling cues such as perspective, lighting contrast, and visual focus on the character as a lone figure. The scene should feel like a still from a comic book page rather than a standalone illustration.
Question: Does the image appear as a comic art panel with narrative framing, including proper composition, lighting, and visual storytelling elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
