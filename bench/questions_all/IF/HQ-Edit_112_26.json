      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the original cat image into a collectible figurine box design. This implies that the cat should no longer be depicted as a live animal but instead as part of a boxed product. The box must be clearly visible, with the title \"Majestic Window\" present on it. The transformation must preserve the essence of the cat while repurposing it into a product form.",
      "question": "Is the cat depicted as part of a collectible figurine box design labeled \"Majestic Window\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies an isometric view for the box. This means the box must be rendered from a 3D perspective where all three axes (length, width, height) are visible at equal angles, commonly used in technical illustrations and product mockups. This style allows viewers to see the top, front, and side of the box simultaneously.",
      "question": "Is the figurine box shown in an isometric view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Floral-themed accents are explicitly mentioned. These should be visually identifiable elements such as flowers, leaves, or decorative patterns resembling flora integrated into the box’s design. They must be distinct and not merely background elements.",
      "question": "Are floral-themed decorative elements visible on the surface of the figurine box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires reimagining the cat as a glossy chibi figure inside the box. A chibi figure is characterized by exaggerated large head, small body, and stylized proportions. Glossy finish suggests reflective, smooth material like plastic or resin. The figure must be contained within the box.",
      "question": "Is there a glossy chibi-style cat figure inside the figurine box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The chibi figure must have sparkling blue glass-like eyes. This implies high reflectivity, bright blue coloration, and visual effects such as highlights or glints suggesting light reflection, mimicking real glass or gemstone material.",
      "question": "Do the eyes of the chibi cat figure appear sparkling and blue, resembling glass or gemstones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for displaying a realistic figure of the cat beside the box. This means a second representation of the cat—identical in appearance to the original—must be present outside the box, showing detailed fur texture and naturalistic features.",
      "question": "Is there a realistic depiction of the cat positioned next to the figurine box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The realistic figure must emphasize natural textures of fur and wooden surfaces. This means the fur should show fine detail, soft gradients, and realistic lighting; the wooden surface (likely the window sill) should display grain, warmth, and depth consistent with real wood.",
      "question": "Does the realistic cat figure display detailed fur texture and natural wood grain on the surrounding surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The overall presentation must serve as a lifelike product showcase. This includes proper lighting, shadows, composition, and clarity to make the product appear tangible and appealing, similar to professional product photography or marketing visuals.",
      "question": "Is the entire scene presented in a way that resembles a professional product showcase with realistic lighting and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
