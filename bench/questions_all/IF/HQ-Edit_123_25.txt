Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating a postcard series, which implies multiple distinct images derived from the original. The first subtask is confirming whether the final output contains three separate postcards as required. This must be verifiable by counting distinct visual compositions.
Question: Are there exactly three distinct postcards visible in the edited image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires a blue gradient to emphasize the dress in one of the postcards. This means that one of the three postcards must have a dominant blue color scheme with gradient effects applied specifically to highlight the garment's details.
Question: Is one of the postcards rendered with a blue gradient that emphasizes the embroidered dress?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for a postcard with silver tones highlighting the hair accessory. This means the metallic hairpin should appear in silver or monochromatic silver hues, with enhanced contrast or tonal treatment to stand out.
Question: Is one of the postcards rendered in silver tones, specifically emphasizing the hair accessory?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction requires a postcard with bamboo patterns. This implies that the background or design elements in one postcard must feature stylized bamboo motifs, possibly integrated with the paper-cut effect mentioned earlier.
Question: Does one of the postcards incorporate stylized bamboo patterns as a dominant visual element?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the three postcards are packed into a silk-bound collector book with an embroidery-inspired cover design. This means the final composition must include a book-like structure with a visible cover that features decorative embroidery-style patterns, suggesting texture and material akin to silk binding.
Question: Is the entire set of postcards presented within a silk-bound book whose cover features an embroidery-inspired design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction mentions using stylized paper-cut effects to enhance floral and scroll motifs. This implies that the embroidery patterns on the garment and any decorative elements should appear as if cut from paper, with clean edges, layered depth, and high contrast typical of paper-cut art.
Question: Do the floral and scroll motifs on the garment exhibit stylized paper-cut effects such as sharp edges, layered appearance, and high contrast?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
