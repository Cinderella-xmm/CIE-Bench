      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the jeweled butterfly into a plush toy made of soft fabrics. This implies a complete change in material from hard, reflective gemstones to soft, textile-based materials. The visual appearance should reflect fabric textures rather than metallic or crystalline surfaces.",
      "question": "Is the butterfly now made of soft fabric instead of metallic or gemstone materials?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The gemstones in the original image are replaced with embroidered patterns. Embroidery is a textile technique involving threadwork, so the surface should show stitched designs in vibrant blues and golds rather than faceted stones.",
      "question": "Are the decorative elements on the butterfly’s wings replaced with embroidered patterns in vibrant blue and gold colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly states that the wings should be made of velvety material. Velvet has a distinct soft, plush surface with a slight sheen, different from shiny or rough textures.",
      "question": "Do the wings of the butterfly appear to be made of a velvety material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Fluffy texture along the edges suggests a soft, fuzzy trim or fringe around the wing outlines, typical of plush toys. This must be visually distinguishable from smooth or sharp edges.",
      "question": "Are there fluffy or fuzzy textures visible along the edges of the butterfly's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The butterfly shape must be preserved despite material changes. This means the overall silhouette—wing span, body proportion, and antennae—should remain consistent with the original butterfly form.",
      "question": "Does the butterfly retain its original shape and proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The final placement requires the butterfly to rest on a plain pearl-white cushion. This means a soft, neutral-colored base must be present beneath the butterfly, contrasting with any background or surrounding elements.",
      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned atop a plain pearl-white cushion?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
