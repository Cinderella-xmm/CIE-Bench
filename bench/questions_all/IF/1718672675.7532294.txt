Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the cliffside into a mythical titan creature. This implies that the overall shape and structure of the cliff must now resemble a humanoid or monstrous figure with identifiable features such as a head, torso, limbs, or facial elements. The transformation should be visually coherent and clearly recognizable as a creature rather than just a rocky outcrop.
Question: Is the cliffside visibly shaped like a mythical titan creature with distinct anatomical features such as a head, body, or limbs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Jagged rock formations are to be reimagined as armor plating, suggesting a structured, segmented appearance resembling metal plates. Moss is specified as natural embellishment, so it should appear in patterns consistent with decorative or organic detailing on armor, such as along edges or seams.
Question: Do the jagged rock formations now resemble segmented armor plating, with moss growing along their edges or crevices as decorative elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The water below must be transformed into flowing spectral limbs. This means the sea should no longer appear as static water but instead take on translucent, ghostly forms that resemble arms or legs extending from the titan’s base, possibly glowing faintly or semi-transparent.
Question: Does the water below the cliff appear as translucent, flowing spectral limbs connected to the titan’s form?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Small trees are to form a textured mane. This indicates that the vegetation on top of or near the titan’s head or neck area should be arranged in a way that mimics hair or a mane—dense, layered, and flowing in directionality similar to fur or tresses.
Question: Are the small trees arranged in a dense, flowing pattern along the upper part of the titan’s head or neck, resembling a textured mane?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Runes must be carved into the rock surface. These should be visible inscriptions, likely stylized symbols or ancient-looking characters etched into the stone, adding a mystical or magical quality to the titan’s body.
Question: Are there visible carved runes or symbolic markings on the surface of the rock formations forming the titan?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Clouds must be replaced with ethereal, twisting spirits spiraling around the titan’s form. This means the sky should no longer contain normal clouds but instead feature swirling, luminous, spirit-like figures made of light or mist, moving in spiral patterns around the titan.
Question: Are the clouds replaced by glowing, twisting spirit-like forms spiraling around the titan’s body?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
