Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the individual into a chibi-style figurine. This implies a significant change in proportions—larger head relative to body, simplified facial features, and overall cartoonish scaling. The term "figurine" suggests a three-dimensional object resembling a statue or doll, not a flat image.
Question: Has the individual been transformed into a stylized figurine with a chibi aesthetic, featuring a large head and simplified proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies a "smooth porcelain finish" for the dress. This refers to a glossy, non-porous surface texture typical of ceramic materials, which should be visually distinct from fabric or painted surfaces.
Question: Does the dress exhibit a smooth, glossy porcelain-like surface texture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states that the dress must include vivid green and deep red colors with gold accents. These are specific color requirements that must be visible and dominant in the attire.
Question: Are the primary colors of the dress vivid green and deep red, with visible gold accents?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The presence of a miniature lamb in the lap is a required addition. The lamb must be small in scale relative to the figurine and positioned within the lap area. The instruction also specifies exaggerated fluffy wool, indicating that the wool should appear overly voluminous and soft.
Question: Is there a miniature lamb positioned in the figurine’s lap with visibly exaggerated, fluffy wool?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The figurine must be placed on an elegant base that mimics a renaissance painting backdrop. This implies a structured platform beneath the figurine, with background elements resembling classical European landscapes, architectural columns, or soft sky tones typical of Renaissance art.
Question: Is the figurine positioned on an elegant base that visually replicates a renaissance-style painting backdrop, including landscape and architectural elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
