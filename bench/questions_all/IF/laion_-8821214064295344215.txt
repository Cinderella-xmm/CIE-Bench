Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the teddy bears into mosaic figurines using small colorful tiles to mimic fur texture. This implies that the original knitted appearance must be replaced entirely by a mosaic pattern composed of small, distinct tiles, visible across the entire body including head, limbs, and torso.
Question: Are the teddy bears rendered as mosaic figurines made of small colorful tiles mimicking fur texture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The knitted sweaters in the original image are yellow and turquoise. The instruction requires replacing them with intricate tile patterns in the same hues. This means the sweater areas should no longer resemble knit fabric but instead display detailed mosaic designs in yellow and turquoise colors.
Question: Have the knitted sweaters been replaced with intricate tile patterns in yellow and turquoise hues?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Facial features such as eyes, nose, mouth, and snout must be recreated using subtly shaded tiles to preserve detail while maintaining the mosaic style. This includes ensuring that shading provides depth and definition without losing clarity.
Question: Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, snout) recreated using subtly shaded tiles to provide detail?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The bows on the bears' necks are specified to appear in glossy, smooth tiles for contrast against the textured mosaic fur. This means the bows should have a reflective, non-textured surface compared to the surrounding mosaic tiles.
Question: Do the bows appear in glossy, smooth tiles that contrast with the mosaic texture of the rest of the bears?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The final positioning requirement is to place the mosaic bears on a minimalistic white pedestal. This implies a clean, plain white base that elevates the figures and draws attention to their craftsmanship, contrasting with the original wooden surface and brick wall background.
Question: Are the mosaic bears positioned on a minimalistic white pedestal?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
