Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the king must be transformed into a water deity. This requires identifying visual elements associated with water—such as flowing robes, liquid-like textures, waves, or droplet patterns—and confirming they are present on the figure. The transformation should retain the general silhouette of a king but replace its original form with thematic aquatic features.
Question: Is the king piece now depicted as a regally robed water deity with visible fluid or wave-like motifs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The queen is to become a fire deity. This implies the presence of flame motifs such as flickering shapes, glowing orange/red tones (even in grayscale, texture and shape should suggest heat), and possibly dynamic, upward-reaching forms resembling flames. The robe should appear fiery or radiant.
Question: Is the queen piece now depicted as a regally robed fire deity with visible flame or ember-like motifs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Knights are to be transformed into stone golems. This requires a heavy, solid appearance with rough, carved surfaces resembling rock or stonework. Details like chiseled armor, cracks, or mineral textures should be visible. The overall shape should still resemble a knight but with a bestial or monolithic quality.
Question: Are the knight pieces now depicted as stone golems with carved armor and rocky textures?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Bishops are to become ethereal wind phantoms. This suggests translucent or semi-transparent forms, flowing lines, wispy textures, and possible motion blur or swirling patterns indicating air movement. They should not appear solid or dense like regular pieces.
Question: Are the bishop pieces now depicted as ethereal, translucent wind phantoms with swirling or flowing visual effects?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Pawns are to be transformed into shimmering, luminescent sprites. This implies small, delicate figures with glowing outlines, sparkles, or light emissions. They should appear magical and lightweight, contrasting with their original solid form.
Question: Are the pawn pieces now depicted as small, shimmering, and luminous sprites with glowing or reflective qualities?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Rooks are to become ancient, rune-covered trees. This requires tree-like structures—trunks, branches, bark texture—with visible runes or inscriptions etched into them. The form should resemble a tree rather than a tower, yet maintain the rook’s position on the board.
Question: Are the rook pieces now depicted as ancient trees with visible runes carved into their trunks?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: All pieces must remain in their original positions on the chessboard. While transformed, their placement relative to each other and the board squares should not change.
Question: Are all transformed pieces positioned in the same locations as the original chess pieces?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
