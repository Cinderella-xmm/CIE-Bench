      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the cathedral into a detailed wooden model. This implies a change in material from stone to wood, visible through texture, color, and structural representation. The model must be clearly scaled down and crafted to resemble wood.",
      "question": "Is the cathedral rendered as a miniature model made of warm-stained wood instead of stone?",

      "thinking_process": "The model must be displayed inside an ornate shadow box. This means the structure should be enclosed within a decorative frame or glass case, typically with a base and sides, possibly with intricate detailing on the frame itself.",
      "question": "Is the wooden cathedral model enclosed within an ornate shadow box with visible framing and a transparent front?",

      "thinking_process": "The use of 3D modeling to highlight intricate Gothic carvings in miniature form means that fine architectural details such as tracery, spires, gargoyles, and rose windows must be present and clearly defined even at small scale.",
      "question": "Are the Gothic architectural details, including pointed arches, flying buttresses, and rose window tracery, visibly detailed and accurately represented in miniature form?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Warm stained wood implies a rich brown or amber tone consistent with polished hardwoods like walnut or mahogany. The overall color palette should reflect this warmth, distinguishing it from gray stone.",
      "question": "Is the entire cathedral model colored in warm stained wood tones, avoiding stone-gray or cold metallic hues?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Tiny pews and chandeliers must be present inside the model to simulate an interior space. These elements should be proportionally small but recognizable as church furnishings.",
      "question": "Are there miniature pews and chandeliers visible inside the model cathedral?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "A clock mechanism at the back must be present, capable of moving small figures along a path. This implies mechanical components like gears or a rotating arm, and animated figures positioned along a track or timeline.",
      "question": "Is there a visible clock mechanism located at the back of the model, with small figures positioned along a path suggesting movement?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The moving figures should tell a story of timeless devotion. This narrative aspect is implied by their positioning and motion—possibly depicting scenes of prayer, worship, or religious rituals over time.",
      "question": "Do the small figures along the clock’s path depict actions related to religious devotion, such as kneeling, praying, or processions?",
