Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the tall building into a towering automaton. This implies replacing the original architectural form with a mechanical structure that has a sleek, white, armored appearance. The windows should be reimagined as mechanical apertures, suggesting non-organic, possibly glowing or segmented openings. The transformation must preserve the verticality and prominence of the original building but in a robotic form.
Question: Is the tall building replaced with a towering automaton featuring a sleek, white, armored body and mechanical windows as apertures?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The traditional Japanese roof of the lower building must be transformed into stylized shoulder pads. This involves altering the shape and texture of the roof to resemble mechanical armor components with visible intricate patterns, such as circuit-like lines, etched symbols, or geometric motifs typical of futuristic design.
Question: Has the traditional Japanese roof been converted into stylized shoulder pads with embedded intricate patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: All traffic signs in the scene (such as the red triangular "STOP" sign and pedestrian crossing signs) must be replaced with holographic symbols. These should appear translucent, floating, or emitting light, consistent with digital projections rather than physical signage.
Question: Are all traffic signs replaced with holographic symbols that appear to float or emit light?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The pedestrians in the scene must be altered into robotic figures with geometric designs. This includes modifying their human forms into mechanical constructs with angular limbs, visible joints, and patterned surfaces resembling circuitry or polygons.
Question: Are the pedestrians in the street replaced with robotic figures featuring geometric designs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The streetscape must be integrated with robotic elements and futuristic aesthetics. This includes changes to pavement, lighting, and surrounding structures to reflect a cybernetic environment—such as glowing lines, metallic textures, or embedded displays—while maintaining the general layout of the urban setting.
Question: Has the streetscape been altered to include robotic elements and geometric designs consistent with a futuristic urban environment?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
