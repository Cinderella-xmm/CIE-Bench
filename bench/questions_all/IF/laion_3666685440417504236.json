      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires miniaturizing the entire architectural ensemble. This means the original structure must be scaled down and transformed into a 3D representation, not merely resized or cropped. The key observable feature is whether the building appears smaller and modeled in three dimensions, consistent with a miniature.",
      "question": "Is the architectural ensemble rendered as a scaled-down 3D model?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The edited image must contain the architectural model placed inside a ceramic globe. The presence of a spherical boundary enclosing the scene, with visible ceramic texture and painted surface, is essential. The globe should clearly enclose the entire miniature scene.",
      "question": "Is the 3D architectural model contained within a spherical ceramic globe?",

      "question": "Are the turquoise dome and ornate arches visibly enhanced with golden highlights?",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall composition must reflect a harmonious blend of heritage and artistry. This can be assessed by whether the artistic elements (ceramic globe, Persian patterns, golden highlights) cohesively integrate with the historical architecture, creating a unified aesthetic rather than a disjointed collage.",
      "question": "Does the final composition present a visually cohesive blend of historical architecture and artistic design elements?",
