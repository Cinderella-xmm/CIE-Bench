      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The jewelry (necklace and bangles) must not be removed but transformed into ornate carved details on the stone, meaning they should appear as part of the sculpture’s surface, not as separate metallic objects.",
      "question": "Have the regal jewelry elements been converted into intricately carved stone details instead of remaining as separate accessories?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
