Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires cartoonizing the snowboarder, specifically by enlarging the helmet and hands to emphasize dynamism. This involves altering proportions beyond realism, making the helmet and hands visibly larger than natural scale relative to the body. The cartoon style should be evident through exaggerated features.
Question: Has the snowboarder's helmet been enlarged proportionally compared to their head and body?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies enlarging the hands as part of the cartoonization for dynamic effect. In a realistic image, hands are proportionate; in a cartoonized version, they should appear oversized to enhance motion and expressiveness.
Question: Have the snowboarder's hands been visibly enlarged compared to their arms and body?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for enhancing colors using bold, contrasting red and deep blue tones. This means the red ski suit should be vivid and saturated, and the background blues (snow, sky, trees) should be rich and deep, creating strong visual contrast.
Question: Are the red elements of the snowboarderâ€™s outfit vivid and highly saturated, contrasting sharply with the deep blue tones of the snowy environment?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A paper-cut effect implies sharp edges, layered appearance, and stylized silhouettes resembling cut-out paper pieces. This applies to both snow formations and trees, giving them a flat, textured look with defined borders.
Question: Do the snowdrifts and pine trees exhibit a paper-cut style with clean, angular edges and layered textures resembling cut paper?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction mentions including interchangeable action presets such as different snowboard tricks. While not visible in a single static image, this implies that multiple versions or overlays of the snowboarder performing different tricks should be present or implied within the design, possibly as layered options.
Question: Are multiple snowboarding poses or trick variations visible or indicated in the image as interchangeable action presets?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No

Q6:
Thinking process: The final presentation is described as being in a sleek, matte-covered collector's album with bold typography and winter sports motifs. This suggests the image is framed or embedded within an album-style layout featuring text elements and thematic designs related to winter sports.
Question: Is the image presented within a matte-finish collector's album layout that includes bold typography and winter sports-related decorative motifs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No
