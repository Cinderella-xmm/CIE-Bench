      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the gorilla into a wood-carved sculpture. This implies a complete change in material appearance—no fur, skin, or natural animal texture should remain. The entire form must resemble carved wood, with visible grain and sculpted edges.",
      "question": "Is the gorilla depicted as a wood-carved sculpture rather than a living animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Varying shades of brown are explicitly required to define body contours. This means gradients and depth must be created using different browns, not uniform color or non-brown hues like gray or black.",
      "question": "Are the contours of the gorilla's body defined using multiple shades of brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "\"Engrave detailed fur textures\" means that while the material is wood, the surface should have incised lines or patterns mimicking fur direction and density, not smooth or blank surfaces.",
      "question": "Are detailed fur-like textures engraved into the surface of the wooden sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "\"Smooth out the arms and legs\" refers to reducing anatomical details like knuckles or muscle definition to give a polished, stylized look typical of sculptures. This contrasts with realistic, textured limbs.",
      "question": "Are the arms and legs of the sculpture visibly smoother than the rest of the body, lacking fine anatomical detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The original background is a dense jungle. The instruction specifies replacing it with an etched wooden surface—meaning the background should now appear as carved wood with linear patterns resembling bark or grain, not real foliage.",
      "question": "Has the leafy backdrop been replaced with an etched wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction allows for a few scattered leaves in darker wood tones to preserve forest essence. These should be part of the wooden surface, not actual green leaves, and should be stylistically consistent with the carving.",
      "question": "Are there a few dark-toned leaf shapes integrated into the wooden background, matching the wood carving style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The gorilla’s posture and position must remain unchanged to maintain visual continuity. Even if transformed into a sculpture, its seated pose, hand-to-chin gesture, and orientation should be preserved.",
      "question": "Does the gorilla maintain the same seated posture and hand placement as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
