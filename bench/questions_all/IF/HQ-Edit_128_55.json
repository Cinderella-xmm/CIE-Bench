This implies that at least one or more of the black spherical knobs must be reimagined as glowing or reflective eyes, possibly with iridescent or luminous qualities, positioned in a way that suggests facial features.",
      "question": "Have the door’s metal knobs been transformed into shimmering, eye-like features with reflective or glowing properties?",
