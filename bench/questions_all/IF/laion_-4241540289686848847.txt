Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the character into a medieval alchemist. This implies a shift in visual identity consistent with historical or fantasy interpretations of alchemists—typically involving robes, mystical tools, and an aged or scholarly appearance. The key observable feature is whether the character's overall appearance now aligns with this role.
Question: Does the character visually resemble a medieval alchemist based on clothing, accessories, and demeanor?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly requires changing the attire to a rich velvet robe with arcane symbols. Velvet implies a textured, deep-colored fabric, and arcane symbols suggest mystical or esoteric patterns (e.g., pentagrams, sigils). These elements must be visible and correctly rendered.
Question: Is the character wearing a robe made of rich velvet material with visible arcane symbols on it?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for a fur-trimmed mantle as part of the attire. This is a specific accessory that should be clearly visible—fur trim typically appears along the edges of the robe or cloak, especially around the collar or shoulders.
Question: Does the character’s robe include a fur-trimmed mantle, visible along the edges?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The background must be changed to a mystic laboratory. This environment should contain identifiable elements such as ancient scrolls (possibly rolled or unrolled), bubbling potions in glass flasks, possibly lit by dim light, and other alchemical equipment like retorts or alembics.
Question: Is the background a mystic laboratory containing ancient scrolls and at least one bubbling potion?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The hairstyle must be modified to long, flowing silver locks. This contrasts sharply with the original golden ponytail. Silver color and length are essential; "flowing" suggests movement or loose strands rather than tied or short hair.
Question: Does the character have long, flowing silver hair?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The character must be equipped with a mystical staff carved with runic engravings. A staff should be present in hand or nearby, visibly detailed with runes or symbolic carvings. It should appear magical or ancient in design.
Question: Is the character holding or standing next to a mystical staff with visible runic engravings?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
