Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires miniaturizing the entire architectural ensemble. This means the original structure must be scaled down and transformed into a 3D representation, not merely resized or cropped. The key observable feature is whether the building appears smaller and modeled in three dimensions, consistent with a miniature.
Question: Is the architectural ensemble rendered as a scaled-down 3D model?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The edited image must contain the architectural model placed inside a ceramic globe. The presence of a spherical boundary enclosing the scene, with visible ceramic texture and painted surface, is essential. The globe should clearly enclose the entire miniature scene.
Question: Is the 3D architectural model contained within a spherical ceramic globe?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The turquoise dome and ornate arches must be preserved and enhanced with golden highlights. This implies that the dominant blue dome remains visible, and gold accents are added to architectural details such as edges, borders, or decorative elements.
Question: Are the turquoise dome and ornate arches visibly enhanced with golden highlights?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Inside the globe, the instruction specifies the inclusion of lush miniature palm trees. These should be small-scale, green, tree-like structures resembling palms, positioned within the interior space of the globe.
Question: Are there miniature palm trees visible inside the globe?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A cobblestone path must lead to the grand entrance inside the globe. This requires a clearly defined pathway made of irregular stone tiles, extending from the foreground toward the main entrance of the miniature structure.
Question: Is there a cobblestone path leading to the grand entrance inside the globe?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The exterior of the globe must be adorned with intricate Persian patterns. This refers to visible decorative motifs on the outer surface of the globe, such as geometric or floral designs typical of Persian art, possibly in blue, gold, or white tones.
Question: Is the exterior of the ceramic globe decorated with intricate Persian patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The overall composition must reflect a harmonious blend of heritage and artistry. This can be assessed by whether the artistic elements (ceramic globe, Persian patterns, golden highlights) cohesively integrate with the historical architecture, creating a unified aesthetic rather than a disjointed collage.
Question: Does the final composition present a visually cohesive blend of historical architecture and artistic design elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
