Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the hummingbird into an ethereal garden spirit. This implies a shift from a realistic bird to a magical, nature-infused entity. Key visual cues include non-realistic materials (like glass, crystals, vines) and luminous or glowing elements. The transformation must maintain the bird’s general shape but replace biological features with fantastical ones.
Question: Has the hummingbird been transformed into a non-biological, ethereal entity resembling a garden spirit rather than a realistic bird?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The wings must be replaced with iridescent glass-like structures that shimmer with all colors of the rainbow. This requires observing whether the wings now appear transparent, reflective, and display a spectrum of colors like a prism or stained glass.
Question: Do the wings of the hummingbird appear as iridescent, glass-like structures that display a full rainbow spectrum of shimmering colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Feathers are to be replaced with luminescent petals. This means the body surface should no longer show traditional feather texture but instead consist of glowing, flower-like elements that emit light or have a soft glow.
Question: Are the body feathers of the hummingbird replaced with glowing, petal-like structures that emit light or have a luminous appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The beak must be replaced with a crystalline spout exuding floral nectar. This involves checking if the beak is now made of clear, faceted crystal and if there is visible liquid (nectar) flowing from it, possibly in droplets or streams, with a floral scent implied by visual cues like floating pollen or flowers nearby.
Question: Has the beak been replaced with a transparent, crystalline spout from which a golden or honey-colored liquid (floral nectar) is visibly flowing?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The tail must be replaced with trailing vines and tiny blossoms. This means the tail feathers should no longer be present but instead transformed into plant-like tendrils with small flowers growing along them, extending naturally into the garden environment.
Question: Does the tail of the hummingbird consist of green, leafy vines with small blossoms growing along them, blending into the surrounding garden?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The transformation must enhance the hummingbird's connection with the garden. This includes visual harmony—such as color matching, thematic consistency (e.g., flowers, vines), and spatial integration (e.g., appearing to emerge from flora). It should not look like a foreign object inserted into the scene.
Question: Is the transformed hummingbird visually integrated into the garden environment, with colors, textures, and elements (like vines and petals) harmonizing with the surrounding flora?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
