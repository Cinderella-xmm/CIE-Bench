- Design a collectible art stamp featuring the couple in a semi-cartoon style
- The man's tuxedo and woman’s fur jacket should be slightly exaggerated
- Stylize the background with simplified linear motifs of the event's emblem
- Frame the scene with a decorative, ribbon-like border in gold
- Present the stamp on a blue envelope embossed with a minimalist pattern of the event's logo
- Maintain a sophisticated and memorable presentation

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the image into a semi-cartoon style, which implies visible stylistic changes such as simplified lines, rounded shapes, and exaggerated features. This must be distinguishable from a photorealistic representation.
Question: Is the couple depicted in a semi-cartoon style with simplified features and outlines?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the man's tuxedo and the woman’s fur jacket should be slightly exaggerated. Exaggeration in this context means increased proportions or stylized details (e.g., wider lapels, larger collar, longer fur trim) compared to realistic proportions.
Question: Are the man's tuxedo and the woman’s fur jacket visibly exaggerated in size or shape compared to their original appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The background must be stylized using simplified linear motifs based on the event's emblem (FIA Prize Giving 2013). This means the original detailed backdrop should be replaced with abstract line-based versions of the logo elements.
Question: Is the background composed of simplified linear representations of the FIA Prize Giving 2013 emblem rather than the original photograph?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A decorative, ribbon-like border in gold is required to frame the scene. This means a distinct golden ornamental border resembling a ribbon must surround the central image.
Question: Does the image feature a gold-colored, ribbon-like decorative border framing the scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The final presentation must be on a blue envelope embossed with a minimalist pattern of the event's logo. This implies the entire composition (the stamp) is placed on a blue surface with faint, repeated logos in relief or embossed style.
Question: Is the stamp presented on a blue envelope that has a subtle embossed pattern of the FIA Prize Giving 2013 logo?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
