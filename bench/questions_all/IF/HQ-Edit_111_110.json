      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the entire bookshelf and books into a LEGO structure. This means the original wooden furniture and books must be replaced entirely with LEGO bricks, maintaining the overall shape but changing material and construction style. The presence of LEGO elements should be visually distinct from wood.",
      "question": "Are the bookshelf and books fully constructed from LEGO bricks instead of wood?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires that the books be made of individually crafted LEGO blocks in earthy tones. Earthy tones include browns, tans, ochres, and muted reds. Each \"book\" should appear as a modular brick assembly resembling a book spine.",
      "question": "Are all books represented as individual LEGO blocks in earthy tones (e.g., brown, tan, terracotta)?",

      "question": "Are the intricate carvings on the original shelf and book spines replicated using darker LEGO bricks?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction states the tower should gradually taper at the top, meaning the width decreases progressively from bottom to top, forming a narrowing silhouette typical of a tower. This is a structural change from the original rectangular bookshelf.",
      "question": "Does the LEGO tower narrow progressively toward the top, forming a tapered shape?",

      "thinking_process": "The background must be plain and muted to emphasize the clean, modular form of the LEGO tower. This implies no patterned wallpaper, no decorative elements, and a neutral tone such as gray, beige, or off-white.",
      "question": "Is the background plain and muted, without any patterns or textures, to highlight the LEGO structure?",
