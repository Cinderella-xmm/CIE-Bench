      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the figure into an Art Deco-inspired bronze sculpture. This implies a shift in material appearance (to bronze), style (Art Deco features such as symmetry, sharp angles, and ornamentation), and texture (metallic sheen). The figure should no longer appear human but rather sculptural and stylized.",
      "question": "Is the figure rendered as a bronze sculpture with a metallic surface finish?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires elongated limbs to emphasize grace and movement. This means arms and legs should be visibly longer than natural proportions, especially in relation to the torso, to enhance the sense of fluidity and elegance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly states that legs should be extended into curves to create dynamic flow. This means the legs must follow curved, flowing lines rather than straight or natural anatomical shapes, contributing to a sense of motion and rhythm.",
      "question": "Do the legs form smooth, curved shapes that suggest dynamic movement?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Floral details in the original image (on boots and around legs) must be replaced with geometric patterns. These patterns should reflect Art Deco style—such as zigzags, chevrons, sunbursts, or symmetrical linear designs—and not resemble organic flowers.",
      "question": "Have all floral elements been replaced with geometric patterns consistent with Art Deco design?",

      "thinking_process": "The original color palette includes teal, red, and pink. The instruction requires maintaining this palette but in metallic tones. Therefore, colors should be transformed into metallic versions (e.g., teal → metallic teal, red → copper/bronze red, pink → rose gold).",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image rendered in metallic tones while preserving the original color scheme (teal, red, pink)?",

      "thinking_process": "The background must be set to a matching turquoise base to ensure cohesion. This means the backdrop should be a solid, uniform turquoise color that complements the metallic tones of the sculpture.",
      "question": "Is the background a solid, uniform turquoise color matching the overall aesthetic?",
