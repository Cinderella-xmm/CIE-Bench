      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the girl into a cartoon style. This implies simplified facial features, exaggerated proportions (such as large eyes or head), and smooth, stylized lines typical of cartoon art. The original image shows a realistic depiction, so verification must focus on whether these stylistic changes are present.",

      "thinking_process": "The lanterns in the original image are orange paper lanterns with Japanese characters. The instruction specifies replacing them with colorful balloons. This transformation involves changing shape (from cylindrical to spherical), material (paper to rubber-like), and color variety (to include multiple bright colors).",
      "question": "Have all the hanging lanterns been replaced with colorful spherical balloons of various bright colors?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The card titles must be set in bold, traditional fonts. This implies the presence of text elements (likely at the top or side of the postcard) using a font that resembles classical East Asian calligraphy or traditional typefaces, with strong stroke weight and cultural authenticity.",
      "question": "Are there visible card titles displayed in bold, traditional-style fonts (such as brush script or kanji-based typefaces) within the image?",

      "thinking_process": "The final output must be formatted as a collectible postcard. This includes a rectangular layout, clean edges, and visual design consistent with postcards (e.g., no excessive background clutter, balanced composition). The image should not appear as a full scene but rather as a curated card.",
