Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the house into a collectible board game asset. This implies the overall composition should resemble a game component—possibly scaled down, stylized, and presented as part of a game set. A key indicator is whether the object appears designed for tabletop use, with appropriate scale and context.
Question: Is the house presented as a standalone collectible game asset, positioned as if part of a board game scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: "Convert colors into earthy tones" means shifting from bright or vibrant hues (like the red roof) to muted browns, tans, greens, and grays typical of natural materials like soil, wood, and aged stone. This change must be visible across all surfaces.
Question: Have the colors of the house been changed to earthy tones such as browns, tans, and muted greens instead of bright reds and yellows?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Adding moss texture to the base enhances the sense of age and weathering. This involves visible greenish or grayish organic growth on the lower parts of the structure, especially near ground level.
Question: Is there visible moss texture applied to the base of the house, particularly along the foundation or lower walls?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Replacing stone textures with wooden planks indicates that any previously stone-like surfaces (e.g., pillars, corners, or walls) should now appear made of wood, with grain patterns and plank alignment.
Question: Have all stone textures (such as pillars and wall sections) been replaced with wooden plank textures showing visible grain and joints?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Miniature characters in fantasy roles (e.g., knights, wizards, goblins) must be present beside the building, clearly distinguishable in size and attire consistent with fantasy themes.
Question: Are there at least one or more miniature fantasy characters (e.g., knight, wizard, dwarf) placed beside the house?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The game title “Castle Quest” must appear on a parchment-style board beneath the house. This includes a textured background resembling aged paper, with legible text in a medieval or fantasy font.
Question: Is the text “Castle Quest” displayed on a parchment-style board located beneath the house?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: Detailed rule booklets imply small, folded paper-like objects with visible text or diagrams, positioned near the asset to suggest they are part of the game set.
Question: Are there one or more detailed rule booklets (small folded papers with visible text or illustrations) positioned beside the house?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
