This involves reimagining the physical elements (sand, water, netting, etc.) as parts of a creature's anatomy. The core transformation must be evident in the composition—specifically, the sand should no longer appear as just a beach but as part of a living form.",
      "question": "Is the sandy area reshaped and integrated into a creature-like form with a smooth, organic body structure?",
