Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the final output should be a three-panel manga page. This requires verifying whether the original single image has been transformed into a structured layout of three distinct panels arranged vertically or horizontally in manga format. The presence of clear panel borders and separation between scenes is essential.
Question: Is the edited image divided into three distinct panels arranged as a manga page?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The first panel must feature a close-up on the girl’s eyes and her grip on the katana. This means the focus should be tightly framed on her face and hand, emphasizing intensity and determination. Observable features include visible eyes, fingers wrapped around the hilt, and minimal background distraction.
Question: Does Panel 1 show a close-up of the girl's intense eyes and her hand gripping the katana?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The emotion in Panel 1 is specified as "determined." This can be evaluated by observing facial features such as narrowed eyes, tense eyebrows, and a firm mouth, indicating resolve. A neutral or smiling expression would not meet this requirement.
Question: Does the girl in Panel 1 display a determined facial expression (e.g., narrowed eyes, firm mouth)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The text box in Panel 1 must contain the exact phrase “I will rise beyond the phoenix blaze.” This is a verifiable textual element. The font style may vary, but the content must match exactly.
Question: Is the text box in Panel 1 containing the exact sentence: “I will rise beyond the phoenix blaze.”?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Panel 2 requires dynamic motion — the character leaping forward with fiery trails from her hair. This involves visual cues like motion blur, trailing flames, and an upward-forward pose. The emotion should include focus and a slight smirk, which can be observed through facial micro-expressions.
Question: Does Panel 2 depict the girl leaping forward with fiery trails emanating from her hair and a focused expression with a hint of a smirk?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The speech bubble in Panel 2 must contain the exact quote “No challenge too fierce!” This is a direct textual requirement. The placement should be near the character, clearly legible, and formatted as a speech bubble.
Question: Is there a speech bubble in Panel 2 with the exact text: “No challenge too fierce!”?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: Panel 3 must show the girl standing confidently with the katana pointed forward and colorful energy swirling around her. This includes visual effects such as glowing particles, radiant colors, and a heroic stance. The emotion should reflect triumph, indicated by an open posture, bright eyes, and a confident smile.
Question: Does Panel 3 show the girl standing with the katana pointing forward and colorful energy swirling around her, displaying a triumphant and confident expression?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: The speech bubble in Panel 3 must contain the exact quote “Witness my true power!” This is a specific textual instruction. It must be present and correctly placed.
Question: Is there a speech bubble in Panel 3 with the exact text: “Witness my true power!”?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q9:
Thinking process: The instruction requires vivid, contrasting backgrounds in all panels. This means each panel should have a distinct, high-contrast color scheme (e.g., green/yellow for Panel 1, red/orange for Panel 2, purple/pink for Panel 3) that enhances the mood and action.
Question: Do all three panels feature vivid, contrasting backgrounds that enhance the scene’s mood and action?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q10:
Thinking process: Bold outlines are required to accentuate action. This means that key elements such as the character, weapon, and motion lines should have thick, defined edges to emphasize movement and drama, typical of manga art style.
Question: Are bold outlines used throughout all panels to emphasize action and movement?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q11:
Thinking process: Each panel must have a 3:4 aspect ratio. This is a technical constraint that ensures consistency in layout. The height-to-width ratio of each panel must be exactly 3:4.
Question: Does each of the three panels have an aspect ratio of 3:4?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q12:
Thinking process: The title “Flame’s Journey to Glory” must appear at the top of the manga page. This is a structural requirement. The title should be visible above the panels, likely in a stylized font.
Question: Is the title “Flame’s Journey to Glory” displayed at the top of the manga page?
Choices: Yes, No
