Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire plush seahorse into a glass sculpture. This implies that the original soft, textile material must be replaced entirely with glass, maintaining the overall shape but changing the material properties. The transformation should result in a non-plush, rigid, and transparent or semi-transparent form.
Question: Is the seahorse made entirely of glass material instead of plush fabric?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The pink fabric of the seahorse's body must be replaced with translucent pink glass. Translucency means light can pass through but not clearly, and "subtle bubble texture" refers to small internal imperfections resembling bubbles within the glass, commonly seen in hand-blown glass art.
Question: Does the body of the seahorse have a translucent pink glass appearance with visible subtle bubble textures?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The yellow belly section must be changed from soft fabric to opaque yellow glass. Opaque means no light passes through, and the music note must be etched (engraved) into the surface, indicating a physical indentation or frosted design rather than a printed symbol.
Question: Is the belly section made of opaque yellow glass with an etched music note design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The original purple ribbons on the head and fins are fabric. The instruction specifies replacing them with lavender glass ribbons. Lavender glass would have a similar hue but be transparent or semi-transparent, matching the glass aesthetic of the rest of the sculpture.
Question: Are the ribbons on the head and fins made of lavender-colored glass instead of fabric?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The final placement requirement is to put the sculpture on a reflective black display stand. This stand should be visibly black and capable of reflecting the object, enhancing its elegance. It should be distinct from the background and support the sculpture upright.
Question: Is the seahorse placed on a reflective black display stand?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
