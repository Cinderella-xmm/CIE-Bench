Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the spaceship into a Greek amphora painting, which implies replacing its current sci-fi appearance with visual elements characteristic of ancient Greek pottery—specifically black-figure or red-figure styles. This includes using silhouetted forms, geometric patterns, and mythological or decorative motifs typical of such art. The spaceship should no longer resemble a futuristic vehicle but instead appear as if painted on an amphora.
Question: Is the spaceship visually transformed into a style resembling a Greek amphora painting, with flat, stylized forms and decorative borders?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Stylized circular motifs are a key feature of Greek pottery, especially in the depiction of wheels, suns, or floral patterns. These should be visible on the surface of the spaceship to reflect the required artistic style. Their presence must be clearly observable as part of the ship's design.
Question: Are there visible stylized circular motifs incorporated into the design of the spaceship?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Intricate meanders (also known as Greek key patterns) are iconic in ancient Greek art and often frame scenes or decorate borders. The instruction specifies their inclusion, so they should be present as part of the spaceship’s surface decoration.
Question: Does the spaceship include intricate meander patterns as part of its design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The landscape below must be altered from its realistic form into elongated abstract waves. This means the terrain, roads, and natural features should no longer follow real-world proportions or shapes but should instead flow in wave-like, exaggerated curves that mimic the undulating lines seen in ancient pottery designs.
Question: Has the landscape below been transformed into elongated abstract waveforms rather than realistic terrain?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Muted earth tones (such as ochre, terracotta, beige, olive green, and dark brown) are characteristic of ancient pottery pigments. The instruction specifies these colors to maintain authenticity to the Greek amphora aesthetic. The color palette of the entire landscape should reflect this.
Question: Is the color palette of the landscape composed primarily of muted earth tones consistent with ancient pottery?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: While the style changes dramatically, the overall composition—such as the spaceship hovering above a central pathway leading into the distance—should remain intact. The transformation should not distort the spatial relationship between the spaceship and the landscape unless specified otherwise.
Question: Has the spatial relationship between the spaceship and the landscape been preserved despite the stylistic changes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
