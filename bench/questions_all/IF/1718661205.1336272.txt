- Transform the military ship and ocean scene into a LEGO diorama
- Use gray and blue bricks for the ship body and waves
- Construct the boat’s deck using small, detailed LEGO accessories
- Replace the life vest and shirt with LEGO textures and shapes, retaining their colors
- Position this LEGO model within a minimalist shelf display to highlight craftsmanship

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire scene into a LEGO diorama, which means all elements including the ship, ocean, and surrounding environment must be constructed from LEGO bricks. This transformation involves replacing real-world materials with block-like LEGO structures, maintaining proportions and spatial relationships.
Question: Is the military ship constructed entirely from LEGO bricks, with visible brick patterns and modular construction?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The ocean must be represented using LEGO bricks, specifically in blue tones to simulate water. This implies the use of blue LEGO pieces arranged to mimic wave patterns or surface texture.
Question: Are the ocean waves depicted using blue LEGO bricks, forming a textured surface resembling water?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The deck of the boat must be built using small, detailed LEGO accessories such as railings, hatches, or other structural components typical of LEGO sets. These should be visibly distinct from plain brickwork.
Question: Is the boat’s deck composed of small, detailed LEGO accessories such as railings, panels, or equipment that replicate real deck features?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The life vest and shirt must be replaced with LEGO-style textures and shapes while preserving their original colors (e.g., olive green for the vest, beige for the shirt). This means the clothing should appear pixelated or blocky, consistent with LEGO minifigure design.
Question: Are the life vest and shirt replaced with LEGO-textured clothing that retains their original colors but has a blocky, brick-like appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The entire LEGO model must be placed within a minimalist shelf display, which implies a clean, neutral background with a shelf or platform supporting the diorama, possibly with soft lighting to emphasize craftsmanship.
Question: Is the LEGO diorama positioned on a minimalist shelf with a clean, uncluttered background that highlights the model's details?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
