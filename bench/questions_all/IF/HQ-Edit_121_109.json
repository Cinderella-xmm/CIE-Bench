      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the hummingbird into an ethereal garden spirit. This implies a shift from a realistic bird to a magical, nature-infused entity. Key visual cues include non-realistic materials (like glass, crystals, vines) and luminous or glowing elements. The transformation must maintain the bird’s general shape but replace biological features with fantastical ones.",
      "question": "Has the hummingbird been transformed into a non-biological, ethereal entity resembling a garden spirit rather than a realistic bird?",

      "thinking_process": "The wings must be replaced with iridescent glass-like structures that shimmer with all colors of the rainbow. This requires observing whether the wings now appear transparent, reflective, and display a spectrum of colors like a prism or stained glass.",

      "question": "Are the body feathers of the hummingbird replaced with glowing, petal-like structures that emit light or have a luminous appearance?",

      "thinking_process": "The beak must be replaced with a crystalline spout exuding floral nectar. This involves checking if the beak is now made of clear, faceted crystal and if there is visible liquid (nectar) flowing from it, possibly in droplets or streams, with a floral scent implied by visual cues like floating pollen or flowers nearby.",
      "question": "Has the beak been replaced with a transparent, crystalline spout from which a golden or honey-colored liquid (floral nectar) is visibly flowing?",

      "thinking_process": "The tail must be replaced with trailing vines and tiny blossoms. This means the tail feathers should no longer be present but instead transformed into plant-like tendrils with small flowers growing along them, extending naturally into the garden environment.",
      "question": "Does the tail of the hummingbird consist of green, leafy vines with small blossoms growing along them, blending into the surrounding garden?",

      "thinking_process": "The transformation must enhance the hummingbird's connection with the garden. This includes visual harmony—such as color matching, thematic consistency (e.g., flowers, vines), and spatial integration (e.g., appearing to emerge from flora). It should not look like a foreign object inserted into the scene.",
      "question": "Is the transformed hummingbird visually integrated into the garden environment, with colors, textures, and elements (like vines and petals) harmonizing with the surrounding flora?",
