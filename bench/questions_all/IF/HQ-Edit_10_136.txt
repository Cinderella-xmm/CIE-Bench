Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires cartoonizing the girl, specifically emphasizing gentle play and an enlarged strumming hand. This involves stylization of facial features, limbs, and proportions typical of cartoon art, with the right hand visibly larger than normal to emphasize motion. The overall effect should be playful yet recognizable as the original subject.
Question: Is the girl depicted in a cartoonized style with exaggerated features and an enlarged strumming hand?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The wall posters must be enhanced with vibrant band logos using watercolor techniques. This implies visible brushstroke textures, color bleeding, and translucent layers characteristic of watercolor painting, applied to existing band-related imagery (e.g., "GERLESIES", "KING IN JAPAN").
Question: Are the wall posters enhanced with vibrant band logos rendered in a watercolor style, showing visible brushwork and color diffusion?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: A whimsical cat silhouette must be added in pastel colors on the bed. "Whimsical" suggests a playful or stylized shape (not realistic), and "pastel" refers to soft hues like mint, lavender, or peach. The silhouette should be clearly visible against the bedding.
Question: Is there a whimsical cat silhouette in pastel colors present on the bed?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A small, decorative writing box must be overlaid on the bedside table. It should be distinct from the bottle and pencil already present—likely ornate, possibly with patterns or embellishments—and positioned on top of or near the table surface.
Question: Is there a small, decorative writing box placed on the bedside table?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The overall image should reflect a cozy bedroom-themed art postcard. This includes warm lighting, soft textures (like the fluffy rug and fur pillow), and a harmonious composition suggesting comfort and creativity. The style should feel curated and artistic, not literal.
Question: Does the image maintain a cozy bedroom atmosphere with warm lighting, soft textures, and an artistic postcard-like composition?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
