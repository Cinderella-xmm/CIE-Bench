Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the person into a vintage doll with articulated limbs. This means the figure should no longer appear human but instead resemble a stylized, jointed doll with visible articulation points (e.g., at shoulders, elbows, hips, knees). The form should reflect a toy-like aesthetic, not a realistic human.
Question: Does the edited image show the person transformed into a vintage doll with visible articulated limbs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The outfit must be antiquated and consistent with the original attire but adapted to a doll form. The gown should retain the same color palette and general silhouette but be rendered in a style appropriate for a doll’s clothing—possibly simplified or stylized.
Question: Is the doll wearing an antiquated outfit that matches the style and colors of the original attire?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The gown must be elegantly patterned and replicate the current attire. This includes maintaining the floral or ornamental patterns seen in the original dress, now transferred onto the doll’s garment.
Question: Does the doll’s gown feature an intricate pattern that replicates the design of the original dress?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Delicate lace must be added around the collar. This is a specific decorative element that must be visibly present on the neckline of the gown, resembling fine lace trim typical of Victorian fashion.
Question: Is there delicate lace visible around the collar of the doll’s gown?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A small velvet hat must be affixed to the doll’s head. This is a distinct accessory that should be clearly visible, made of a material resembling velvet, and positioned appropriately on the head.
Question: Does the doll have a small velvet hat placed on its head?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The background must be a miniature Victorian street scene. This includes scaled-down buildings, narrow streets, and period-appropriate architecture. The scale should suggest miniaturization.
Question: Is the background a miniature Victorian street scene with reduced-scale buildings and architecture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: Cobblestone textures must be present in the street surface. This is a key detail for authenticity in a Victorian setting, requiring visible stone paving.
Question: Are cobblestone textures visible on the ground in the background?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: Period-specific elements like gas lamps and horse-drawn carriages must be included. These are iconic features of Victorian-era urban environments and must be recognizable in the scene.
Question: Are gas lamps and horse-drawn carriages visible in the background?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
