Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating a sports-themed art postcard featuring the basketball player in mid-dribble. This requires verifying that the player is captured in a dribbling motion (not stationary or shooting), and that the overall composition resembles a postcard format—likely rectangular with clear focus on the subject and thematic elements.
Question: Is the basketball player depicted in a mid-dribble pose with the ball near the ground and body in motion?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires converting the scene to a stylized comic book look. Key features of comic book style include bold black outlines around figures and objects, exaggerated proportions, and dynamic lines suggesting movement. These are observable visual traits.
Question: Are bold black outlines present around the basketball player, the ball, and other key elements such as the hoop and court?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Dynamic action lines are a hallmark of comic book art, used to convey motion and energy. These typically appear as streaks or radiating lines around moving parts like limbs or the ball.
Question: Are there visible dynamic action lines around the player’s legs, arms, or the basketball to emphasize motion?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for enhancing colors with vibrant red and orange hues. This means dominant color palette should feature saturated reds and oranges, especially in the jersey, background lighting, or highlights.
Question: Are the dominant colors in the image vibrant shades of red and orange, particularly in the player’s uniform and surrounding lighting?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Retro-inspired text overlays must be present, indicating a fictional game title. This implies readable text in a stylized font typical of 1970s–1980s design (e.g., blocky, bold, with drop shadows or gradients).
Question: Is there visible text overlaid on the image in a retro-style font that suggests a fictional game title (e.g., "Hoops Fever '87")?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction requires framing the postcard with a classic comic panel border. This refers to a thick, often double-lined rectangular border resembling those found in vintage comic books, possibly with corner embellishments.
Question: Does the entire image have a distinct comic panel border (e.g., a thick frame with possible decorative corners) surrounding it?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
