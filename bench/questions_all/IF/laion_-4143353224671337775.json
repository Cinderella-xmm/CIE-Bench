This means the entire structure must be composed of visible, interlocking puzzle pieces rather than a solid ceramic form. The transformation must be complete and not just partial.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes creating a smooth, continuous shape by aligning the puzzle edges. This implies that the edges of the puzzle pieces should fit together seamlessly without gaps or misalignment, forming a cohesive surface.",
      "question": "Are the puzzle piece edges aligned smoothly to create a continuous surface without visible gaps?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The conical top of the original object must be replaced with a smooth green-colored puzzle fragment. This involves both a change in shape (from conical to flat/smooth) and color (to green), while maintaining the puzzle piece style.",
