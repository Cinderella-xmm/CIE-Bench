      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly requires replacing the sandy beach background with a flat white studio background. This is a clear environmental change that must be objectively verifiable by observing the background color and texture. A white, featureless, evenly lit background indicates a studio setting, which contrasts with the original natural beach scene.",
      "question": "Is the background of the image now a flat white studio background instead of a sandy beach?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies adding a small brand logo tag stitched on the hippo’s ear using soft blue thread. This involves both placement (ear) and material detail (soft blue thread), which are observable features. The presence of a visible, small, blue-stitched tag on the ear confirms compliance.",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires a circular embroidered brand patch on the hippo’s side. This is a distinct visual element that can be identified by shape (circular), texture (embroidered), and location (side of the hippo). Its presence must be confirmed visually.",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies a transparent plastic window on the front of the packaging box to showcase the toy inside. This implies a clear, see-through section on the box that reveals the toy, indicating a functional design element typical of product packaging.",
      "question": "Does the packaging box have a transparent plastic window on the front that allows the toy to be seen inside?",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction mandates maintaining the plush hippo in tiger stripes and the knitted beach ball as central subjects. This means these two items must remain intact, recognizable, and prominently featured in the final image.",
