Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the entire scene into a "whimsical miniature scene inside a shadow box." This implies that the image should appear framed, with depth and scale reduction to suggest a diorama or enclosed display. The presence of a visible border or glass-like surface indicating enclosure is essential for this effect.
Question: Is the cat and surrounding elements contained within a transparent or framed shadow box structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the creation of a 3D-rendered vintage theatre setting. This includes architectural elements such as stage-like structures, lighting fixtures, or theatrical decor consistent with a classic performance space. The environment must convey depth and a sense of staging.
Question: Are there visible elements of a 3D-rendered vintage theatre, such as a stage, proscenium, or theatrical lighting?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The original settee must be transformed into a regal throne, meaning it should have royal attributes such as elevated height, ornate carvings, a backrest resembling a crown or royal insignia, and possibly a more imposing silhouette than the original furniture.
Question: Has the red settee been transformed into a throne-like structure with regal features such as raised back, golden embellishments, or crown motifs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Velvet curtains framing the backdrop are explicitly mentioned. These should be visible on either side of the scene, likely drawn back slightly to reveal the interior, and made of a rich, textured fabric typical of theatre settings.
Question: Are there deep red or dark velvet curtains visible on both sides of the scene, framing the background?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Tiny gilded columns are required to surround the scene. These should be proportionally smaller than the main objects, gold in color, and arranged around the perimeter of the scene to create an opulent, classical atmosphere.
Question: Are there small, golden columns positioned around the edges of the scene, matching the scale of a miniature diorama?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Small hanging portraits of mice must be added. These should be depicted as framed images suspended from above or attached to walls/columns, showing mice in stylized or formal poses, consistent with the theme of immortalizing the cat as a ruler.
Question: Are there small framed portraits of mice hanging within the scene, displayed as if part of a royal gallery?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The overall narrative of the cat as a "majestic ruler of its gilded kingdom" implies a thematic consistency: the cat should be centrally positioned, elevated or dominant in posture, with visual cues such as a crown, scepter, or regal expression. The environment must support this narrative through grandeur and symbolic elements.
Question: Does the cat appear as a dominant, elevated figure within the scene, surrounded by elements that suggest royal authority (e.g., throne, portraits, gilded details)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
