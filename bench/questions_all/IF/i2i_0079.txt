Q1:
Thinking process: The collectible figure should be clearly visible and identifiable as an object that can serve as a desk ornament. It must visibly integrate within the area surrounding the mirror and drawer cabinet without disrupting their placement or the balance of the room. 
Question: Is there a clearly defined collectible figure present in the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Since the collectible figure is intended to act as a desk ornament, it should be placed on a surface that makes sense for such an item, typically on top of the drawer cabinet or near the existing objects.
Question: Is the collectible figure placed on a surface suitable for a desk ornament?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The figure needs to harmonize visually with the rest of the scene. Elements such as its size, color, and style should complement the modern simplicity of the room, the black dresser, and the round mirror.
Question: Does the collectible figure maintain visual harmony with the overall composition of the room?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: To ensure the figure functions as an aesthetic accent rather than a disruptive element, it should not obscure important components of the scene like the mirror or overshadow existing decorative items.
Question: Does the collectible figure obscure or overshadow key elements such as the mirror or existing decorations?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No

Q5:
Thinking process: The editing should result in a cohesive appearance where the newly added collectible figure seems like a natural part of the environment, not an afterthought or separate entity.
Question: Does the collectible figure appear seamlessly integrated into the scene as though it is a natural part of the composition?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
