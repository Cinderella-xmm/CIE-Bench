      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the original 2D poster image of Aquaman into a compact 3D model. This implies a shift from flat imagery to a volumetric representation with depth and dimensionality, suitable for display as a physical or digital model.",
      "question": "Is the Aquatic warrior rendered as a three-dimensional model rather than a flat 2D image?",

      "question": "Is the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior enclosed within a dome that features marine-themed decorations?",

      "thinking_process": "The armor must be detailed in metallic blue tones. This means the color scheme should be predominantly blue with metallic sheen, reflecting light like polished metal, and preserving the intricate patterns visible in the original armor design.",
      "question": "Is the armor of the Aquatic warrior rendered in metallic blue tones with visible reflective highlights?",

      "thinking_process": "The trident must retain its imposing stature, meaning it should remain large and prominent relative to the figure, not reduced in scale or simplified in form, even in the compact 3D model.",
      "question": "Does the trident maintain its large, dominant size and detailed structure relative to the Aquatic warrior's body?",

      "thinking_process": "The model must be positioned on a faux coral reef base, which implies a textured, organic-looking foundation resembling underwater coral formations, possibly with varied shapes and colors mimicking real coral.",
      "question": "Is the 3D model placed on a base that resembles a coral reef made of artificial or stylized coral structures?",

      "thinking_process": "Swirling, miniature ocean currents must surround the figure to suggest motion and dynamic movement. These should appear as translucent, flowing lines or ribbons of water, possibly with particle effects, simulating underwater flow.",
      "question": "Are there swirling, miniature water currents visible around the figure, suggesting dynamic movement?",
