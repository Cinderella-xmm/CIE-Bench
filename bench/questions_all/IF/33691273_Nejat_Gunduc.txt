Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the man into a noir detective. This implies specific visual cues such as trench coat, fedora (or similar hat), cigarette, shadowed lighting, and a contemplative or pensive expression. The original image shows a man wearing a beanie and holding earphones; therefore, the edited version must replace his appearance and posture to reflect classic noir detective traits.
Question: Is the man depicted wearing a trench coat and a fedora-style hat consistent with a noir detective?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies a contemplative pose for the detective. This means he should not be actively interacting with the environment but rather looking off into the distance, possibly with one hand on his chin or holding a cigarette, suggesting deep thought.
Question: Is the man in a contemplative pose, such as looking away thoughtfully or touching his face/chin?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The background must be transformed into an eerie urban scene, which typically includes dimly lit streets, rain-slicked pavement, neon signs, alleyways, or abandoned buildings. These elements are distinct from the original billboard and wall setting.
Question: Does the background feature an eerie urban environment with elements such as dark alleys, wet pavement, or dim lighting?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly mentions adding the text "Coca-Cola Noir" in a vintage font. This requires both the presence of the text and its stylistic execution—such as serif typeface, faded or aged appearance, and placement that fits the comic strip aesthetic.
Question: Is the text "Coca-Cola Noir" visible in the image using a vintage-style font?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Thought bubbles are required to convey the detective’s internal monologue about the mystery. These should appear near the man’s head and contain text or symbols indicating curiosity, suspicion, or clues related to the scene.
Question: Are there thought bubbles present near the man’s head containing text or imagery related to the mystery of the scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The overall style must be a surreal, monochrome comic strip. This involves black-and-white tones, panel-like framing, exaggerated proportions, or stylized lines typical of comics, combined with surreal juxtapositions (e.g., real person next to cartoonish elements).
Question: Is the image rendered in monochrome and styled like a comic strip, with clear panel borders or stylized line work?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The juxtapositional theme refers to placing contrasting elements side by side—such as a realistic detective next to a surreal or overly idealized advertisement. The original image already has this contrast between the man and the Coca-Cola ad; the edit must enhance this contrast within a comic format.
Question: Is there a clear visual juxtaposition between the noir detective and the stylized advertisement figure, reinforcing the surreal theme?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
