      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the iceberg-inspired ice tower should be pixelated with circuit-like textures. This requires identifying whether the tall ice structure has been replaced with a digital-style rendering featuring blocky pixels and visible circuitry patterns such as glowing lines or grid structures, consistent with a futuristic digital theme.",
      "question": "Is the tall ice tower in the foreground rendered with pixelated textures and visible circuit-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The Sydney Opera House must be depicted in neon line art, meaning its silhouette should be outlined with glowing, thin, luminous lines resembling neon tubing, possibly with color gradients or glow effects typical of digital neon displays, while losing solid fills.",
      "question": "Is the Sydney Opera House represented using glowing neon lines instead of solid surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The ocean must be transformed into geometric wave patterns, implying that natural water textures are replaced with repeating angular or polygonal shapes forming wave-like motion, likely in a stylized, abstract digital format.",
      "question": "Are the waves in the ocean composed of geometric shapes rather than realistic water ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The vivid frozen drink must be preserved but rendered as a holographic image. This means it should appear translucent, slightly floating, with light refraction effects, soft edges, or layered visual depth suggesting projection, while still retaining its original appearance (color, ice cubes, straw).",
      "question": "Does the drink on the left appear as a transparent, floating hologram with visible depth and light distortion effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The overall scene must reflect a futuristic digital display aesthetic. This includes consistency across all elements—pixelation, neon outlines, geometric patterns—and integration into a cohesive digital environment without conflicting styles.",
      "question": "Does the entire scene exhibit a unified futuristic digital aesthetic, with all elements (ice tower, Opera House, ocean, drink) transformed according to their specified styles?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
