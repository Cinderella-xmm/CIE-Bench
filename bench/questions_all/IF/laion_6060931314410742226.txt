Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the rose bush into a mosaic mural. This implies that the entire rose bush should no longer appear as natural flora but as a composed artwork made of individual tiles, forming a larger image. A mosaic mural is characterized by discrete, tessellated elements forming a unified visual.
Question: Is the rose bush rendered as a mosaic mural composed of distinct tile-like segments?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies outlining each flower with bold, ceramic tile borders. This means that every floral element must be clearly demarcated by thick, visible lines resembling ceramic tile edges, which are typically sharp and uniform.
Question: Are all flowers outlined with bold, distinct borders resembling ceramic tile edges?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Petals and leaves must be rendered in pearl and jade hues. Pearl suggests soft white or off-white tones with a subtle luster, while jade refers to greenish tones ranging from pale to medium green, possibly with translucency or smooth texture. These colors must replace the original natural colors.
Question: Are the petals and leaves depicted in shades of pearl (soft white/off-white) and jade (greenish tones), replacing their original colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The red brick building must be abstracted using terracotta tile shades. This means the original red bricks should be replaced with coloration and texture resembling terracotta tiles—typically warm earthy tones like orange-brown or rust—and the structure should not retain realistic brickwork appearance.
Question: Has the red brick building been abstracted using terracotta tile shades (warm earthy tones) instead of realistic red bricks?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Architectural motifs such as arches, windows, or decorative stonework must be integrated into the mosaic pattern to maintain visual continuity between the building and the mural. This implies that these features should not be erased but transformed into part of the mosaic design, preserving recognizable shapes within the tiled aesthetic.
Question: Are architectural features of the building (such as arches or window frames) incorporated into the mosaic pattern as stylized elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
