      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the central figure into a Maasai warrior painting. This implies a shift from a realistic depiction to a stylized, artistic representation typical of traditional or symbolic paintings, including flatness of form, strong outlines, and culturally significant iconography associated with Maasai warriors (e.g., shield, spear, specific posture). The figure should no longer appear photorealistic but rather painted in a style resembling traditional African art.",
      "question": "Is the central figure rendered in a painted style consistent with a Maasai warrior artwork, featuring stylized features and symbolic representation?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires adding intricate patterns to the blue garment using historical Maasai motifs. These motifs typically include geometric shapes such as triangles, zigzags, and stripes, often arranged symmetrically and symbolizing aspects of Maasai culture like bravery, unity, or nature. The patterns must be visibly integrated into the fabric of the garment.",
      "question": "Are intricate geometric patterns based on historical Maasai designs visible on the blue garment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction states that bead ornaments should be retained but enhanced with glowing elements. This means all original beadwork (necklaces, headpiece, arm bands) must remain present, but now emit light or have luminous effects such as soft glows, halos, or internal illumination, suggesting a magical or enhanced aesthetic while preserving their original structure.",
      "question": "Do the bead ornaments (necklace, headpiece, arm bands) retain their original form but include visible glowing or luminous effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The background must be depicted as an expansive African savannah in the style of an oil painting. This implies visible brush strokes, texture, and depth typical of oil painting techniques, not a photograph or digital render. The scene should show open grasslands, scattered acacia trees, distant hills, and sky, all rendered with painterly qualities.",
      "question": "Is the background rendered in the style of an oil painting, showing visible textured brush strokes and a painterly quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies bold contrasting colors and textured brush strokes to emphasize cultural and natural essence. Bold contrasts mean high chromatic differences (e.g., deep greens against ochre yellows, rich blues against earth tones), and textures suggest impasto or layered paint effects. These elements together should evoke both the environment and cultural richness.",
      "question": "Does the background feature bold contrasting colors (such as vibrant greens, deep browns, and bright skies) combined with visible textured brush strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
