- Transform the military truck into an elaborate crystal sculpture with reflective emerald and jade facets
- Replace the muddy wheels with transparent quartz, enhancing their intricate detailing
- Shape the truck's cabin and body with layered crystal planes to catch and refract colors
- Position the crystal truck on a sleek, white marble platform for a striking exhibit
- Ensure all surfaces of the truck exhibit reflective, faceted crystal textures consistent with emerald and jade materials
- Maintain the overall structure and proportions of the original truck while applying crystal transformation
- The quartz wheels must be fully transparent and detailed with visible internal crystalline patterns
- The white marble platform must be smooth, clean, and contrast sharply with the crystal truck

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire military truck into a crystal sculpture. This involves replacing the metallic and painted surfaces with reflective, faceted crystal material in emerald and jade tones. The key observable feature is whether the truck's body now consists of geometric crystal planes rather than solid metal panels.
Question: Is the entire body of the truck composed of layered, reflective crystal planes resembling emerald and jade facets?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The original wheels are muddy and made of rubber/steel. The instruction specifies replacing them with transparent quartz that has intricate detailing. This means the wheels should appear clear, with visible internal crystalline structures, not opaque or dirty.
Question: Are the wheels transparent and made of quartz with visible internal crystalline patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states that the truck should be positioned on a sleek, white marble platform. This implies a clean, polished surface beneath the vehicle that contrasts with the crystal truck and is distinct from the original muddy ground.
Question: Is the truck placed on a smooth, white marble platform?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The cabin and body must be shaped using layered crystal planes to allow light refraction and color reflection. This means the surfaces should not be flat or matte but instead have angular, multifaceted geometry typical of cut gemstones.
Question: Do the cabin and body surfaces feature angular, faceted crystal planes that reflect and refract light?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The transformation must preserve the general shape and proportions of the original truck while changing its material. This includes maintaining the cab placement, cargo area size, and wheelbase alignment, even if rendered in crystal.
Question: Does the crystal truck maintain the original structural proportions and layout of the military truck?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
