      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the chicken wings into plush toy replicas made of golden-brown fabric with a slightly crunchy texture. This implies that the wings should no longer resemble cooked meat but instead appear soft, stitched, and textile-like, with visible seams or texture resembling fabric. The color should be golden-brown, consistent with the original but interpreted as fabric.",
      "question": "Are the chicken wings replaced with plush toy replicas made of golden-brown fabric that have a slightly crunchy texture?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The sauce must be replaced with a soft, textured pillow in bright orange. This means the small bowl containing sauce should now contain a pillow-shaped object that is soft, has visible texture (like stitching or fabric weave), and is bright orange in color to mimic the sauceâ€™s hue.",
      "question": "Is the sauce replaced with a soft, textured pillow in bright orange?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The background surface must be changed to a smooth, light-colored wooden surface. This involves replacing the current dark blue surface with one that appears light in tone (such as beige, cream, or pale wood) and has a smooth, polished finish typical of wood, contrasting with the plush elements.",
      "question": "Is the entire scene set on a smooth, light-colored wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The original arrangement of the wings and dipping container should be preserved in terms of layout and relative positioning, even though the objects themselves are transformed. The plush wings should still be arranged similarly to the original, and the pillow should be placed where the sauce was.",
      "question": "Are the plush wings and the orange pillow arranged in the same spatial configuration as the original chicken wings and sauce?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The transformation must make the objects clearly identifiable as plush toys rather than real food. This includes visible fabric texture, stitching, soft shadows, and lack of realistic food features like grease, char marks, or liquid consistency.",
      "question": "Do the plush wings and pillow clearly appear as fabric-based toys rather than real food items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
