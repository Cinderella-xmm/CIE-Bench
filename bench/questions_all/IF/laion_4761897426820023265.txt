Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating a miniature 3D model of the Great Wall and surrounding mountains. This implies a scaled-down, three-dimensional representation that maintains recognizable structural features such as the wall’s winding path and mountain contours. The model should not be life-size or realistic but stylized and reduced in scale.
Question: Is the Great Wall and surrounding mountains rendered as a miniature 3D model rather than a full-scale photograph?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires encasing the entire scene in a crystal-clear snow globe. This means the model must be fully enclosed within a transparent spherical container, visible from the outside, with reflections or refractions consistent with glass or acrylic material.
Question: Is the miniature model of the Great Wall and mountains enclosed within a transparent, spherical snow globe?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for tiny, detailed figures walking the Wall. These figures must be significantly smaller than the original human scale and still show discernible clothing, posture, or movement details to qualify as “detailed.”
Question: Are there small-scale human figures depicted walking along the Great Wall inside the snow globe, with visible details such as clothing or accessories?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Bright autumn foliage is explicitly mentioned. This refers to trees or vegetation showing vibrant fall colors such as red, orange, yellow, or gold, which should contrast with greenery and enhance the seasonal theme.
Question: Are areas of the landscape inside the snow globe adorned with bright autumn-colored foliage (e.g., red, orange, yellow leaves)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A swirling snow effect is required, implying motion-like visual elements such as falling white particles in spiral or random patterns, simulating snowfall within the enclosed globe.
Question: Is there a visible swirling snow effect inside the snow globe, with tiny white particles appearing to float or fall?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Tiny ceramic birds in flight are specified. These should be small, stylized bird figures made of ceramic material, positioned mid-flight within the globe, adding narrative charm.
Question: Are there small, ceramic-looking birds depicted in flight inside the snow globe?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The snow globe must rest on a dark wooden base, which serves as a foundation. The base should have a rich brown or black wood texture and appear solid and stable.
Question: Is the snow globe placed on a dark wooden base?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: The base must be engraved with the text "Great Wall Memories." This requires legible, carved lettering on the surface of the base, clearly readable from the viewer's perspective.
Question: Is the phrase "Great Wall Memories" visibly engraved on the wooden base?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
