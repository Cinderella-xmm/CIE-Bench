Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the skater into a futuristic cyberpunk athlete. This implies replacing casual clothing with advanced, high-tech attire. Cyberpunk aesthetics typically include metallic surfaces, glowing elements, and a fusion of organic and mechanical features. The character should no longer appear in everyday streetwear.
Question: Has the skater been replaced with a figure wearing sleek metallic armor and neon accents instead of a red hoodie and jeans?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The skateboard must be transformed into a hoverboard with a glowing, transparent deck. This involves removing physical wheels and replacing them with a levitating platform that emits light and has a see-through or translucent surface, consistent with futuristic technology.
Question: Is the skateboard now a hoverboard with a glowing, transparent deck and no visible wheels?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The background skate park must be converted into a neon-lit urban landscape. This includes replacing natural lighting with artificial neon lights, adding city structures like tall buildings or digital billboards, and changing the overall atmosphere to reflect a dystopian or high-tech urban setting.
Question: Has the skate park been replaced with a neon-lit urban environment featuring digital structures and artificial lighting?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Digital graffiti animations imply that the graffiti on walls is not static but moving or pulsing with light, possibly incorporating holographic effects or animated text. This is a key element of cyberpunk visual culture.
Question: Are the graffiti elements in the scene animated or displaying digital, glowing, or interactive effects?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The style must reflect a vibrant, otherworldly illustration with dynamic motion lines. This means the image should have exaggerated motion streaks, bright contrasting colors, and an overall surreal or stylized look typical of sci-fi art.
Question: Does the image feature dynamic motion lines around the skater to emphasize movement and speed?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Although the style changes, the core action—the skater mid-trick—must be preserved. The posture, balance, and position in the air should remain consistent with the original image to maintain continuity of the action.
Question: Has the skater maintained the same mid-air pose and orientation as in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
