Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the creation of a branded packaging titled "Jungle Friends Adventure." This implies visible text on the image indicating the brand name in a prominent and readable manner, likely integrated into the scene or displayed on a box or label.
Question: Is the text "Jungle Friends Adventure" clearly visible somewhere in the image, such as on packaging or a sign?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The room must be transformed into an illustrated jungle scene. This involves changing the environment from a typical bedroom to one that resembles a jungle, including elements like trees, vines, or a dense natural setting, while maintaining the original layout.
Question: Has the background of the room been visually transformed to resemble a jungle scene with elements such as trees, vines, or dense vegetation?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The plush giraffe is specified as the centerpiece. This means it should be positioned prominently in the foreground, larger than other objects, and possibly elevated or highlighted compared to surrounding toys.
Question: Is the plush giraffe positioned centrally and prominently in the foreground, appearing larger and more dominant than other toys?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Vibrant green foliage motifs must be added around the giraffe. These are decorative plant-like elements (e.g., leaves, ferns) in bright green colors placed near or around the giraffe to enhance the jungle theme.
Question: Are there bright green leafy or plant-like motifs visibly surrounding the giraffe?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Animal footprints must be incorporated along the floor. These should be distinct, stylized traces resembling animal paws or hooves, placed along the floor surface to suggest movement through a jungle.
Question: Are there visible animal footprints, such as paw prints or hoof marks, drawn or placed along the floor of the room?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Playful, colorful typography must be used on the walls. This refers to letters or words written in fun, whimsical fonts with bright colors, possibly forming phrases or names related to the jungle theme.
Question: Are there colorful, playful letters or words visible on the walls using non-standard, cartoonish fonts?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: Plush toys must be wrapped in clear packaging. This means each toy should be enclosed in transparent material like cellophane or plastic wrap, allowing visibility of the toy inside.
Question: Are all the plush toys in the image enclosed in transparent packaging, such as clear plastic or cellophane?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: Branded tags with playful, jungle-themed designs must be attached to the packaging. These tags should feature illustrations or patterns related to jungle animals, plants, or adventure themes and include branding elements.

Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
