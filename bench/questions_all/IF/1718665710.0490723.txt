Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the character into a "stylized keychain" with a "chibi medieval knight appearance". This implies a significant change in scale and style, including exaggerated proportions typical of chibi art (e.g., large head, small body), simplified features, and a miniature form suitable for a keychain. The original image is a full-sized realistic portrait, so the edited version must clearly depict a small, cartoonish figure resembling a knight on a keychain.
Question: Is the character depicted as a small, stylized chibi figure suitable for a keychain?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the armor to have "glossy enamel colors" and "thick black outlines", which are hallmarks of a cartoon or anime-style illustration. These elements must be visually distinct—shiny, colorful surfaces with bold outlines—to match the described stylization.
Question: Does the armor feature glossy enamel-like colors with visible reflections and thick black outlines?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states that the head should be "oversized" while still preserving the detail of the curly hair. This means the head must occupy a disproportionately large portion of the figure compared to the body, but the curls and texture of the hair must remain recognizable.
Question: Is the character's head significantly larger than the body, while still showing detailed curly hair?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the character should be "attached to a small silver chain", indicating a physical connection between the chibi figure and a metallic chain, likely extending from the top of the figure or its back. This is a functional element of a keychain.
Question: Is a small silver chain visibly attached to the character, suggesting it is a keychain?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The background must be changed to a "simple dark velvet background" to create contrast and emphasize elegance and whimsy. Velvet implies a soft, textured surface, and "dark" suggests deep tones like black or navy. The background should not contain architectural details or complex elements seen in the original image.
Question: Is the background a plain, dark, velvet-textured surface without any architectural elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
