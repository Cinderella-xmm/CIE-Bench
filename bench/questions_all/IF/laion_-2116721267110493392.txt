Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly requires the creation of a storybook cover titled "A Classroom Adventure". This means the final image must include a clear title at the top of the composition. The title must be present and readable.
Question: Is the title "A Classroom Adventure" displayed at the top of the image in a bold, cheerful font?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies two cartoon boys—one with curly hair and one bald. These characters must be stylized as cartoons and clearly distinguishable by their hair features. In the original image, both boys are present, but they are real children; the edit must transform them into cartoon versions matching the description.
Question: Are the two boys depicted as cartoon characters, with one having curly hair and the other bald?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the boys to be sitting excitedly in a whimsical classroom setting. Their posture and facial expressions must convey excitement, and the environment must appear fantastical or imaginative rather than realistic.
Question: Do the two cartoon boys appear to be sitting in an excited posture within a whimsical classroom environment?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction mandates the use of vibrant colors—specifically bright cyan and lemon yellow—for the furniture. These colors must be clearly visible on tables, chairs, or other classroom furnishings.

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies adding friendly robots and fun gadgets hovering around the scene. These elements must be illustrated in a cartoon style and positioned in the air or space around the characters to emphasize interactivity and playfulness.
Question: Are there friendly-looking robots and fun gadgets illustrated and hovering around the characters?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the overall image to feel youthful, interactive, and engaging. This can be assessed by checking if the visual style uses exaggerated features, bright colors, motion lines, or glowing effects typical of children’s storybooks.
