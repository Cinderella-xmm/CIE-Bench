      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the entire beach scene into an Art Deco travel poster style. This implies a shift from realistic depiction to stylized, graphic representation with strong lines, symmetry, and decorative elements typical of Art Deco. Key indicators include flat colors, sharp outlines, and a lack of photorealistic textures.",
      "question": "Is the image rendered in a stylized, graphic manner consistent with Art Deco design principles, rather than a photorealistic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The waves must be depicted using bold geometric curves, which is a hallmark of Art Deco design. This means the natural wave forms should be simplified into angular or flowing curved shapes, not realistic splashes or foam.",
      "question": "Are the ocean waves represented using bold, simplified geometric curves instead of naturalistic wave forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Palm trees are explicitly instructed to be stylized as vertical lines. This means they should no longer resemble realistic trees but instead appear as abstract, linear forms—likely straight or slightly tapered lines with minimal detail.",
      "question": "Are the palm trees depicted as stylized vertical lines without detailed fronds or natural tree structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The clouds must be transformed into symmetrical shapes, indicating a departure from natural cloud formations. Symmetry suggests mirrored or balanced patterns, possibly resembling fan shapes, chevrons, or other geometric motifs common in Art Deco.",
      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky rendered as symmetrical, geometric shapes rather than natural cloud forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The color palette must consist of muted greens, blues, and warm oranges. This means bright or saturated colors should be avoided in favor of earthy tones. The image should not feature vibrant yellows, reds, or whites that would break the earthy tone.",
      "question": "Does the image use a color palette dominated by muted greens, blues, and warm oranges, avoiding bright or highly saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The original beach scene includes sand, water, horizon, and sky. The edit must preserve these elements but transform them into Art Deco style. Therefore, while stylized, the core components of the beach (shoreline, waves, sky) must still be recognizable.",
      "question": "Are the essential elements of the beach scene—sand, ocean, horizon, and sky—still present and recognizable despite the stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
