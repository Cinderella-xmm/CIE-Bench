```
- Add a zen-inspired diagram illustrating “The Journey of Tea” around the existing tea set
- Maintain the original table setting (teapot, cup, chopsticks, vase with blossoms, mats)
- Include annotated lines with minimalist icons representing each step:
  1) Tea leaves harvested
  2) Boiling water poured
  3) Sipping for mindfulness
  4) Blossoms symbolize tranquility
- Use handwritten calligraphy for captioning
- Integrate soft pastel green hues to complement the serene beige and cherry blossom setting
- Ensure diagrams flow harmoniously around existing elements without obstructing or distorting them

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires adding a zen-inspired diagram illustrating "The Journey of Tea." This implies a visual flow with annotations and icons that represent four distinct steps. The presence of such a diagram must be objectively verifiable by identifying lines, icons, and captions that map to the specified stages.
Question: Is there a diagram composed of annotated lines and minimalist icons surrounding the tea set, illustrating the four steps of "The Journey of Tea"?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies four distinct steps in the journey: harvesting tea leaves, pouring boiling water, sipping for mindfulness, and blossoms symbolizing tranquility. Each step must be represented by a unique minimalist icon and connected via lines to form a coherent flow.
Question: Are there four distinct minimalist icons visible in the image, each corresponding to one of the following: tea leaves harvested, boiling water poured, sipping for mindfulness, and blossoms symbolizing tranquility?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction mandates handwritten calligraphy for captioning the diagram. This refers to text that appears in a natural, non-digital script style, likely in soft pastel green, which should be legible and integrated into the design.
Question: Are the labels or captions accompanying the diagram written in a handwritten calligraphy style?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies the use of soft pastel green hues to complement the existing color palette of beige and cherry blossoms. This means that at least some elements—such as lines, text, or icons—should incorporate this color tone visibly.
Question: Are soft pastel green hues present in the diagram elements (e.g., lines, icons, or text) to complement the overall color scheme?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction requires maintaining the original table setting, including the teapot, cup, chopsticks, vase with blossoms, and mats. These elements must remain intact and unaltered in position and appearance.
Question: Are all original objects—the teapot, cup, chopsticks, vase with cherry blossoms, and patterned mats—present and unchanged in their positions and appearances?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction states that the diagram must flow harmoniously around existing elements, meaning it should not overlap or obscure key objects like the teapot or cup, and should integrate aesthetically into the scene.
Question: Does the added diagram avoid overlapping or obscuring any of the original table elements and instead flow naturally around them?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
