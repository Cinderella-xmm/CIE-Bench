      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the sports-themed bedspread into a LEGO block quilt. This implies replacing the fabric pattern with interlocking LEGO-like blocks, using colors that match the original design but in a modular, brick-based format. The key is whether the quilt now consists of visible rectangular or square LEGO-style tiles arranged in a patchwork fashion.",
      "question": "Is the bedspread composed of multicolored LEGO-style blocks arranged in a patchwork pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that balls (football, basketball, soccer ball, baseball) should be mimicked using round tile pieces. This means each sports ball must be represented not as a realistic image, but as a circular arrangement of LEGO tiles, possibly with color patterns matching the original ball (e.g., black and white for soccer).",
      "question": "Are the sports balls on the quilt represented by circular arrangements of LEGO-style tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The pillow must be replaced with a cube made of stacked LEGO bricks. This involves changing the shape from a soft cushion to a rigid, cubic structure built from identifiable LEGO bricks, likely with visible studs and layered construction.",
      "question": "Has the pillow been replaced with a cube-shaped object constructed from stacked LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The bed must be placed on a plain white LEGO baseplate. This means the bed frame and mattress should appear to rest on a flat, white surface resembling a LEGO baseplate, which typically has a grid pattern of raised studs.",
      "question": "Is the bed resting on a plain white surface with a visible LEGO baseplate texture (grid of raised studs)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The background must be changed to a smooth white surface to create a clean, playful, and tactile visual effect. This eliminates any wall, window, or furniture from the original room setting and replaces it with a uniform white backdrop.",
      "question": "Is the entire background of the image a smooth, uninterrupted white surface with no visible walls, windows, or furniture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction implies that the entire scene should be stylized consistently in LEGO form, including the bed structure and any visible elements like the nightstand or floor. However, since only the bed and quilt are specified, the focus is on ensuring that the bed itself appears to be made of LEGO components or at least sits on a LEGO baseplate.",
      "question": "Does the bed frame or mattress appear to be constructed from LEGO bricks or styled to resemble LEGO material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "No (unless explicitly stated; default assumption is only the baseplate is LEGO)",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of the soccer ball on the rug and other non-bed elements in the original image must be removed or transformed to fit the LEGO theme. Since the instruction focuses on the bed setup, these items should not be present in the final image unless reimagined as LEGO versions.",
      "question": "Are there any non-LEGO objects such as a real soccer ball, lamp, or framed picture present in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
