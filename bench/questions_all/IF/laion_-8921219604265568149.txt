Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire scene into a miniature. This means the scale of all elements (cathedral, square, people) must be reduced to appear like a model or diorama. The key observable feature is whether the objects are proportionally smaller and appear to be part of a contained, scaled-down representation.
Question: Is the cathedral and surrounding square depicted at a significantly reduced scale, consistent with a miniature model?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The scene must be encased in an ornate, baroque-style display case. Baroque style typically includes elaborate ornamentation, curved forms, scrollwork, and rich detailing. The presence of such a frame around the miniature is essential.
Question: Is the entire scene enclosed within an ornate, decorative frame featuring baroque-style architectural details such as scrolls, columns, or intricate carvings?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies adding tiny, elaborately dressed figures strolling the square. These figures must be visibly smaller than life-size and wearing detailed, period-appropriate clothing to reflect historical theme.
Question: Are there small-scale human figures present in the square, wearing detailed historical or formal attire, and positioned as if walking or strolling?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The cathedral façade must be rendered in warm beige resin. This implies a uniform, slightly textured surface with a warm tone (e.g., light tan or honey beige), distinct from natural stone, and resembling synthetic resin material.
Question: Is the cathedral façade uniformly colored in a warm beige tone and visually textured to resemble resin rather than natural stone?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Miniature lamps with a dim, antique-style glow must be added. These should appear small in scale, have vintage designs (e.g., gas-lamp or lantern style), and emit soft, warm lighting that suggests antiquity.
Question: Are there small, vintage-style lamps placed around the scene emitting a soft, dim, warm glow consistent with antique lighting?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: An engraved plaque with the cathedral's name and history must be visible on the display case. It should be legible and stylistically consistent with historical commemoration—possibly metallic or stone-like with inscribed text.
Question: Is there a visible engraved plaque on the display case containing text identifying the cathedral and its history?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The background behind the miniature must be a painted vignette of a vibrant sky. This means the backdrop should not be real sky but an artistic rendering showing dynamic colors (e.g., sunset hues, clouds) with a soft edge or fade typical of a vignette.
Question: Is the background of the scene a painted depiction of a vibrant sky, with visible color gradients and cloud formations, framed by a soft vignette effect?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
