Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires anthropomorphizing the handbag into a human model. This means the bag must be transformed into a full-bodied figure resembling a woman, with limbs, posture, and facial features, while retaining visual cues from the bag’s design. The transformation should not just be symbolic but visually integrated.
Question: Has the black handbag been transformed into a human-like female model with a defined body, posture, and facial features?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The dress worn by the model must visually echo the bag’s leather texture and shape. This implies that the fabric of the dress should have a similar pebbled texture and silhouette that mirrors the contours of the original handbag.
Question: Does the model wear a black dress that replicates the pebbled leather texture and curved silhouette of the original handbag?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The accessories must include gold jewelry that reflects the bag’s hardware—such as gold zippers, buckles, and clasps. These elements should be translated into wearable items like earrings, bracelets, or necklaces made of gold material.
Question: Is the model wearing gold jewelry (e.g., earrings, necklace, bracelet) that matches the gold hardware of the original handbag?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The MK logo must appear as a brooch on the model’s clothing. It should be positioned prominently, likely on the chest or lapel area, and styled as a decorative accessory consistent with high-fashion jewelry.
Question: Is the MK logo displayed as a circular gold brooch attached to the model’s dress or jacket?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The text "Strut the City Streets" must be present in a serif font, which is typically characterized by small lines or strokes attached to the ends of larger strokes in letters. The font should be stylish and legible, placed appropriately within the poster.
Question: Is the text "Strut the City Streets" displayed in a stylish serif font somewhere on the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The background must depict a luxurious fashion runway with celebrity photographers. This includes visible elements such as a glossy runway surface, bright stage lighting, and figures holding cameras, possibly blurred to suggest depth and movement.
Question: Does the background feature a luxury fashion runway with at least one visible photographer holding a camera?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The aspect ratio must be tall and narrow to convey elegance. This corresponds to a vertical orientation where height significantly exceeds width (e.g., 3:1 or 4:1), typical of magazine-style fashion posters.
Question: Is the image formatted in a tall, narrow aspect ratio (height much greater than width)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
