      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the motorcycle into a LEGO model using black and blue bricks. This implies that the entire body of the motorcycle must be constructed from visible brick-like elements, with a color scheme limited to black and blue, resembling LEGO construction blocks.",
      "question": "Is the motorcycle composed entirely of black and blue LEGO-style bricks?",

      "thinking_process": "The original motorcycle has an angular design; this must be preserved in the LEGO version. The transformation should not soften or round edges but maintain sharp angles and geometric shapes consistent with the original form.",
      "question": "Does the LEGO model retain the angular design features of the original motorcycle?",

      "thinking_process": "Colorful decals must be used as printed tile elements. This means that the decorative graphics (such as logos, stripes, or characters) should appear as if they are printed onto LEGO tiles, maintaining their colors and placement while fitting the blocky aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The original stripe dynamics—referring to the flow and pattern of the blue and black stripes on the motorcycle—must be preserved in the LEGO version. This means the arrangement and visual rhythm of the stripes should remain recognizable even in brick form.",
      "question": "Do the blue and black stripes follow the same dynamic flow and positioning as in the original image?",
