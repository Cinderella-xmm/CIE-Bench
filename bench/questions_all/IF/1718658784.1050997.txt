- Stylize the cake with bold, graphic icing patterns (e.g., geometric shapes, high-contrast lines, or repetitive motifs)
- Render the balloons in vivid monochrome dots (i.e., each balloon composed of uniform colored dots, not solid colors)
- Convert the table and vase into contrasting color blocks (i.e., simplified flat colors without texture or gradient)
- Emphasize the candle flame with exaggerated sharp lines and bright hues (e.g., jagged edges, neon-like glow, intense color saturation)
- Maintain the overall composition and key elements (cake, candle, balloons, vase, table) in their original positions and proportions
- Ensure all visual elements conform to a vibrant pop art style (characterized by high contrast, flat areas of color, bold outlines, and stylized forms)

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the cake to be stylized with bold, graphic icing patterns. This implies replacing realistic frosting textures with simplified, high-contrast designs such as repeating shapes, stripes, or polka dots typical of pop art. The current cake has textured pink frosting resembling beads—this must be replaced with graphic patterns.
Question: Does the cake feature bold, graphic icing patterns such as geometric shapes, stripes, or repetitive motifs instead of realistic frosting?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The balloons must be rendered in vivid monochrome dots, meaning they should not appear as solid-colored spheres but rather as fields of uniformly spaced, colored dots (like halftone patterns). This is a core pop art technique used to simulate color through dot density.
Question: Are the balloons composed of vivid monochrome dots rather than solid colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The table and vase must be converted into contrasting color blocks, meaning any texture, shading, or detail should be removed and replaced with flat, solid colors that stand out from each other and the background. This aligns with pop art’s use of flat planes of color.
Question: Is the table rendered as a flat, solid color block without texture or gradient?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The vase must also be transformed into a flat color block, losing its original ceramic texture and pattern. It should appear as a simple shape filled with a single, contrasting color.
Question: Is the vase depicted as a solid color block without visible texture or design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The candle flame must be emphasized with exaggerated sharp lines and bright hues, suggesting a stylized, almost electric appearance with angular contours and intense coloration (e.g., bright yellow, orange, or red with sharp edges).
Question: Does the candle flame have exaggerated sharp lines and bright, saturated colors instead of a natural, soft glow?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The overall image must reflect a vibrant pop art style, which includes high contrast, flat colors, bold outlines, and stylized forms. This means all elements should adhere to this aesthetic, not just individual components.
Question: Does the entire image exhibit characteristics of pop art, including flat colors, bold outlines, and stylized forms across all elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
