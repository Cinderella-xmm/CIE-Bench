Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the horse into a chibi-style plush toy. Chibi style is characterized by a disproportionately large head relative to the body, simplified features, and a cute, cartoonish appearance. This requires evaluating whether the horse’s proportions have been altered to match this style.
Question: Is the horse's head significantly larger than its body, consistent with chibi-style proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for an exaggerated, fluffy mane. This implies the mane should be voluminous, flowing, and stylized beyond natural proportions, especially in a plush toy context where texture and fluffiness are emphasized.
Question: Does the horse have an unusually large, fluffy, and exaggerated mane that appears soft and plush-like?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The material is specified as soft brown fabric with white patches. This means the horse’s body should visually resemble textile material (e.g., stitched or textured surface), not realistic fur, and include distinct white areas on a brown base.
Question: Is the horse’s body made of a fabric-like material with visible brown and white patches, resembling soft textile?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Embroidered eyes and a friendly smile are key features of a plush toy. These should be clearly visible and stylized—such as simple stitched lines for the mouth and eyes with no realistic detail.
Question: Are the horse’s eyes and mouth stylized as embroidered features, such as stitched lines or dots, forming a friendly expression?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The legs should be short and stubby to enhance cuteness, which is a hallmark of chibi design. This involves assessing limb proportion—shorter than natural horse legs, possibly with rounded ends.
Question: Are the horse’s legs noticeably short and stubby compared to its body size, contributing to a cute, toy-like appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The scene must include a field of felt dandelions. Felt suggests a flat, textured, artificial material, not real flowers. The dandelions should be uniformly shaped and placed across the foreground.
Question: Are the dandelions in the foreground made of a felt-like material with uniform, round seed heads and thin stems?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The setting must be a boxed diorama with a forest backdrop. A diorama implies a contained, framed environment with depth, often with visible edges or boundaries, and a background depicting a forest scene.
Question: Is the scene enclosed within a visible box or frame, with a forest scene depicted in the background?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
