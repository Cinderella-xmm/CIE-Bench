Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the horse into a 3D puzzle piece. This means the horse must no longer be a solid object but instead appear segmented into interlocking puzzle-like parts, maintaining its overall shape and floral design. The transformation should be visually evident through visible seams or edges between puzzle sections.
Question: Is the horse visibly composed of distinct 3D puzzle pieces with defined edges separating each section?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The display case must be rustic-themed, implying materials like wood and a handcrafted appearance. It should fully enclose the horse puzzle piece, suggesting a frame or cabinet structure. The presence of a glass dome implies transparent covering over the top.
Question: Is the horse enclosed within a wooden-framed display case that has a transparent glass dome covering it?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The base of the display case must have a textured wooden surface, indicating visible grain, roughness, or carved details consistent with rustic aesthetics. It should serve as a foundation for the entire setup.
Question: Does the display case rest on a textured wooden base that shows natural wood grain or carving details?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The floral motifs from the original horse must be preserved but broken into separate puzzle sections. Each segment of the horse should show part of the original floral pattern, with the design split across multiple pieces.
Question: Are the intricate floral patterns on the horse fragmented across individual puzzle sections, with no single piece showing a complete motif?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A vintage compass must be added to the base as a decorative element. It should resemble an antique-style compass with brass or aged metal appearance, fitting the rustic and antique-brass accent theme.
Question: Is there a vintage-style compass embedded or placed on the wooden base of the display case?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Subtle antique-brass accents are required to complement the log cabin aesthetic. These could include small fittings, hinges, trim, or hardware on the display case or base, with a warm, aged metallic finish.
Question: Are there visible antique-brass colored accents such as hinges, trim, or fixtures on the display case or base?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
