Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the entire scene (knight and castle) must be transformed into a miniaturized diorama enclosed within a glass dome. This implies the presence of a transparent spherical or hemispherical enclosure surrounding the elements, visible as a boundary with reflections or refractions typical of glass.
Question: Is the knight and castle contained within a transparent glass dome?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The knight must be converted into a chibi-style 3D figure, which refers to a stylized character with an oversized head relative to the body, exaggerated proportions, and simplified features typical of anime or cartoon aesthetics. This transformation is distinct from realistic armor design.
Question: Has the knight been transformed into a chibi-style figure with exaggerated proportions (e.g., large head, small body)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The knight must be holding a polished metal shield, indicating a reflective surface and metallic material. The shield should be clearly visible in the knight’s hand and consistent with the description of being "polished."
Question: Is the knight holding a shield made of polished metal with visible reflections?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction requires earthy and muted tones to evoke a medieval atmosphere. This means the color palette should include browns, grays, ochres, and soft greens—avoiding bright or saturated colors. The overall lighting and textures should reflect a subdued, historical aesthetic.
Question: Are the dominant colors in the image earthy and muted (e.g., browns, grays, soft greens), consistent with a medieval atmosphere?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states that tiny flocks of sheep should be grazing around the knight. These must be present, small in scale compared to the knight, and engaged in grazing behavior (e.g., heads down, positioned on grass).
Question: Are there small groups of sheep visible grazing near the knight?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A sleeping dragon curled around a turret is required to enhance the whimsical narrative. The dragon must be depicted in a resting pose, coiled around one of the castle’s turrets, and proportionally smaller than the structure but still clearly identifiable.
Question: Is there a dragon visible, curled around a turret, and appearing to be asleep?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The scene must convey a whimsical narrative within the confined space of the dome. This implies a sense of fantasy, playfulness, and intentional composition where elements like the sleeping dragon and grazing sheep contribute to a story-like quality rather than realism.
Question: Does the overall scene within the dome suggest a whimsical, imaginative narrative (e.g., peaceful coexistence of knight, dragon, and animals)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
