Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies converting the scene into a vintage art print series on satin paper. This implies a transformation in medium and surface texture—specifically, the image should appear as if printed on satin paper with a soft sheen and subtle reflective qualities typical of such material. Vintage art prints also suggest aged tones, possibly sepia or muted color palettes, and a slightly textured or grainy surface.
Question: Does the edited image display a visual texture consistent with satin paper, including a soft sheen and slight reflectivity?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The suit must be stylized using watercolor blue-black tones. Watercolor implies translucent, blended edges, visible brushstrokes, and soft transitions between colors, especially in the dark blue to black range. This is distinct from solid digital rendering.
Question: Is the suit rendered with visible watercolor effects, showing blended blue-black hues and soft, painterly edges?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Golden pinstripe details must be added to the suit. These are fine, parallel lines in gold that run vertically along the suit fabric, suggesting luxury and classic elegance. They must be clearly visible and integrated into the watercolor style without clashing.
Question: Are there visible golden pinstripes running vertically along the suit jacket, consistent with the watercolor aesthetic?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The tie must feature various patterns, implying that the final output includes multiple versions of the image where the tie pattern changes (e.g., polka dots, stripes, floral). Since this is a series, at least two different tie patterns should be present across the set.
Question: Are there at least two different tie patterns visible across the images in the series?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Each card must be part of a leather-bound album with an embossed title. This requires the presence of a physical-looking album cover with a raised, tactile title, likely in gold or metallic lettering. The image should convey depth, texture, and craftsmanship associated with leather binding.
Question: Is the image presented within a leather-bound album frame featuring an embossed title, with visible texture and depth suggesting real leather and raised lettering?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The overall aesthetic must emphasize texture and classic elegance. This means the image should include rich textures (e.g., satin, leather, brushed metal), balanced composition, refined color choices, and a sense of timeless design. Classic elegance also implies symmetry, restraint, and high-quality materials.
Question: Does the edited image exhibit rich textures (such as satin, leather, or watercolor brushwork) and a refined, timeless composition that conveys classic elegance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
