Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the horse sculpture to be encased in a transparent showcase box. This implies the presence of a clear enclosure that fully surrounds the sculpture while allowing full visibility. The transparency must be sufficient to see the entire sculpture without obstruction.
Question: Is the horse sculpture enclosed in a transparent box that allows full visibility of its form?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Gold accents are explicitly mentioned as part of the showcase box design. These should be visually distinct metallic elements—such as trim, edges, or decorative details—on the box structure, not just coloration or reflection.
Question: Are there visible gold-colored decorative elements or trim on the transparent showcase box?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: A modern, elegant brand logo must be placed on the black base stand. This means the logo should be clearly positioned on the base, not floating or misplaced, and should reflect a clean, contemporary design aesthetic (e.g., minimalist typography, sleek lines).
Question: Is a modern and elegantly designed brand logo visible on the black base stand beneath the showcase box?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies a luxurious, textured backdrop pattern inspired by ancient Chinese motifs inside the box. This means the interior background behind the sculpture should feature an ornate, culturally relevant pattern such as cloud motifs, dragon patterns, or traditional lattice designs with texture.
Question: Is there a textured backdrop inside the showcase box featuring a pattern inspired by ancient Chinese art or motifs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The box must have a magnetic closure, which implies a lid or cover that attaches seamlessly to the base via magnetic force. While not always visibly detectable, the presence of a smooth seam, lack of hinges, and a flush closure suggest a magnetic mechanism intended for premium unboxing.
Question: Does the showcase box have a seamless, flush closure suggesting a magnetic mechanism rather than a hinge or latch?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The original horse sculpture must remain intact and clearly visible. Any editing should preserve its shape, color, and position relative to the original image. It should not be obscured, distorted, or altered in form.
Question: Is the original horse sculpture fully preserved and clearly visible through the transparent box without distortion or occlusion?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
