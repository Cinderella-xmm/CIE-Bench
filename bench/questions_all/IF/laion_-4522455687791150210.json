      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the woman into a Renaissance-inspired marble statue. This requires evaluating whether the human figure has been converted into a stone-like, sculptural form consistent with Renaissance art—characterized by smooth, polished surfaces, idealized anatomy, and classical proportions. The material should resemble marble, not cloth or flesh.",
      "question": "Is the woman depicted as a marble statue rather than a living person?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The saree must be sculpted with intricate folds and flowing lines to convey movement, even though it is now part of a statue. This means the drapery should appear dynamic and realistically rendered in marble, with depth, shadow, and creases suggesting motion.",
      "question": "Are the folds of the saree intricately detailed and rendered to suggest movement and flow?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The fabric details of the saree must be rendered in marble texture, meaning the entire drape should appear carved from stone, not fabric. This includes the pattern, border, and pallu—all transformed into stone relief.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The jewelry must remain as engraved accents, meaning they are no longer three-dimensional or metallic but instead appear etched or incised into the marble surface, consistent with stone carving techniques.",
      "question": "Are the necklace and earrings represented as engraved or incised details on the marble surface?",
