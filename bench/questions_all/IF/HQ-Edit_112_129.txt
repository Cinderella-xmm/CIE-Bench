- Transform the ornate teapot into an enchanting miniature scene within a glass dome display
- Position the teapot on a vintage wooden base with a soft, velvet lining
- Add tiny flowering plants and ferns emerging from the spout and lid
- Create delicate, small butterflies hovering around the floral engravings
- Use subtle, earth-toned hues for a sophisticated, immersive look
- Maintain the original ornate design of the teapot while integrating new elements
- Ensure the glass dome is visible and encloses the entire scene

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the teapot into a miniature scene inside a glass dome. This implies that the teapot must be enclosed in a transparent, spherical or domed structure that visually separates it from the surrounding environment. The presence of a glass dome is a critical structural element that defines the transformation.
Question: Is the teapot enclosed within a transparent glass dome?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The teapot must be placed on a vintage wooden base with a soft velvet lining. This specifies both material (wood) and texture (velvet), which should be visually distinguishable. The base must appear aged or antique, and the velvet should show softness and contrast with the wood.
Question: Is the teapot positioned on a vintage-style wooden base with a visible soft velvet lining underneath?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Tiny flowering plants and ferns are required to emerge from the spout and lid. These should be clearly visible as small-scale botanical elements growing out of those specific areas, indicating intentional integration into the teapot's structure.
Question: Are there tiny flowering plants and ferns visibly growing from the spout and lid of the teapot?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Delicate, small butterflies must hover around the floral engravings. These butterflies should be proportionally small compared to the teapot, positioned near the engraved flowers, and rendered in a way that suggests movement or suspension in air.
Question: Are there small butterflies visible, hovering near the floral engravings on the teapot?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The color palette must use subtle, earth-toned hues (such as browns, greens, soft grays, muted golds) to create a sophisticated and immersive atmosphere. The overall image should not feature bright or unnatural colors, especially not metallic silver or high-contrast tones.
Question: Does the image use primarily subtle earth-toned colors (e.g., browns, greens, soft grays) throughout the scene, avoiding bright or metallic highlights?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The original ornate design of the teapot must be preserved, meaning its detailed floral engravings and sculptural features should remain intact and recognizable despite the addition of new elements like plants and butterflies.
Question: Are the original ornate floral engravings and decorative details of the teapot still clearly visible and preserved?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The glass dome must fully enclose the teapot and all added elements (plants, butterflies, base), forming a complete sealed display. Any gaps or missing enclosure would violate the "display" aspect of the instruction.
Question: Does the glass dome completely enclose the teapot, base, plants, and butterflies without any visible openings?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
