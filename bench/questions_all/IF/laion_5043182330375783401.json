      "question": "Is the overall composition stylized with strong geometric lines, symmetry, and decorative elements typical of Art Deco design?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "While the style is being changed, the figure’s posture and identity must remain recognizable—especially the seated position, arms crossed, and facial features like the mustache and closed eyes. This ensures the transformation respects the original subject while applying new stylistic rules.",
      "question": "Has the figure maintained its original seated pose with arms crossed and facial features (such as the mustache and closed eyes) clearly visible?",
