Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires replacing the original wooden material with transparent blue and teal crystals. This involves a complete material transformation from wood to crystal, including color shift and translucency. The key observable feature is whether the surface now appears glassy, translucent, and colored in shades of blue and teal.
Question: Has the wooden material been replaced with transparent blue and teal crystalline material?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the facets and angles of the crystal must reflect the fish's scales and curves. This means the crystal should have geometric cuts and edges that follow the contours of the fishâ€™s body, especially along the fins, tail, and scale patterns. These features must be visible as angular or faceted surfaces rather than smooth wood grain.
Question: Do the facets and angles of the sculpture accurately represent the fish's scales and curved body structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The requirement for "glossy textures to mimic water-like fluidity" implies the surface must have high reflectivity, smoothness, and possibly light refraction effects similar to water or glass. This includes visible highlights, internal reflections, and a wet or shiny appearance.
Question: Does the sculpture exhibit glossy, reflective surfaces that suggest water-like fluidity?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The setting must be changed to a minimalist white gallery space. This implies a clean, uncluttered environment with neutral white walls, floor, and ceiling, devoid of distracting elements such as furniture or decorations. The lighting should be even and soft, typical of art galleries.
Question: Is the sculpture presented in a minimalist white gallery space with no visible distractions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The sculpture must be placed on a sleek, mirrored pedestal. This means the base should be flat, modern in design, highly reflective (like polished metal or mirror), and positioned to enhance visibility of the sculpture through reflections. The reflection should clearly show parts of the crystal sculpture.
Question: Is the sculpture mounted on a sleek, mirrored pedestal that reflects its image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
