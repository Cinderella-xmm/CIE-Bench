-Replace the diffuse, smoky brown background with an expansive, aged blackboard.
-Cover the blackboard with chalk-written equations of relativity and swirling galactic sketches.
-Maintain the soft, warm illumination on both Albert Einstein and the pineapple.
-Ensure the aged appearance of the blackboard.
-Keep the positions and appearances of Albert Einstein and the pineapple unchanged.

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies replacing the existing background with an aged blackboard. The question should focus on whether this replacement has occurred.
Question: Has the diffuse, smoky brown background been replaced with an expansive blackboard?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The blackboard needs to be covered with specific contentâ€”equations of relativity and galactic sketches. The question should verify the presence of these elements.
Question: Is the blackboard intricately covered with chalk-written equations of relativity and swirling galactic sketches?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction emphasizes maintaining the soft, warm illumination on both subjects. The question should check if the lighting conditions remain consistent.
Question: Does the soft, warm illumination on both Albert Einstein and the pineapple remain consistent after the background change?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The blackboard should appear aged as per the instruction. The question should confirm the aged look of the blackboard.
Question: Does the blackboard exhibit an aged appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The positions and appearances of Albert Einstein and the pineapple should remain unchanged. The question should ensure that these elements have not been altered.
Question: Have the positions and appearances of Albert Einstein and the pineapple remained unchanged?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
