Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the entire scene to be enclosed within a glass snow globe. This implies the presence of a transparent spherical boundary around the figurines, visible as a curved surface with reflections or refractions typical of glass. The figurines must no longer appear isolated against a plain background but instead be contained within this globe.
Question: Is the scene enclosed within a transparent glass snow globe?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The figurines must be positioned on a grassy hilltop, which means there should be a visible ground surface beneath them that resembles grass, such as green texture with subtle variations simulating blades or terrain elevation.
Question: Are the figurines standing on a grassy hilltop surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: A tiny golden star must be suspended above the scene inside the globe. This requires a small, star-shaped object with a golden color floating in the air above the figurines, not touching any part of the scene.
Question: Is there a tiny golden star suspended above the figurines inside the globe?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Gentle, swirling snowflakes must be present inside the globe. These should be small, white, crystalline shapes moving in soft motion patterns, suggesting falling snow, visible within the glass enclosure.
Question: Are there gentle, swirling snowflakes visible inside the snow globe?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The base of the globe must be made of ornate wood with engraved patterns and include the inscription "Peace and Hope". The base should have a decorative design and legible text on its surface.
Question: Does the snow globe rest on an ornate wooden base with engraved patterns and the inscription "Peace and Hope"?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The clothing of the figurines must feature deep, rich hues to enhance the festive atmosphere. This means the colors should be saturated and dark, such as deep reds, purples, greens, or blues, rather than light or muted tones.
Question: Do the figurines' garments display deep, rich hues consistent with a festive atmosphere?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
