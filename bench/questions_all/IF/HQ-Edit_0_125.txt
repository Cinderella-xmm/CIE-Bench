Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the woman to be depicted in a semi-cartoon style, which implies stylized features such as exaggerated proportions, simplified facial details, smooth lines, and possibly larger eyes or softer shading compared to photorealism. This needs to be assessed by comparing the character’s rendering to realistic depictions.
Question: Is the woman rendered in a semi-cartoon style with stylized features such as smooth lines, simplified facial structure, and exaggerated proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The robe must have gold-embossed floral details, meaning visible golden highlights or raised textures on floral patterns that appear metallic or embossed. These should be distinct from regular embroidery and clearly enhanced for visual prominence.
Question: Are there visible gold-embossed floral details on the woman’s robe, particularly along the edges and central design areas?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Red lanterns with luminous glow surrounding her silhouette imply that the lanterns are not only present but also emit light that creates a soft halo effect around the woman, enhancing her presence in the scene.
Question: Do red lanterns surround the woman’s silhouette with a visible luminous glow effect?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Soft cream paper refers to a background texture or base layer resembling aged or textured cream-colored paper, commonly used in calendar designs. It should provide a subtle, non-distracting backdrop that complements the illustration.
Question: Is the background of the image designed to resemble soft cream-colored paper with a subtle texture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Each month's grid must be designed around the robe's floral patterns, indicating that the calendar layout includes monthly grids (e.g., 12 sections) whose borders or internal elements are shaped or decorated using motifs derived from the robe’s floral design.
Question: Are monthly calendar grids visibly integrated into the image, with their design based on the floral patterns from the woman’s robe?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The final output must function as a decorative market-themed calendar, meaning it should combine the market scene with calendar functionality. The theme must be consistent with a market setting, including stalls, produce, and festive decorations.
Question: Does the image include elements of a market scene—such as fruit stalls, hanging lanterns, and people shopping—and is it formatted as a calendar with monthly divisions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
