      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the entire image into a Byzantine mosaic on a golden backdrop. This implies that the visual texture should resemble small, colorful tiles (tesserae) arranged in patterns typical of Byzantine art, with a dominant gold background. The mosaic style must be visible across all elements, not just selectively applied.",
      "question": "Is the entire image rendered in a mosaic style composed of small, colored tesserae?",

      "question_id": "Q2",

      "question": "Are the sarees decorated with intricate peacock and vine patterns made from mosaic tesserae?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The Taj Mahal must be transformed into a domed basilica with arches leading to mythological scenes. This means the structure should no longer resemble the original Mughal architecture but instead feature large central domes, arched openings, and possibly narrative reliefs depicting mythological content.",
      "question": "Has the Taj Mahal been replaced with a domed basilica featuring arches that lead into scenes depicting mythological figures or narratives?",

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "question": "Are the figures posed in a solemn, upright ecclesiastical stance with hands folded or held in a reverent manner, consistent with Byzantine religious icons?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Floral motifs must be integrated into the scene. These should appear as part of the mosaic design—either on garments, background, or architectural elements—and be clearly identifiable as flowers (petals, stems, etc.) made from tesserae.",
      "question": "Are floral motifs visibly present throughout the image as part of the mosaic design, appearing on the sarees, background, or architecture?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The background must be a golden backdrop consistent with Byzantine mosaics, where gold leaf or gold-colored tesserae dominate the surface behind the figures and architecture.",
