This implies visible transparent glass panels, possibly with decorative framing, surrounding the scene. The presence of reflections or refractive effects on the glass surface would support this.",

      "question": "Do all elements in the scene—glass case, bonsai, jungle, base, and elephant—harmonize in style and color to create a cohesive, elegant natural theme?",
