Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the fox should have exaggerated facial expressions. This implies visible features such as oversized eyes, wide mouth, or prominent eyebrows that are not typical of realistic depictions. These elements must be clearly observable.
Question: Does the fox have exaggerated facial features such as large eyes, wide mouth, or prominent eyebrows?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the fox to wear a small leaf crown. This means a decorative headpiece made of leaves must be visible on the fox’s head, placed like a crown.
Question: Is there a small leaf crown visible on the fox’s head?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The fox must be standing on its hind legs, which is a significant change from the original seated pose. This posture must be clearly evident with both front paws off the ground.
Question: Is the fox standing upright on its hind legs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the fox must gesture with one paw extended, indicating an active, guiding motion. This requires at least one front paw to be raised and pointing forward or outward.
Question: Is one of the fox’s front paws extended forward in a gesturing motion?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The backdrop must include other animals listening attentively. This means additional animal characters should be present in the background, facing the fox with focused expressions.
Question: Are there other animals in the background that appear to be listening intently to the fox?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The trees in the background must have playful, minimalist outlines, meaning simplified shapes with clean lines, possibly lacking detailed textures or bark patterns, and stylized rather than realistic.
Question: Do the trees in the background have simple, stylized outlines instead of realistic details?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The color palette must convert greens to vibrant pastels. This means all green areas—such as moss, foliage, and grass—should be rendered in soft, bright pastel tones like mint, lavender, or pale yellow, not natural green.
Question: Have the green areas in the image been replaced with vibrant pastel colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: A speech bubble must be present with the exact text “Follow me to the magical glade!” written in it. This requires checking both presence and content.
Question: Is there a speech bubble containing the text “Follow me to the magical glade!”?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q9:
Thinking process: The font in the speech bubble must be bubbly, meaning rounded, playful, and cartoonish in style, not plain or serif.
Question: Is the text in the speech bubble written in a bubbly, cartoon-style font?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q10:
Thinking process: The overall scene must be whimsical and cartoon-like, implying exaggerated proportions, bright colors, and stylized elements consistent with children's animation or fantasy art.
Question: Does the entire scene exhibit a whimsical, cartoon-like aesthetic with exaggerated features and playful design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
