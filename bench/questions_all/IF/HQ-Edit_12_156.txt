Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the Eiffel Tower into a fantasy beacon, which implies a shift from a metallic industrial structure to one that emits magical or mystical energy. This transformation should be visually evident through non-metallic materials, luminous effects, and fantastical design elements.
Question: Is the Eiffel Tower depicted as a fantasy beacon emitting mystical energy rather than a standard metallic structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The metal lattice must be replaced with enchanted vines and glowing floral motifs. This requires visible organic textures replacing steel beams, with bioluminescent or glowing floral patterns integrated into the structure.
Question: Are the original metal lattice components replaced with enchanted vines and glowing floral motifs throughout the tower?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The top of the tower must culminate in a crystal pinnacle, indicating a transparent, faceted, and likely luminous capstone at the apex, differing from the original spire.
Question: Does the top of the tower feature a crystal-like pinnacle instead of the original metallic spire?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The base of the tower must be replaced with an ancient stone platform bearing arcane symbols. This means the current foundation should be substituted with weathered stone and clearly visible symbolic engravings resembling runes or magical inscriptions.
Question: Has the base of the tower been replaced with an ancient stone platform featuring engraved arcane symbols?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The sunset backdrop must be transformed to include swirling nebulae that reflect the tower's radiant aura. This implies celestial cloud formations with colors and light patterns mirroring the glow from the tower, creating a cosmic atmosphere.
Question: Does the background sky contain swirling nebulae that visually reflect the radiant glow emanating from the tower?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
