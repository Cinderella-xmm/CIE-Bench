Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly requires transforming the sparrow into an adventurous character by adding a tiny explorer hat. This implies a small, recognizable hat (such as a pith helmet or similar) positioned on the bird's head, proportionally scaled to its size. The presence of this object must be directly observable.
Question: Is there a tiny explorer hat visible on the sparrow's head?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: A miniature backpack must be added to the sparrow, which implies a small, wearable bag attached to its back. It should be proportionally sized and visually distinct from the bird’s feathers. The backpack must be clearly visible and not obscured.
Question: Is there a miniature backpack attached to the sparrow’s back?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies emphasizing the bird's fluffy plumage in warm, earthy tones. This means the feathers should appear soft and voluminous, with colors such as brown, tan, ochre, or rust—colors that convey warmth and texture. Observers should notice enhanced fluffiness and appropriate color palette.
Question: Are the sparrow's feathers rendered with a fluffy texture and warm, earthy tones (e.g., browns, tans, rust)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The oak leaves must be replaced with a stylized map showing a forest and tiny treasure icons. This transformation requires removing all real leaves and replacing them with a drawn map featuring forest patterns and symbols like X marks, stars, or chests. The map should be clearly visible above or around the bird.
Question: Have the oak leaves been replaced with a stylized map depicting a forest and tiny treasure icons?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The title "The Sparrow's Secret Adventure" must be present in a whimsical, child-friendly font at the top of the image. The font should be playful (e.g., rounded, bouncy letters), and there should be decorative swirling elements surrounding the text to enhance the whimsical feel.
Question: Is the title "The Sparrow's Secret Adventure" displayed in a whimsical, child-friendly font at the top of the image with playful swirling elements around it?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The original composition features the sparrow perched on a mossy branch. The instruction does not require changing the bird’s position or the branch, so these elements must remain intact. The branch should still be visible with moss, and the bird should be centered or naturally positioned on it.
Question: Is the sparrow still perched on the same moss-covered branch as in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
