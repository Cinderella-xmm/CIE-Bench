Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the teapot into a cylindrical container. This requires changing the shape from a traditional rounded teapot to a straight-sided cylinder while maintaining its function as a tea container. The new form must be clearly cylindrical, not just modified but fundamentally reshaped.
Question: Is the teapot now a cylindrical container instead of its original rounded shape?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires embossing floral patterns in golden foil. This implies visible raised textures and a metallic gold sheen on the surface of the container. The floral design must be present and rendered with a reflective, foil-like finish, distinguishable from painted or printed patterns.
Question: Are floral patterns embossed in golden foil on the surface of the teapot container?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The cups must be redesigned as nested stackable teacups with decorative lids. This means the individual cups should be sized progressively smaller so they can fit inside one another, and each cup must have a lid that matches its design. The nesting structure must be visually apparent.
Question: Are the teacups redesigned as nested stackable units, each with a decorative lid?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for branding across the top with Japanese calligraphy. This means there should be visible text in Japanese script positioned at the top of the packaging, likely centered or aligned horizontally. The calligraphy must be legible and stylistically appropriate (e.g., brushstroke style).
Question: Is there Japanese calligraphy displayed across the top of the packaging design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A bamboo motif must be added along the side. This refers to a visual element resembling bamboo stalks or leaves integrated into the side of the packaging. It should be stylistically consistent with Japanese aesthetics and clearly distinguishable as a bamboo pattern.
Question: Is a bamboo motif visible along the side of the packaging?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The final presentation must be on a flat white surface to achieve a refined, elegant look. This implies the background is plain white, with no textured matting or wooden flooring visible. The entire product must appear isolated and clean, emphasizing minimalism and elegance.
Question: Is the entire tea set packaging presented on a flat white surface with no other background elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
