      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the map into a scroll form that is partially unfurled and floating above a stylized ocean. This implies a change in shape (from flat to rolled), positioning (floating), and background context (ocean beneath). Observable features include visible curling edges, a sense of elevation, and water-like textures below.",
      "question": "Is the map rendered as a partially unfurled scroll floating above a stylized ocean?",

      "thinking_process": "The compass must be transformed into a golden ship's wheel with elaborate engravings. This requires replacing the circular compass face with a wheel-like structure featuring spokes, nautical details, and ornate patterns consistent with a ship's helm. The material should appear metallic and reflective.",

      "thinking_process": "Miniature explorers are required as silhouettes on the map, showing motion. This means small human-shaped dark figures placed along the map’s surface, possibly in dynamic poses (e.g., walking, pointing) to suggest movement.",
      "question": "Are there miniature silhouettes of explorers depicted on the map, showing motion?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The color scheme must retain the original brown tones but add glowing gold highlights from lanterns. This implies ambient lighting effects resembling lantern glow, particularly around key elements like the ship’s wheel or scroll edges, without altering the base palette.",
      "question": "Are glowing gold highlights present, simulating light from lanterns, while preserving the original brown tones of the map?",

      "thinking_process": "Historical routes must be clearly marked as dotted red lines across the map, indicating paths taken by explorers. These lines should be distinct, evenly spaced, and follow logical geographic paths.",
      "question": "Are well-defined historical routes shown as vibrant dotted red lines on the map?",
