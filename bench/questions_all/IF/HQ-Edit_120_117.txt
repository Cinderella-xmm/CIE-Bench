- Transform the lighthouse scene into a nautical globe display
- Inside the globe: A miniature 3D lighthouse model stands on rocky terrain surrounded by stylized crashing waves made from translucent blue resin
- Globe base: A wooden base with engraved compass rose pattern
- Background elements: Add painted clouds and a distant mountain panorama for depth
- Color palette: Earthy tones for rocks and vibrant blues for water

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the entire lighthouse scene into a nautical globe display. This implies that the original image must be recontextualized as being contained within a spherical globe, not just modified in content. The key visual change is the framing of the scene inside a transparent globe structure.
Question: Is the entire lighthouse scene enclosed within a spherical glass or transparent globe?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires a miniature 3D lighthouse model inside the globe. This means the lighthouse should appear smaller and more detailed, consistent with a scaled-down model rather than the full-sized real-world version seen in the original image.
Question: Is the lighthouse inside the globe depicted as a miniature 3D model rather than a full-scale structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The waves surrounding the lighthouse inside the globe are specified to be made of translucent blue resin, which implies a glossy, semi-transparent material with visible internal refraction and stylized form, different from natural ocean waves.
Question: Are the waves around the lighthouse inside the globe made of translucent blue resin with a stylized appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The globe base must be wooden and feature an engraved compass rose pattern. This is a specific design element that must be present at the bottom of the globe, indicating its nautical theme.
Question: Does the globe rest on a wooden base with an engraved compass rose pattern?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The background elements must include painted clouds and a distant mountain panorama to add depth. These should not be real sky or landscape but artistic additions that enhance the sense of depth behind the globe.
Question: Are painted clouds and a distant mountain panorama visible in the background behind the globe?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The color palette must use earthy tones for rocks and vibrant blues for water. This refers to the color scheme applied specifically to the rocky terrain and water elements inside the globe.
Question: Are the rocks inside the globe rendered in earthy tones (such as browns, tans, and greens) and the water in vibrant shades of blue?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
