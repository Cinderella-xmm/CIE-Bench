      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the image into a travel poster. This implies that the overall composition should resemble a promotional poster, with clear visual focus and thematic elements aligned with tourism. A key indicator is whether the image has a structured layout typical of posters, such as centered focal points and textual integration.",
      "question": "Is the overall composition arranged like a travel poster with a central subject and promotional intent?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies a vintage 1950s aesthetic, which is characterized by specific visual traits such as soft color palettes, rounded forms, and stylized graphics. To evaluate this, we must check if the image uses design elements typical of mid-century advertising, such as simplified shapes and nostalgic motifs.",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit visual characteristics of a 1950s vintage style, such as rounded forms and stylized graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The requirement to flatten colors into pastel tones means that the original vibrant or natural colors (e.g., deep blues, purples) should be replaced with softer, muted hues like light pink, lavender, mint green, or pale yellow. This transformation should apply broadly across the image, especially the sky, sea, and sand.",
      "question": "Are all major elements (sky, sea, sand, octopus) rendered in pastel tones rather than natural or saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly calls for bold brush outlines around the octopus. This means visible, thick, hand-drawn-style lines should define the edges of the octopus, giving it a cartoonish or illustrated appearance consistent with retro art styles.",
      "question": "Does the octopus have clearly visible, thick, brush-like outlines defining its shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The beach must be transformed into a playful paradise scene, implying additions such as palm trees, tropical flowers, colorful umbrellas, or whimsical elements like seashell decorations or smiling suns. The environment should feel lighthearted and fantastical.",
      "question": "Has the beach been modified to include playful paradise elements such as palm trees, flowers, or other whimsical decorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires adding specific text in a curvy retro font across the top. The text must read exactly \"Escape to Adventure at Tentacle Shores\" and be styled in a way typical of 1950s advertisingâ€”such as flowing script or rounded letterforms with decorative flourishes.",
      "question": "Is the text \"Escape to Adventure at Tentacle Shores\" present at the top of the image in a curvy, retro-style font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
