Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies replacing the original black bottle cap with an elegant glass stopper. This implies a change in material (from plastic/rubber to glass), shape (likely more refined and transparent), and aesthetic (elegant). A glass stopper should be visually distinct from the current black cap.
Question: Has the black bottle cap been replaced with a transparent or translucent glass stopper?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires adding thin, dark diffuser reeds that protrude from the top of the bottle. These are characteristic elements of a fragrance diffuser and must be visibly present extending upward from the stopper.
Question: Are thin, dark-colored reeds visible protruding from the top of the bottle?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The label must now feature an art deco design, which includes geometric patterns, symmetry, bold lines, and stylized typography—distinct from the current circular logo and text layout. The visual style must reflect this specific artistic movement.
Question: Does the label display an art deco design with geometric patterns, symmetrical elements, or stylized fonts?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The branding color scheme must be changed to a rich emerald green and gold combination. This means the dominant colors on the label and any visible branding elements should now include these two hues, replacing the current gold and black.
Question: Is the label predominantly colored in emerald green and gold, replacing the original color scheme?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The label must include floral and botanical illustrations as part of the enhanced aesthetic appeal. These should be visible as decorative elements such as leaves, flowers, or plant motifs integrated into the design.
Question: Are floral or botanical illustrations (such as flowers, leaves, or plants) present on the label?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The overall object must be transformed into a luxury home fragrance diffuser. This means the bottle’s function has changed from containing whisky to dispersing fragrance via reeds, which is reflected by the presence of reeds, new cap, and updated labeling. The entire composition should suggest a perfume or aroma product rather than alcohol.
Question: Has the bottle been transformed into a functional-looking luxury fragrance diffuser with all associated components (stopper, reeds, redesigned label)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
