- Transform the motorcycle into a sci-fi themed collectible figure
- Display the figure in an isometric box
- Add futuristic elements: glowing neon accents, hover wheels, and a sleek digital interface
- Label the box “FUTURE RIDER”
- Include a transparent window showcasing the figure
- Beside the box, illustrate an ultra-realistic version of the motorcycle with advanced textures and metallic finishes

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the motorcycle into a sci-fi themed collectible figure. This implies a shift from a real-world object to a stylized, toy-like representation with exaggerated proportions or design features typical of collectibles. A key indicator is whether the motorcycle now appears as a miniature figure rather than a full-scale vehicle.
Question: Has the motorcycle been transformed into a collectible-style figure with simplified or stylized proportions suitable for display?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the figure must be displayed in an isometric box. Isometric perspective means a 3D view with equal angles (typically 30 degrees) for depth and width, giving a clear sense of volume without perspective distortion. The presence of such a box must be visually identifiable.
Question: Is the collectible figure placed inside a box rendered in isometric projection?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly mentions adding futuristic elements such as glowing neon accents, hover wheels, and a digital interface. These are specific visual features that must be observable: neon lights should emit visible glow, hover wheels should lack physical contact with ground, and a digital interface could appear as holographic displays or LED panels.
Question: Does the motorcycle feature glowing neon accents, hover wheels, and a visible digital interface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The box must be labeled "FUTURE RIDER." This is a textual requirement, so the label must be clearly legible and positioned on the box. It must not be obscured or misspelled.
Question: Is the text "FUTURE RIDER" clearly visible and correctly spelled on the box?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction requires a transparent window on the box to showcase the figure. Transparency implies visibility through the material, allowing the internal figure to be seen. This must be distinguishable from solid walls.
Question: Is there a transparent section on the box that reveals the collectible figure inside?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies an ultra-realistic version of the motorcycle displayed beside the box. This version must show high detail, including advanced textures (e.g., reflections, surface imperfections), metallic finishes, and realistic lighting effects. It must be separate from the collectible figure.
Question: Is there a second depiction of the motorcycle next to the box that displays ultra-realistic textures and metallic finishes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
