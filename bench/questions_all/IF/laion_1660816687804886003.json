      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the entire sneaker into an energy drink can. This implies a complete shape change from footwear to cylindrical beverage container, maintaining visual elements from the original shoe. The core transformation must be evident in the overall structure.",
      "question": "Is the object now shaped like a modern energy drink can instead of a sneaker?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The navy blue mesh pattern is a key material feature of the original shoe. The instruction specifies using this pattern to style the can, meaning it should cover part or all of the can’s surface in a visible and consistent way, resembling the texture seen on the shoe.",
      "question": "Does the can feature the navy blue mesh pattern from the original sneaker?",

      "thinking_process": "The brand logo (the circular emblem with red and blue segments) is a distinct visual element on the side of the shoe. The instruction explicitly states to place this logo on the front of the can, so its presence and correct placement are essential.",
      "question": "Is the brand logo (circular emblem with red and blue sections) visible on the front of the can?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The bold laces are described as being incorporated as embossed texture around the can. This means the laces' appearance—thick, dark blue, and structured—should be transformed into raised, tactile-like patterns encircling the can’s body.",
      "question": "Are the bold laces represented as embossed or raised textures wrapped around the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The sole features three navy blue stripes on a white background. The instruction specifies these should be used as a dynamic pattern on the bottom half of the can. This means the stripes must appear near the base, arranged in a visually striking way that mimics motion or energy.",
      "question": "Do the three navy blue stripes from the sole appear as a dynamic pattern on the bottom half of the can?",

        "Yes",

      "question": "Is the word \"Kickstart\" written in red lettering on the white upper portion of the can?",
