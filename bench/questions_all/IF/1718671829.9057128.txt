Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the wooden cabin into geometric shapes with flattened structural lines. This means that organic or natural forms of the cabin—such as curved beams or irregular rooflines—must be replaced with sharp angles, straight edges, and simplified block-like structures typical of Art Deco design. The transformation should eliminate depth cues and emphasize two-dimensional flatness.
Question: Are the structural lines of the cabin composed entirely of geometric shapes with no organic curves?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The moon must be stylized as a radiant circle, implying it should not appear as a realistic lunar surface but rather as a glowing, symmetrical orb with rays or halos emanating from it, consistent with Art Deco's use of symbolic and decorative celestial elements.
Question: Is the moon depicted as a glowing, radiant circle with visible light rays or halo effects?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Plants in the original image are natural and asymmetrical. The instruction specifies converting them into symmetric patterns, which means they should be arranged in mirrored, repeating designs, possibly resembling mandalas or stylized foliage common in Art Deco ornamentation.
Question: Are the plants rendered in symmetrical, patterned arrangements instead of natural growth forms?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Metallic tones with gold and silver accents are required. This implies the color palette should include reflective surfaces, chrome-like finishes, and prominent use of gold and silver hues on architectural elements, frames, or decorative features.
Question: Are metallic textures and colors (gold and silver) visibly applied to key elements such as the cabin frame, windows, or decorative motifs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Stylized clouds need to be added. In Art Deco style, clouds would likely be abstracted into angular, sweeping forms with sharp edges or fan-like shapes, often used as background embellishments.
Question: Are there abstract, geometrically shaped clouds present in the sky?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Window details must be enhanced with bold dynamics. This suggests the windows should feature strong visual contrasts—such as thick borders, angular panes, or decorative grilles—and may include radiating lines or stepped patterns typical of Art Deco architecture.
Question: Do the windows display bold, dynamic features such as thick frames, angular divisions, or radiating patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The overall scene must reflect an Art Deco poster style, meaning it should include strong symmetry, high contrast, geometric composition, and decorative elements like zigzags, sunbursts, or stylized lettering (even if text is absent). The entire image should feel flat and graphic rather than three-dimensional.
Question: Does the entire image exhibit a flat, graphic quality with strong symmetry, angular lines, and decorative elements characteristic of Art Deco posters?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
