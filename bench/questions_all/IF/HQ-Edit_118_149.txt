```
- Convert the ballet dancer's pose into two distinct stickers
- One sticker should feature softened pastel colors emphasizing grace
- The other sticker should have sharp geometric angles for a modern flair
- Add detachable sections around her leg for dynamic layering effects
- Place both stickers on a sleek, beige journal
- Ensure the stickers are visually separated and layered to reflect dynamic composition

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires splitting the original image of the ballet dancer into two separate sticker designs. This implies that the dancer’s pose must be duplicated or reinterpreted in two different visual styles, each forming a standalone sticker element.
Question: Is the ballet dancer's pose represented as two distinct sticker versions in the edited image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies one sticker with "softened pastel colors emphasizing grace." This refers to a color palette dominated by gentle, muted tones (e.g., light pinks, lavenders, soft blues) and smooth gradients, avoiding harsh contrasts or sharp lines.
Question: Does one of the stickers use a pastel color scheme with soft gradients and gentle tones to convey grace?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The second sticker must exhibit "sharp geometric angles for a modern flair," which implies stylized forms with straight edges, angular lines, and possibly abstract shapes replacing natural contours—distinct from the organic form of the original dancer.
Question: Does one of the stickers feature sharp geometric lines and angular forms to create a modern aesthetic?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction mentions adding "detachable sections around her leg" for dynamic layering effects. This suggests that parts of the dancer’s leg or surrounding area are segmented or broken into movable pieces, allowing for visual depth and interactivity in the sticker design.
Question: Are there visible detachable or segmented sections around the dancer's leg in at least one of the stickers to enable dynamic layering?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The final placement requirement is that the stickers are positioned on a "sleek, beige journal." This means the background of the edited image should show a journal with a neutral beige tone, smooth surface, and appropriate proportions to serve as a display surface for the stickers.
Question: Are both stickers placed on a beige-colored journal with a smooth, sleek appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
