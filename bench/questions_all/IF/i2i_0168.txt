```
-Replace the background with snow and icebergs 
-Place the carrots in an Arctic environment
-Maintain the carrots rooted in soil 
-Create a contrast between the extreme Arctic climate and the carrots in soil
```


```
Q1: 
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly mentions changing the background to an arctic environment with snow and icebergs. An Arctic environment typically includes visible snow and possibly icebergs. Therefore, this question checks if the background has been correctly changed.
Question: Is the background replaced with snow and icebergs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2: 
Thinking process: The carrots need to remain in their original state, rooted in soil despite the change in the surrounding environment. This question ensures that the carrots are still visibly rooted in soil.
Question: Are the carrots still rooted in soil?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3: 
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the carrots should remain unaltered except for the background transformation. This question checks if the carrots maintain their original appearance and positioning within the soil.
Question: Do the carrots retain their original appearance in terms of color and form?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4: 
Thinking process: The task requires creating a contrast between the carrots in soil and the severe Arctic surroundings. The presence of snow and icebergs should create the sense of an extreme climate. This question verifies whether this contrast was achieved successfully.
Question: Does the image show a clear contrast between the Arctic background and the soil around the carrots?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5: 
Thinking process: The instruction specifies placing the carrot field in an Arctic environment. This question ensures that the overall setting aligns with an Arctic environment, reinforcing the previous points about background and contrast.
Question: Is the overall setting of the image consistent with an Arctic environment?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
