      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies replacing the Japanese house’s structure with colored glass panels framed by black lead. This implies that all architectural components—walls, roof, windows, railings—should be rendered as translucent colored glass sections outlined by dark, linear lead cames, mimicking traditional stained glass construction. The original solid wooden or tiled appearance must be fully replaced.",
      "question": "Are all structural elements of the Japanese house rendered as colored glass panels bounded by black lead lines?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The red trees are to be transformed into floral motifs composed of red and green segments. This means the tree forms should no longer resemble natural foliage but instead be stylized into flower-like shapes using distinct red and green colored segments, consistent with stained glass artistry.",
      "question": "Are the red trees replaced with stylized floral motifs made of red and green segmented glass pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The large red moon must be depicted using gradient circles, meaning it should not be a solid color but rather composed of concentric or overlapping circular bands of varying red tones, creating a sense of depth and luminosity typical of stained glass representations.",
      "question": "Is the large red moon rendered using multiple overlapping or concentric gradient circles in shades of red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes line detailing, which in stained glass context means clear, bold outlines (lead lines) defining each colored segment. These lines should be prominent and consistent across all elements—house, trees, moon—to reinforce the stained glass aesthetic.",
      "question": "Are all major elements (house, trees, moon) clearly outlined with thick, black, continuous lines resembling lead came in stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "While transforming the image into stained glass, the original spatial layout—such as the position of the house, trees on either side, moon in the sky, and water reflection—must be preserved. The reflection in the water should also follow the stained glass style, showing mirrored glass patterns.",
      "question": "Does the overall scene maintain the original composition (house centered, trees flanking, moon above, water in foreground) while all elements are styled as stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
