Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies a "cartoon style" with "exaggerated tutu designs". This implies a transformation from realistic to stylized art, including simplified features, bold outlines, and an enlarged or more voluminous tutu compared to the original. The cartoon style also suggests less realism in proportions and textures.
Question: Is the ballerina depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated proportions and a significantly larger or more voluminous tutu than in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires soft pastel shades for the background. This means the background should not be dark or neutral but instead feature gentle colors such as light pink, lavender, mint green, or baby blue. The color tone must be soft and non-saturated.
Question: Is the background of the image composed of soft pastel shades such as light pink, lavender, or mint green?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Glitter accents on the costume imply visible sparkles or shimmering elements added to the ballerina's dress, particularly on the bodice or tutu. These should be noticeable as small reflective dots or lines, especially under light.
Question: Are there visible glitter accents (such as sparkling dots or shimmering patterns) added to the ballerina’s costume?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies integrating blank spaces for messages, which means there must be clearly defined areas—such as rectangular or curved zones—on the postcard layout where text can be added without overlapping key visual elements.
Question: Are there clearly designated blank areas on the image suitable for adding written messages?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Floral motifs on the borders suggest decorative flower patterns along the edges of the image, such as roses, daisies, or vines, enhancing elegance. These should frame the central figure and be stylistically consistent with the cartoon theme.
Question: Are there floral motifs (such as flowers or leaves) present along the borders of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
