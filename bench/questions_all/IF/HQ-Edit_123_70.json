    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the original image into a two-panel comic. This means the single image must now be divided into two distinct sections (left and right or top and bottom), each serving a specific narrative purpose. The presence of two separate visual panels is essential to meet this requirement.",
      "question": "Is the image split into two distinct panels, one on the left and one on the right (or top and bottom), forming a comic layout?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The bear must be reimagined as an elder forest guide, which implies anthropomorphic traits such as wearing spectacles and displaying a wise facial expression. These elements must be visually present in Panel 1 to satisfy the character transformation requirement.",
      "question": "Does Panel 1 show the bear wearing spectacles and displaying a wise or thoughtful facial expression?",

      "question": "Is there a speech bubble in Panel 1 containing the text: “Ever wondered how a salmon ends up in a bear's mouth?”",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Panel 2 must depict the salmon emerging from bubbling water and transitioning through a visual chart of its life stages. The chart should clearly show the progression from egg to adult, with each stage labeled. This requires both dynamic motion (bubbling water) and structured labeling.",
      "question": "Does Panel 2 show a salmon emerging from bubbling water into a visual chart with labeled stages: 'egg', 'fry', 'smolt', 'adult'?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires a fact box in Panel 2 with the specific text: “Journey's end in the river gives life to the forest.” This must appear as a separate text box, not integrated into the main narrative, and must use the correct wording.",
      "question": "Is there a fact box in Panel 2 containing the text: “Journey's end in the river gives life to the forest.”?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The text throughout the comic must use a clear, modern sans-serif font. This ensures readability and aligns with educational design standards. Observing the font style in all text elements (speech bubble, labels, fact box) is necessary.",
      "question": "Are all text elements (speech bubble, labels, fact box) rendered in a clear, modern sans-serif font?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies maintaining realistic color fidelity, particularly using blue hues for water-related elements and brown-green tones for the forest environment. This means water should appear blue, and the forest background should retain natural earthy and green tones.",
      "question": "Are the water elements in Panel 2 depicted in blue hues and the forest background in Panel 1 shown in brown-green tones?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q9",
      "thinking_process": "The comic must maintain visual clarity and an informative flow, meaning transitions between panels should be logical, text legible, and imagery coherent. This involves checking whether the content of each panel supports the educational narrative without confusion.",
      "question": "Is the visual content of both panels clear, logically connected, and suitable for educational purposes?",
