- Transform warrior figures into tropical fish-shaped plush toys
- Replace brown plastic with soft, vibrant fabrics featuring bold patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow
- Soften shapes by exaggerating fins and tails while maintaining dynamic poses
- Display plush fish creatively arranged on a sandy fabric surface to resemble a serene underwater scene
- Maintain the original figures' dynamic poses in the transformation
- Ensure materials appear soft and plush-like (not rigid or plastic)
- Use vibrant colors including blue, green, red, and yellow in bold patterns
- Create an underwater scene ambiance through background and arrangement

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly requires transforming the warrior figures into tropical fish-shaped plush toys. This means the core identity of each figure must shift from humanoid minotaur warriors to fish forms, retaining only the dynamic pose as a structural guide. The shape should now resemble a fish with exaggerated fins and tail.
Question: Are the four figures transformed into fish-shaped forms with visible fins and tails?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The material change is central to the editâ€”brown plastic must be replaced with soft, vibrant fabrics. This implies a visual shift from rigid, matte brown plastic to textured, colorful fabric that appears soft and pliable. The texture should suggest plushness rather than hard plastic.
Question: Do the figures appear to be made of soft fabric instead of rigid plastic?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies vibrant fabrics with bold patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow. These colors must be clearly visible and not limited to one or two hues. Patterns should be distinct and contribute to a tropical aesthetic.
Question: Are the figures covered in vibrant patterns using blue, green, red, and yellow colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction requires softening the shapes by exaggerating fins and tails. This means the anatomical features of the fish (like dorsal, pectoral, and caudal fins) should be enlarged and stylized compared to their original warrior forms, but still maintain the dynamic posture of the original figures.
Question: Are the fins and tails of the fish figures exaggerated in size and shape compared to the original warrior limbs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The final display context is specified: the plush fish should be arranged on a sandy fabric surface to resemble a serene underwater scene. This includes both the surface texture (sandy) and the overall composition suggesting an aquatic environment.
Question: Are the plush figures arranged on a sandy-textured fabric surface that resembles an underwater scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction emphasizes maintaining the dynamic poses of the original figures. Even though they are transformed into fish, their movement and stance (e.g., lunging, wielding weapons) should be preserved in the new form.
Question: Do the fish-shaped plush toys retain the dynamic, action-oriented poses of the original warrior figures?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
