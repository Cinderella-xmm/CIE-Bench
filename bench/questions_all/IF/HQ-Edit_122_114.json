      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly requires transforming the stork's feathers into metallic plates. This involves replacing organic textures with industrial ones, such as riveted metal sheets or armored plating, particularly visible on the wings, body, and head. The transformation must preserve the storkâ€™s form but alter its material appearance.",
      "question": "Are the stork's feathers replaced with metallic plates, such as riveted or segmented metal surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The original nest is made of twigs; the instruction specifies replacing them with cogs and gears. This means the nest should be composed entirely of interlocking mechanical parts resembling clockwork components, not natural materials.",
      "question": "Are the nest materials composed entirely of cogs, gears, and mechanical parts instead of natural twigs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Copper pipes are specifically mentioned to be added along the roof. This implies visible tubing running along the eaves or ridge of the roof, consistent with Steampunk aesthetics involving exposed piping and steam conduits.",
      "question": "Are copper-colored pipes visibly integrated along the roofline of the wooden house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Mechanical joints are required to emphasize an industrial aesthetic, meaning articulating points such as elbows, knees, or necks should appear as hinges, pistons, or ball-and-socket mechanisms rather than organic limbs.",
      "question": "Does the stork have visible mechanical joints at key limb connections (e.g., legs, neck, wings)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The overall style must reflect a Steampunk theme, which includes not only specific elements like gears and pipes but also consistent use of materials (brass, copper, steel), aged or patinated finishes, and integration of machinery into biological forms. This holistic evaluation ensures thematic consistency.",
      "question": "Is the entire scene rendered in a Steampunk style, with consistent use of mechanical components, metallic textures, and industrial design across both the stork and the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
