Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the teapot into a candle design, meaning the overall form should now represent a candle. This involves changing the functional elements (spout, lid) to match a candle’s structure, such as a wick and flame-like top. The core shape must remain recognizable as derived from the original teapot but reinterpreted as a candle.
Question: Has the teapot been transformed into a candle design, with the overall object now resembling a candle?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies using the teapot as the glass base. This implies that the body of the teapot remains structurally intact but is now interpreted as a transparent or translucent glass container for wax. The material transformation is critical here—metallic surfaces must be replaced with a glass-like appearance.
Question: Is the body of the object now rendered with a transparent or translucent glass-like finish consistent with a candle base?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The metallic texture of the original teapot must be translated into a high-gloss ceramic finish. This means the surface should appear smooth, reflective, and non-metallic, resembling glazed porcelain or ceramic rather than polished silver or metal.
Question: Does the surface of the object exhibit a high-gloss ceramic finish instead of a metallic one?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The spout must be replaced with a wick. In candle design, the wick is typically a thin, vertical element protruding from the top center. It should not resemble a spout anymore but instead look like a realistic candle wick, possibly slightly curved or frayed at the tip.
Question: Has the spout been replaced with a visible wick extending from the top of the object?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The handle must be converted into a decorative gold accent. This means the wooden or metallic handle should no longer function as a grip but should be redesigned as an ornamental gold feature, possibly stylized or gilded, integrated into the candle's design.
Question: Has the handle been transformed into a decorative gold accent rather than retaining its original functional form?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A subtle floral pattern must be added around the base of the candle. This implies delicate flower motifs, possibly etched or painted, located near the bottom edge of the glass base. The pattern should be present but not dominant.
Question: Is there a subtle floral pattern visible around the base of the object?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The name "Eternal Elegance Candle" must be displayed in elegant script at the front. This requires legible cursive or calligraphic text positioned on the front-facing side of the candle base. The font should be refined and matching the luxury aesthetic.
Question: Is the text "Eternal Elegance Candle" written in elegant script on the front of the object?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
