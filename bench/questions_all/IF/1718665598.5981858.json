      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the scene into a surreal cubist tapestry. Cubism is characterized by fragmentation and reassembly of objects into geometric planes. This means that the original continuous forms (like the road, sky, and trees) must be broken into angular, interlocking shapes rather than realistic depictions.",
      "question": "Are the elements of the scene (road, sky, trees, poles) fragmented into geometric shapes such as polygons, rectangles, and triangles?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The road must be emphasized as angular and non-realistic, consistent with cubist style. A realistic curved road should be replaced with sharp angles and disjointed segments to reflect geometric abstraction.",
      "question": "Is the road composed of angular, non-smooth sections instead of a smooth, curving surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Overlapping quadrilateral clouds are explicitly required. In cubist art, clouds are not depicted realistically but as layered, flat, geometric forms. The presence of multiple intersecting or stacked quadrilateral shapes in the sky indicates compliance.",
      "question": "Are the clouds represented as overlapping quadrilateral or polygonal shapes rather than soft, natural cloud formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Telegraph poles must be stylized to match the cubist aestheticâ€”this implies they should not resemble real wooden poles but instead appear as abstract, angular structures made of straight lines and right angles, possibly fragmented or repeated in geometric patterns.",
      "question": "Are the telegraph poles rendered in a stylized, geometric form using angular lines and shapes rather than realistic proportions and textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Trees must be abstracted into triangular forms, which is a key feature of the requested style. Realistic foliage should be replaced with simplified, sharp-edged triangular silhouettes, consistent with geometric abstraction.",
      "question": "Are the trees depicted as abstract triangular shapes rather than natural, rounded tree canopies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The color palette must strictly adhere to muted greens, grays, and deep yellows. This excludes bright or saturated colors and emphasizes desaturated tones typical of a somber, abstract mood. Observers should see no dominant blues, reds, or whites beyond those implied by the specified palette.",
      "question": "Does the image use only muted greens, grays, and deep yellows, avoiding bright or saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall composition must still convey a road stretching into the distance under stormy skies, even if abstracted. While transformed, the sense of depth and perspective should remain recognizable through geometric layering and spatial arrangement.",
      "question": "Is there a clear sense of depth and perspective in the scene, with the road leading toward a distant horizon despite the geometric abstraction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
