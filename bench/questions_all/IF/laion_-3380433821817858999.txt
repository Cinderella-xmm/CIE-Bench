```
- Transform the figure into an anime-style tutorial infographic titled “Master the Power Jump”
- Include dynamic step-by-step illustrations
- Step 1: "Positioning: Kneel with bent arms back." Add a simple figure in starting pose
- Step 2: "Leap Attack: Propel using core strength." Show explosive movement
- Step 3: "Mid-Air Adjustment: Tuck knees tightly." Illustrate agility
- Design aesthetic with bold outlines, vibrant colors focusing on blues and whites
- Captions in energetic fonts
- Maintain the original character’s appearance in the main figure but integrate it into a tutorial format
- Ensure all steps are clearly illustrated and labeled

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the image into a tutorial infographic. This implies the presence of multiple panels or sections showing different stages of the action. The original image is a single static figure, so the edit must include at least three distinct illustrated steps. The question checks whether the layout has been changed to reflect a multi-panel tutorial format.
Question: Is the image now structured as a multi-panel infographic with at least three distinct steps?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The first step explicitly states "Positioning: Kneel with bent arms back" and requires adding a simple figure in that pose. This means there should be a separate illustration showing a kneeling stance with arms pulled back. The question verifies if this specific pose is included and correctly labeled.
Question: Is there a panel showing a simple figure in a kneeling position with bent arms pulled back, labeled as "Step 1: Positioning: Kneel with bent arms back"?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The second step describes "Leap Attack: Propel using core strength" and requires illustrating explosive movement. This implies dynamic motion lines, a forward-leaping posture, and visual cues of force or energy. The question checks whether this stage is depicted with appropriate action indicators.
Question: Is there a panel showing an explosive leaping motion with visual cues of propulsion (e.g., motion lines, energy burst), labeled as "Step 2: Leap Attack: Propel using core strength"?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The third step specifies "Mid-Air Adjustment: Tuck knees tightly" and requires illustrating agility. This means the figure should be shown mid-air with knees tucked in, demonstrating control and balance. The question evaluates whether this pose is accurately represented.
Question: Is there a panel showing the figure mid-air with knees tucked tightly, labeled as "Step 3: Mid-Air Adjustment: Tuck knees tightly"?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The design aesthetic calls for bold outlines, vibrant colors focused on blues and whites, and energetic fonts for captions. These are observable features: thick black outlines, dominant blue and white color scheme, and stylized text. The question assesses whether these stylistic elements are present across the entire infographic.
Question: Are the illustrations rendered with bold outlines, vibrant blues and whites as dominant colors, and captions written in energetic, stylized fonts?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
