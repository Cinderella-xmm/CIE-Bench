      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the totem pole into a miniature 3D diorama. This implies that the original object should no longer be isolated but part of a contained, three-dimensional scene with depth and scale reduction. A diorama typically includes a bounded environment with depth cues.",
      "question": "Is the totem pole now presented as a miniature scene within a confined space, suggesting a scaled-down 3D environment?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly requires encasing the totem in a cylindrical glass dome. This means a transparent, dome-shaped enclosure must be visible around the entire diorama, with a clear cylindrical shape and reflective or refractive properties consistent with glass.",
      "question": "Is the totem pole enclosed within a transparent cylindrical glass dome?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for a forest-themed setting with tiny ferns and moss at the base. This implies small-scale vegetation (ferns and moss) should be present directly surrounding the base of the totem inside the dome, contributing to a naturalistic ground cover.",
      "question": "Are there tiny ferns and moss visible at the base of the totem pole inside the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies adding a whimsical, animated butterfly perched on top of the totem. This requires a butterfly to be present, positioned on the uppermost part of the structure, and its appearance should suggest animation (e.g., slightly blurred wings, dynamic pose) even if static in the image.",
      "question": "Is there a butterfly perched on the top of the totem pole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction demands an earthy color palette with rich wood textures and green accents. This means the dominant colors should be natural browns and greens, with visible grain in the wood and green hues from plant life, avoiding artificial or bright colors.",
      "question": "Does the image use an earthy color palette dominated by natural browns and greens, with visible wood texture and green plant accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
