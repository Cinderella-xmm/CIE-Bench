      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the image into an Impressionist painting. This implies visible, expressive brushstrokes, soft edges, and a focus on light and color over precise detail. The visual style must resemble works by artists like Monet or Renoir, characterized by loose brushwork and emphasis on atmosphere.",
      "question": "Does the edited image display visible, textured brushstrokes across the entire composition, consistent with Impressionist painting techniques?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies capturing the rhythm of an African tribal ceremony at dusk. This involves both thematic content (ritualistic energy) and temporal context (dusk lighting). Dusk is typically associated with warm, low-light conditions, golden-hour tones, and elongated shadows. The subject’s posture and motion should suggest active participation in a ceremonial act.",
      "question": "Is the scene lit with warm, golden-hour lighting suggestive of dusk, with soft shadows and a glowing horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The attire’s vibrant colors must be enhanced using exaggerated brushstrokes. This means the patterns on the clothing should not appear flat or photographic but instead show thick, directional strokes that emphasize color contrast and texture, typical of painted fabric representation in Impressionism.",
      "question": "Are the patterns and colors of the subject’s clothing rendered with thick, visible brushstrokes that exaggerate their vibrancy and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The background must be blurred into warm golden hues to evoke the atmosphere of dusk and align with the Impressionist aesthetic. A sharp or detailed landscape would contradict this requirement. Warm golden tones include shades of amber, ochre, and burnt orange.",
      "question": "Is the background composed of soft, blended warm golden hues with no distinct details, creating a hazy, atmospheric effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The drum’s texture must be depicted with tactile, layered paint, meaning it should not look like a photograph but rather like physical layers of paint applied to convey depth and surface roughness. This includes visible stroke marks, varying thickness, and implied materiality.",
      "question": "Does the drum surface show layered, textured paint application that gives it a three-dimensional, tactile appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Stylized grass and trees must be present as dynamic elements echoing the subject’s rhythmic movement. This means vegetation should not be static or naturalistic but instead appear swaying or flowing in a way that visually connects to the drummer’s motion—possibly through curved lines, motion blur, or angular forms suggesting vibration.",
      "question": "Are the grass and trees in the background stylized with flowing or angular forms that visually mirror the rhythmic motion of the drummer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
