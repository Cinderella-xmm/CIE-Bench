Q1:
Thinking process: To confirm whether the image was transformed into an “Extreme Sports Series” card illustration, we need to ensure the presence of visual elements commonly associated with extreme sports such as skateboarding, snowboarding, rock climbing, etc. These elements would indicate compliance with the theme.
Question: Does the edited image depict elements from extreme sports?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The retention of the person’s jumping pose is crucial for adhering to the instructions. This means observing if the person depicted is indeed captured mid-air or in a dynamic pose as if performing a jump.
Question: Is the person in the edited image shown in a jumping pose?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The bold outline hand-drawn style involves checking if the outlines around the person and other objects in the illustration appear thick, pronounced, and have a hand-drawn quality rather than a clean digital edge.
Question: Does the image feature bold outlines giving it a hand-drawn appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The requirement for abstract graffiti in the background entails looking for artistic elements like vibrant, stylized patterns, or symbolic graffiti art that contrasts with the concrete texture. We need to verify if these elements exist alongside the intended textures.
Question: Are abstract graffiti elements visible within the background of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Concrete texture implies that the background should have a raw, rough, and realistic concrete surface. This should be visually distinct and identifiable when observing the backdrop.
Question: Does the background incorporate a concrete texture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
