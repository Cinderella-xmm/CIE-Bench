Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the elderly gentleman must be in cartoon form. This implies a stylized, non-realistic rendering with exaggerated features, smooth lines, and simplified details typical of cartoon art. The character should not retain photorealistic textures or proportions.
Question: Is the elderly gentleman depicted in a cartoon style with simplified features and exaggerated proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The newspaper is described as "oversized," which means it should appear significantly larger than normal in proportion to the character's body, particularly compared to how it appears in the original photo. This change must be visually apparent.
Question: Is the newspaper visibly larger than normal in size relative to the gentleman’s body?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The text on the newspaper must be replaced with whimsical, illustrated news. This means the original text should be removed and replaced with drawings or playful imagery representing news stories (e.g., cartoon animals, exaggerated headlines, or fantasy scenes), not just blank space or real text.
Question: Are the newspaper pages filled with illustrated, whimsical content instead of readable text?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A blank thought bubble is explicitly required for personalization. It should be clearly visible near the gentleman, unconnected to any speech or narrative, and left empty so users can add their own message.
Question: Is there a blank, unpopulated thought bubble present near the gentleman?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The background must be transformed into simplified, lush park graphics. This means realistic elements like detailed trees and grass should be replaced with stylized, cartoon-like versions—using clean shapes, minimal detail, and soft colors.
Question: Does the background consist of simplified, stylized park elements such as cartoon trees, grass, and flowers rather than realistic ones?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Soft pastel accents are required to emphasize tranquility. This refers to the use of muted, gentle colors like light blues, pinks, greens, and yellows, avoiding strong contrasts or saturated hues.
Question: Are soft pastel colors used throughout the image, especially in the background and clothing, contributing to a calm atmosphere?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The image is intended to be printed on textured cardstock. While texture cannot always be physically felt in digital images, it should be visually suggested through subtle surface patterns, paper grain effects, or embossed-like finishes.
Question: Does the image display a visible textured surface resembling cardstock, such as paper grain or subtle embossing?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
