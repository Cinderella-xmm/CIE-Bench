Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating an infographic with a title. This requires the presence of a clearly visible text element at the top or prominent position of the image stating 'The Evolution of Strength through Time'. The title must be legible and stylistically integrated into the overall design.
Question: Is the title 'The Evolution of Strength through Time' present and clearly visible in the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the character into three distinct historical figures. Each transformation must be visually separate and identifiable by era-specific attire and posture. The character must appear in three different forms: Ancient Greek wrestler, knight, and Olympic weightlifter.
Question: Are there three distinct representations of the character corresponding to Antiquity, Feudal Era, and Modern Era?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: For the Antiquity depiction, the character must wear mythological armor typical of Ancient Greece, such as greaves, a cuirass, and possibly a helmet or laurel wreath. The posture should reflect wrestling or combat readiness.
Question: Does the Antiquity version of the character include mythological armor characteristic of Ancient Greek warriors or wrestlers?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The Feudal Era transformation must feature heavy plate armor and a large sword. The armor should resemble medieval European knight gear, including articulated limbs, a breastplate, and possibly a helmet. The character must be holding a sword.
Question: Does the Feudal Era version of the character wear heavy plate armor and hold a large sword?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The Modern Era depiction must show the character as an Olympic weightlifter, wearing athletic attire such as a singlet and lifting shoes, with a barbell positioned across the shoulders in a clean or snatch stance.
Question: Does the Modern Era version of the character wear athletic gear and have a barbell across the shoulders in a weightlifting pose?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states that the head must remain consistent across all transformations. This means the facial features, expression, hairstyle, and general head shape should not change from one era to another, even if the body and clothing do.
Question: Is the character’s head, including facial features and expression, identical across all three historical depictions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The instruction emphasizes intricate distinctions in attire and posture. This implies that each era’s costume and stance should be detailed and historically accurate, not generic or simplified.
Question: Are the attire and posture in each era depicted with sufficient detail to distinguish them as representative of their respective time periods?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
