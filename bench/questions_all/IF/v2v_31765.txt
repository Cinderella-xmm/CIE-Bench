Q1:
Thinking process: Cubist art typically involves breaking down objects into geometric shapes. We need to verify if the vegetables and knife have been decomposed into such shapes.
Question: Have the vegetables and knife been broken down into geometric shapes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: In Cubism, these geometric shapes are often rearranged in an abstract way, creating a fragmented appearance. We need to check if this rearrangement is present.
Question: Are the geometric shapes rearranged in an abstract manner?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: While abstract, Cubist works still maintain some recognizable elements of the original objects so that they can be identified. We need to ensure the vegetables and knife remain identifiable.
Question: Are the vegetables and knife still recognizable despite being abstracted?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Cubist artworks often employ a limited color palette, focusing more on form than color. We need to confirm if the colors have been simplified accordingly.
Question: Has the color palette been simplified to align with Cubist style?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Cubism frequently uses overlapping planes and multiple perspectives within a single composition. We need to check if these features are evident in the edited image.
Question: Does the image show overlapping planes and multiple perspectives characteristic of Cubism?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
