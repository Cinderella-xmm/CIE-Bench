Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the medieval structure into a colossal stone golem. This implies that the architectural form must be reinterpreted as a humanoid figure made of stone, with structural elements like towers and arches forming parts of the body. The presence of limbs and a head-like structure must be evident.
Question: Does the edited image depict the medieval structure as a colossal stone golem with a humanoid form?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The archways are explicitly instructed to function as articulated limbs. This means they should appear as arms or legs, possibly bent or positioned in a way that suggests movement or joint articulation, rather than static architectural features.
Question: Are the archways visibly transformed into articulated limbs resembling arms or legs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The battlements are to serve as a crown. This requires the crenellated top of the tower to be stylized or reshaped to resemble a regal or ornate crown, possibly with elevated points or symbolic design elements suggesting royalty or power.
Question: Do the battlements at the top of the structure resemble a crown-like shape?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The surface of the structure must now feature glowing ancient glyphs instead of the original brick texture. This implies visible inscriptions across the stone surface, emitting light, and replacing the natural masonry pattern entirely.
Question: Are glowing ancient glyphs visible across the surface of the structure, replacing the original wall texture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The figure must be silhouetted against the sky, meaning it should be darkened or outlined sharply against a lighter background (the sky), creating a strong contrast. Additionally, previously shadowed areas should emit a mystical auraâ€”suggesting a soft glow or radiance around dark regions.
Question: Is the stone golem silhouetted against the sky with a mystical aura emanating from its shadowed areas?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The small human figure in the original image must be transformed into a luminous guide wisp. This involves changing its appearance to something non-corporeal, glowing, and possibly translucent, resembling a spirit or magical entity.
Question: Has the small human figure been replaced by a luminous, ethereal wisp-like entity?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for adding "ethereal charm," which can be interpreted through visual cues such as soft glows, floating particles, subtle light trails, or other magical effects that enhance the mystical atmosphere.
Question: Are there visible ethereal effects such as soft glows, light particles, or magical ambiance added to the scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
