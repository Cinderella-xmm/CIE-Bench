    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the entire bottle into a LEGO structure. This requires that every part of the original bottle—body, cap, label—is constructed from LEGO bricks rather than being a realistic depiction. The transformation must be fully structural and not just stylistic.",
      "question": "Is the entire bottle constructed entirely from LEGO bricks, with no realistic glass or plastic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly states that the glass body should be made from translucent green bricks. This implies that the color and transparency properties of the original bottle must be replicated using LEGO materials, specifically translucent green bricks to mimic the light-green hue of the liquid and bottle.",
      "question": "Are the body and sides of the bottle built using translucent green LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The label design is specified to use multicolored blocks. Since the original label contains multiple colors (black, red, green, gold), these must be recreated using different colored LEGO blocks to represent the same visual information in a blocky format.",
      "question": "Is the label area composed of multicolored LEGO blocks representing the original design elements (logo, text, colors)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The cap must be constructed from smooth, circular blue bricks while maintaining its cylindrical form. This means the top of the bottle should resemble the original screw-cap shape but be made from blue LEGO pieces with a smooth surface and circular cross-section.",
      "question": "Is the cap made from smooth, circular blue LEGO bricks and does it maintain a cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires placing the LEGO bottle on a minimalist white shelf to emphasize its sculptural qualities. This means the background must be plain, and the shelf must be simple and white, providing contrast and focus on the LEGO structure.",
      "question": "Is the LEGO bottle placed on a minimalist white shelf against a neutral or white background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "All brand details must be legibly reimagined with blocky text. This includes the Bacardi logo, \"Mojito,\" \"Classic Cocktails,\" \"Facundo Bacardí,\" and other textual elements. These must be readable despite being constructed from LEGO bricks, meaning letters should be clearly formed and spaced.",
      "question": "Are all brand texts (e.g., \"Bacardi,\" \"Mojito,\" \"Classic Cocktails\") visibly rendered in blocky LEGO-style lettering and legible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes highlighting the sculptural attributes. This implies that the LEGO structure should have defined edges, depth, and three-dimensionality, allowing viewers to perceive it as a physical object with form and texture.",
      "question": "Does the LEGO bottle display clear sculptural features such as defined edges, depth, and 3D form to emphasize its construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
