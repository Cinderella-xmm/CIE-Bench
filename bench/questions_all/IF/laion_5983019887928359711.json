      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the individual into a Baroque-style cartoon character with exaggerated features. This implies a shift from realistic portraiture to a stylized, animated form with pronounced proportions and expressive traits typical of cartoon interpretations of historical figures. The term \"Baroque-style\" suggests dramatic flair, ornamental detail, and dynamic composition, which should be evident in facial features, clothing, and pose.",
      "question": "Has the individual been transformed into a cartoon character with exaggerated facial features such as oversized eyes, elongated nose, or enlarged head relative to body?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly mentions \"large, intricately styled hair rendered with elegant curls.\" This requires not only volume and curling but also decorative styling consistent with Baroque fashion—such as powdered wigs with tight ringlets and height. The hair must appear more elaborate than in the original image.",
      "question": "Is the hair significantly larger and composed of numerous elegant, tightly curled sections that extend beyond the natural shape seen in the original?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The costume is described as an ornate red coat with golden embroidery. This means the red garment must be clearly visible, rich in color, and decorated with gold patterns resembling floral or scroll motifs typical of Baroque design. The embroidery should be prominent and detailed.",
      "question": "Does the red coat feature visible golden embroidery in ornate, decorative patterns such as scrolls, flowers, or flourishes?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "A \"striking blue sash\" is specified, indicating a wide, vividly colored band draped diagonally across the torso. It should contrast sharply with the red coat and be positioned in a manner consistent with ceremonial attire of the period, likely from shoulder to hip.",
      "question": "Is there a wide, vibrant blue sash diagonally crossing the torso from one shoulder to the opposite hip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for a \"detailed 3D figurine\" with \"polished, smooth textures,\" implying that the surface of the character should have a glossy, sculptural quality—like porcelain or resin—rather than a flat painted appearance. This includes subtle highlights, reflections, and uniform texture across skin, fabric, and accessories.",
      "question": "Does the character exhibit a polished, smooth surface texture with reflective highlights suggesting a 3D figurine-like finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The background is required to be \"muted, gradient\" to emphasize the character’s historical charm without distraction. This means the background should lack sharp details or bright colors, transitioning smoothly between soft tones (e.g., gray to blue or brown to purple).",
      "question": "Is the background a smooth gradient of muted colors without distinct objects or patterns?",
