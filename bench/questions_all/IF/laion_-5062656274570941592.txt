Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the figures should be crafted from fine porcelain with a glossy finish. This implies a smooth, reflective surface distinct from wood or matte materials. Porcelain is typically white or off-white with a polished appearance, so the material and texture must visibly differ from the original wooden cutout style.
Question: Are the figures made of a smooth, glossy material consistent with fine porcelain?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires intricate gold leaf elaborations on garments and halos. Gold leaf is thin, metallic, and reflective, often applied in detailed patterns. These details should be visible on clothing and halo outlines.
Question: Are there visible gold leaf embellishments on the garments and halos of the figures?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The original wooden stable must be replaced with an ornate marble grotto. Marble has a characteristic veined texture and is typically polished. The structure should no longer resemble wood but instead display stone-like qualities with decorative elements such as columns or arches.
Question: Has the wooden structure been replaced with a marble-like grotto featuring polished stone texture and architectural details?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies engraved motifs on the columns and base of the grotto. These would be carved or etched designs, possibly floral, geometric, or religious symbols, visible on structural elements like pillars or the foundation.
Question: Are there engraved decorative motifs visible on the columns and base of the grotto?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for luxurious packaging with velvet lining and elegant branding on the exterior. This means the entire scene should be enclosed in a box with soft, dark fabric (velvet) inside and a refined label or logo on the outside.
Question: Is the nativity scene presented within a box that has velvet lining and visible elegant branding on the exterior?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
