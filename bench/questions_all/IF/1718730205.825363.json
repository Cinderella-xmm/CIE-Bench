      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the entire scene into a stained glass window style. This implies that both the cosmic vortex and the forest landscape must be rendered as if made of colored glass panels, with defined borders and translucency typical of stained glass art.",
      "question": "Is the entire image, including the cosmic vortex and forest landscape, rendered in the style of a stained glass window?",

      "thinking_process": "\"Outline the spiral in bold leadwork\" refers to the use of dark, thick lines resembling lead cames used in traditional stained glass to separate colored panes. These lines should follow the spiral structure of the cosmic vortex.",
      "question": "Are the spiral patterns of the cosmic vortex outlined with thick, dark, continuous lines resembling lead cames?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "\"Use rich jewel tones for the sky and trees\" means the colors should be deep, saturated, and reminiscent of gemstones such as sapphire, amethyst, emerald, or ruby. This applies to both the sky (cosmic elements) and the foliage.",
      "question": "Are the sky and tree canopies depicted using deep, saturated colors such as deep blues, purples, reds, and greens characteristic of jewel tones?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "\"Add faceted glass textures to mimic light refraction\" implies that the surface of the glass should show angular, crystalline patterns that simulate how light bends and scatters through real glass. This should be visible across the stained glass elements.",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the stained glass elements (including the spiral and trees) exhibit angular, multi-faceted textures that simulate light refraction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "\"Convey ethereal tranquility\" is an emotional goal, which can be achieved through soft lighting, harmonious color blending, balanced composition, and glowing effects typical of spiritual or serene imagery. In stained glass context, this may include luminous edges, gentle gradients, and lack of harsh contrasts.",
      "question": "Does the image feature soft, glowing light effects, smooth color transitions, and balanced composition that evoke a sense of calm and serenity?",
