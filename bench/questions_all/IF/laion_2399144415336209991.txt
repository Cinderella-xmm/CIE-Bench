Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires cartoonizing the couple, which implies stylized features such as exaggerated proportions, simplified lines, and non-realistic rendering. This includes visible distortions from photorealism, such as oversized heads or limbs, bold outlines, and flat colors typical of cartoon art.
Question: Is the couple depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated facial features and proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The bride’s gown has intricate beadwork in the original image. The instruction specifies enhancing this detail, meaning the beads should appear more prominent, denser, or stylized in a way that draws attention—such as glowing, larger, or more ornate patterns—consistent with cartoon exaggeration.
Question: Has the beadwork on the bride’s gown been enhanced to appear more elaborate or exaggerated than in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The groom’s suit lapel must be enlarged as part of the cartoonization. This means the lapel should visibly extend beyond normal proportions, appearing wider or longer than realistic, consistent with exaggerated cartoon styling.
Question: Has the groom’s suit lapel been enlarged to an exaggerated size compared to its original proportion?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for adding three action presets: holding hands, toasting, and dancing. These are separate scenes or poses that must be present in the final output, not just one. Each must be clearly identifiable as a distinct pose within the series.
Question: Are there three distinct scenes showing the couple holding hands, toasting, and dancing?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Each scene must be framed in a gold-trimmed, heart-shaped border. This means every individual image (each action preset) must have a border shaped like a heart with a gold outline. This is a structural requirement for each frame.
Question: Is each of the three scenes enclosed in a heart-shaped border with a gold trim?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The frames must be placed on a cream-colored envelope with floral engravings. This means the background of each image must resemble an envelope—cream in color—and include engraved floral patterns, possibly embossed or subtly textured.
Question: Is each framed scene placed on a cream-colored background featuring floral engravings?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
