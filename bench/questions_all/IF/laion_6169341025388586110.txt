Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the statue into a 3D clay model. This implies a change in material appearanceâ€”clay has a matte, textured surface with visible modeling imperfections, unlike the smooth stone of the original. The model should retain the same form but appear as if sculpted from clay.
Question: Is the statue rendered with a matte, textured surface resembling molded clay?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires encasing the statue in a large circular glass dome. This means a transparent spherical or hemispherical structure must fully surround the statue, visible as a boundary between the statue and its environment.
Question: Is the statue enclosed within a large circular glass dome?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The glass dome must rest on a decorative pedestal. This implies a visible, ornate base supporting the dome, likely with carved details or architectural embellishments.
Question: Is the glass dome resting on a decorative pedestal with ornamental design elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Ornate patterns featuring lotus and wave motifs must be added to the glass. These should be visible as etched or embossed designs on the surface of the dome, clearly identifiable as such symbols.
Question: Are there visible ornate patterns on the glass dome, including lotus and wave motifs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Spotlight effects must highlight the trident, snake, and drum, enhancing their golden hues. This means these objects should appear brighter, more reflective, and distinctly golden compared to other parts of the statue.
Question: Are the trident, snake, and drum illuminated by spotlights that emphasize their golden color?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The muscular contours of the statue must be accentuated with intricate shadowing. This implies enhanced contrast and depth in the muscles, achieved through detailed shading and lighting techniques.
Question: Are the muscular contours of the statue emphasized with detailed and intricate shadowing?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: Small incense holders must be placed around the base of the structure. These should be visible as miniature containers, likely with incense sticks or smoke, positioned at the edge of the pedestal.
Question: Are small incense holders visible around the base of the pedestal?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
