    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the entire ensemble into an Art Deco graphic style. This implies the presence of sharp angles, symmetrical compositions, stepped forms, and stylized ornamentation typical of Art Deco design. The visual language should shift from naturalistic to geometric abstraction.",
      "question": "Are the kimono and fox mask rendered with sharp geometric shapes and angular lines characteristic of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly calls for accentuating geometric shapes and bold lines. This means that any organic or soft contours in the original image (e.g., curved edges of the kimono or mask) must be replaced with straight lines, zigzags, or angular forms.",
      "question": "Do the outlines and internal details of both the kimono and the fox mask feature prominent bold lines and angular geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The floral patterns on the kimono must be simplified into stylized motifs, meaning they should no longer resemble natural flowers but instead be reduced to abstract, repeating geometric or symmetrical forms consistent with Art Deco aesthetics.",
      "question": "Have the floral patterns on the kimono been replaced with simplified, abstract, and stylized motifs rather than realistic flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The specified color palette includes deep reds, pale pinks, and metallics. These colors must dominate the image and be used consistently across both the kimono and mask to reflect the luxurious and elegant qualities of Art Deco.",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image deep reds, pale pinks, and metallic tones (such as silver or gold)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes symmetry and elegance, which are core principles of Art Deco. This means the composition should be balanced, with mirrored elements, and the textures should appear refined and cohesive—avoiding clutter or asymmetry.",
      "question": "Is the overall composition symmetrically balanced, with harmonious alignment between the kimono and mask, and do the textures appear refined and unified?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires harmony in silhouette and texture. This means that while the style changes, the general shape and proportion of the kimono and mask must remain recognizable and proportional to the original figure, without distortion.",
      "question": "Are the silhouette and proportions of the person’s body, kimono, and mask preserved and harmonized despite the stylistic transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
