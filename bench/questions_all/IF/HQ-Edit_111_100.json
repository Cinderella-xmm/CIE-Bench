      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the original wooden warrior statue into a LEGO creation. This means the entire figure must be constructed from LEGO bricks, not just resemble one. The material appearance should reflect LEGOâ€™s characteristic blocky, modular structure.",
      "question": "Is the warrior statue composed entirely of LEGO bricks, with visible brick-like elements forming its body, limbs, and head?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies using brown and tan bricks for the body. These colors are typical for LEGO figures representing wood or earth tones. The color palette must match these hues across the entire figure.",
      "question": "Are the primary colors used in the statue limited to shades of brown and tan?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Smooth bricks are specified for armor sections, implying flat, untextured surfaces that mimic polished armor. This contrasts with textured bricks used elsewhere. The distinction between smooth and textured areas must be visually apparent.",
      "question": "Are the armor sections (such as chest plate, shoulder pads, and leg guards) made of smooth LEGO bricks without surface texture?",

      "thinking_process": "Intricate designs and carvings must be represented using textured bricks, which have raised patterns or details. These should be visible in areas like the headdress, neckpiece, and decorative elements.",
      "question": "Are the ornamental details such as the headdress, necklace, and carvings on the torso created using textured LEGO bricks with visible patterns?",

      "thinking_process": "The statue must be placed on a minimalist white pedestal within a gallery setting. This includes clean lines, neutral background, and museum-style lighting. The pedestal should be simple and white, matching standard display practices.",
      "question": "Is the LEGO statue positioned on a plain white pedestal with no decorative elements, located in a gallery environment with framed artworks on the walls and track lighting overhead?",

      "thinking_process": "The original statue's posture and proportions must be preserved. The LEGO version should maintain the same stance, height ratio, and overall silhouette as the original wooden figure.",
      "question": "Does the LEGO statue retain the same standing posture, facial expression, and proportional dimensions as the original wooden warrior?",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The transformation must result in a clearly LEGO-style construction, not a realistic sculpture. This includes visible brick seams, modular joints, and consistent brick shapes.",
      "question": "Is the statue visibly constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, with no continuous surfaces resembling carved wood?",
