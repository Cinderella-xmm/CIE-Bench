Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the saxophone into a fantastical serpent. This requires replacing the instrument's structure with a serpentine form, including a long, coiled body and reptilian features. Metallic scales and intricate engravings are explicitly mentioned, indicating that the surface texture must resemble armor-like or scaly metal with detailed ornamentation.
Question: Is the saxophone transformed into a serpent-like creature with a coiled body and metallic scales?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The keys of the saxophone are to be replaced with shimmering gemstones. This implies that each key should no longer be metallic but instead appear as polished, reflective stones (e.g., rubies, sapphires, emeralds) embedded in the instrument’s body, maintaining their positions but changing material.
Question: Are the original saxophone keys replaced with gemstones that exhibit a shimmering, reflective quality?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The bell of the saxophone is to be morphed into an open maw with sharp, stylized fangs. This means the flared end must now resemble a mouth, with visible teeth—likely pointed and artistically designed—not just organic but stylized, possibly with metallic or glowing edges.
Question: Has the bell of the saxophone been transformed into an open maw featuring sharp, stylized fangs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The neck of the saxophone is to be extended into a coiled body with delicate filigree patterns. This involves lengthening the instrument’s neck into a sinuous, snake-like shape that curls around itself, and the surface must include fine, ornamental metalwork resembling lace or scrollwork.
Question: Does the saxophone’s neck extend into a coiled serpent body decorated with delicate filigree patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The reed is to be modified into a barbed tongue. This requires the mouthpiece’s reed to transform into a protruding, forked or segmented tongue with barbs, likely made of a dark, metallic or organic-looking material, positioned as if flicking out from the mouth.
Question: Has the reed been transformed into a barbed tongue extending from the serpent’s maw?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The red velvet cushion remains part of the scene and serves as the base. It must still be present beneath the transformed creature, maintaining its color, texture, and position relative to the subject.
Question: Is the saxophone/serpent resting on a red velvet cushion identical in appearance to the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The lighting in the original image is dramatic, with a spotlight effect from above. The instruction does not mention altering lighting, so it should remain consistent—focused on the subject, creating highlights and shadows that emphasize the new details.
Question: Is the lighting still focused on the central subject, producing a spotlight effect similar to the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
