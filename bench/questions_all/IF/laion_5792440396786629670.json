    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the site map into a whimsical children's treasure map. This implies that the overall aesthetic must shift from professional/sterile to playful and imaginative. Key indicators include cartoonish or hand-drawn elements, thematic consistency (like pirate maps), and absence of corporate design language.",
      "question": "Does the edited image use a whimsical, playful visual style consistent with a children's treasure map?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly states replacing page names with fun icons, such as a castle for the Homepage. This means each main section should be represented by an icon rather than text labels. The presence of recognizable symbols like castles, treasure chests, or ships would fulfill this requirement.",
      "question": "Are all major sections (e.g., Homepage, Products & Solutions) represented by fun, thematic icons instead of text labels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The original straight lines connecting nodes must be replaced with winding journey trails to reflect a treasure map’s path-like navigation. These trails should not be straight or geometric but curved and organic in shape, resembling roads or rivers on a fantasy map.",
      "question": "Are the connections between sections represented by winding, non-linear journey trails instead of straight lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies adding imaginative decorative elements such as colorful trees and mystical creatures along the paths. These elements must be visible and integrated into the layout, enhancing the magical, adventurous feel of the map.",
      "question": "Are there visible decorative elements such as colorful trees, mystical creatures, or other fantasy-themed illustrations placed along the paths or around the map?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for bold, child-friendly colors and dynamic, storybook-style fonts. This means the color palette should include bright, saturated hues (e.g., reds, blues, yellows), and text should be stylized with rounded, exaggerated letterforms typical of children’s books.",
      "question": "Are the colors used in the image bold and vibrant, and is the text rendered in a dynamic, storybook-style font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "While the visual style changes significantly, the underlying structure of the site map must remain intact—hierarchy and relationships between pages should still be clear. This ensures functionality is preserved under the playful design.",
      "question": "Is the hierarchical structure of the original site map preserved despite the transformation into a treasure map style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
