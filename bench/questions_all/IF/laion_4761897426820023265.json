      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies creating a miniature 3D model of the Great Wall and surrounding mountains. This implies a scaled-down, three-dimensional representation that maintains recognizable structural features such as the wall’s winding path and mountain contours. The model should not be life-size or realistic but stylized and reduced in scale.",
      "question": "Is the Great Wall and surrounding mountains rendered as a miniature 3D model rather than a full-scale photograph?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires encasing the entire scene in a crystal-clear snow globe. This means the model must be fully enclosed within a transparent spherical container, visible from the outside, with reflections or refractions consistent with glass or acrylic material.",
      "question": "Is the miniature model of the Great Wall and mountains enclosed within a transparent, spherical snow globe?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for tiny, detailed figures walking the Wall. These figures must be significantly smaller than the original human scale and still show discernible clothing, posture, or movement details to qualify as “detailed.”",
      "question": "Are there small-scale human figures depicted walking along the Great Wall inside the snow globe, with visible details such as clothing or accessories?",

      "question": "Are areas of the landscape inside the snow globe adorned with bright autumn-colored foliage (e.g., red, orange, yellow leaves)?",
