      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires the creation of an educational infographic with a specific title. This means the image must now include a visible title text that reads \"Journey to Space\" in a prominent position, likely at the top or center of the composition. The presence of this exact title is essential to satisfy the requirement.",
      "question": "Is the title \"Journey to Space\" clearly displayed in the edited image?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The original astronaut image must remain as the central visual element. This implies that the astronaut figure should be positioned prominently in the center of the composition and not obscured or replaced by other elements. The integrity of the astronaut's pose and suit details should be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the astronaut figure still present and positioned centrally in the edited image?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The background environment must be transformed from a workshop-like room into a mission control center. This involves replacing or overlaying the existing cluttered workspace with visual elements such as control panels, monitors, screens, and possibly personnel in uniforms, consistent with a space mission control setting.",
      "question": "Has the background been transformed into a mission control center with elements like control panels, screens, or consoles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies adding illustrative icons for key training stages. These icons should be visually distinct and placed around the astronaut or within the layout, representing stages like Physical Training, Technical Skills, Simulators, and Space Suit Check. Each icon should be recognizable and associated with its respective stage.",
      "question": "Are there four distinct illustrative icons present, each representing one of the following: Physical Training, Technical Skills, Simulators, and Space Suit Check?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The design must feature vibrant color-coded sections for each training stage. This means that each of the four stages should be assigned a unique, bright color (e.g., blue for Physical Training, green for Technical Skills, etc.), and these colors should be used consistently across labels, backgrounds, or borders of their respective sections.",
      "question": "Are the four training stages represented in distinct, vibrant color-coded sections (e.g., different colored backgrounds or labels)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Clean, modern typography is required to explain each training stage. This implies the use of legible, sans-serif fonts, consistent sizing, and proper alignment for all text elements explaining the stages. The text should be readable and integrated into the design without clutter.",
      "question": "Is the text describing each training stage written in clean, modern typography (e.g., sans-serif font, consistent style)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall design must be cohesive and informative, highlighting the significance of each training step. This means the layout should logically connect the astronaut to the training stages, with clear visual hierarchy, balanced spacing, and thematic consistency (e.g., space-related imagery, NASA branding if applicable).",
      "question": "Does the overall design appear cohesive and informative, with a logical flow connecting the astronaut to the training stages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
