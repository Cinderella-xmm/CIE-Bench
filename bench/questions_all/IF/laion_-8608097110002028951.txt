- Convert the theater building into a LEGO model using tan bricks for the facade with brown accents
- Replace the windows with translucent square LEGO pieces
- Replace the marquee signs with smooth red flat bricks for lettering
- Transform the vintage cars into blocky LEGO vehicles in black and purple
- Create a playful, miniature street scene overall
- Maintain the architectural structure and layout of the original building
- Ensure all elements (building, cars, signage) are stylized consistently in LEGO form

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies converting the entire theater building into a LEGO model using tan bricks for the facade and brown accents. This implies that the building's surface should visibly resemble LEGO brick construction with distinct block-like textures and coloration. The use of tan as the primary color and brown for decorative or structural details must be clearly observable.
Question: Is the facade of the theater building constructed from visible tan LEGO bricks with brown accents?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The windows are to be replaced with translucent square LEGO pieces. This means the original glass panes should no longer appear realistic but instead look like uniform, grid-like translucent blocks typical of LEGO window elements. The shape and transparency should reflect LEGO-style design.
Question: Are the large arched windows replaced with translucent square LEGO pieces arranged in a grid pattern?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The marquee signs for "Walgreens" and "Marina Theater" must be replaced with smooth red flat LEGO bricks forming the letters. This requires the text to appear as if made from individual red LEGO tiles, not painted or printed signage.
Question: Are the marquee signs for "Walgreens" and "Marina Theater" rendered using smooth red flat LEGO bricks to form the letters?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The vintage cars must be transformed into blocky LEGO vehicles in black and purple. This involves altering their proportions and surfaces to mimic LEGO construction—angular, modular, and non-realistic—with specific colors assigned: one car black, one purple.
Question: Are both vintage cars rendered as blocky LEGO vehicles, one in black and one in purple, with angular, modular features?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The overall scene must be transformed into a playful, miniature LEGO street scene. This includes consistent LEGO styling across all elements—buildings, vehicles, signage—and a sense of scale appropriate to a toy model, avoiding realistic textures or lighting.
Question: Does the entire scene—including the building, cars, and signage—appear as a cohesive, playful, miniature LEGO model with consistent blocky textures and toy-like proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
