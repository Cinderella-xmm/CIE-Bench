A \"yes\" answer would mean the structure now clearly resembles a robot with visible joints, limbs, and mechanical components, not just a stylized version of the original building.",
      "question": "Does the edited image show the building transformed into a giant mechanical golem with visible articulated limbs and exposed gears?",

      "thinking_process": "The windows must be replaced with glowing panels of energy. This implies that the original glass windows are no longer present and have been substituted with luminous surfaces emitting light, likely in a consistent color scheme such as blue, yellow, or white, typical of energy sources in mechanical designs.",
