      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires adding the text 'Stories Through Time' in a specific font style (elegant serif), color (distressed gold), and alignment with the typewriter’s metallic tone. This must be verifiable by checking for presence of the exact phrase, serif typography, gold coloration with texture resembling wear or distress, and proper placement within the composition.",
      "question": "Is the phrase 'Stories Through Time' present in the image using an elegant serif typeface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The color specification includes a \"distressed gold\" appearance that should match the typewriter's metallic finish. This implies both hue similarity and surface texture (e.g., scratches, fading) consistent with aging metal. A plain gold without distress would not meet the requirement.",
      "question": "Is the text 'Stories Through Time' rendered in a distressed gold color that matches the typewriter’s metallic tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The sepia filter is explicitly required to create an aged effect. This means the entire image should have a monochromatic brownish-yellow tint, reducing contrast and shifting colors toward warm, vintage tones. Any areas retaining original vibrant colors would violate this instruction.",
      "question": "Has a sepia filter been applied uniformly across the entire image to create an aged effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies adding \"swirling ghostly pages\" emerging from the typewriter, suggesting semi-transparent, flowing paper-like shapes with motion blur or ethereal glow. These should appear to originate from the typewriter and float outward, symbolizing narrative emergence.",
      "question": "Are there visible swirling, translucent pages emanating from the typewriter, appearing as if stories are emerging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "An Art Deco border is required to frame the image and enhance its refined, nostalgic aesthetic. Art Deco features include geometric patterns, symmetry, stepped lines, and ornamental motifs often in gold or dark contrasting tones. The border must enclose the image and reflect these design characteristics.",
      "question": "Does the image feature a decorative Art Deco-style border framing the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall goal is to transform the image into a \"vintage literary poster\" with emphasis on storytelling. This implies that all added elements (text, color, effects, border) must cohesively support the theme—no modern or incongruous elements should remain. The final composition should feel like a classic promotional poster for literature or writing.",
      "question": "Do all visual elements (text, color scheme, ghostly pages, border) collectively contribute to a cohesive vintage literary poster aesthetic focused on storytelling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
