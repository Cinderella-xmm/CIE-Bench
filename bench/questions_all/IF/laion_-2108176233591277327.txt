Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire cup and saucer into a phoenix egg. This implies a fundamental change in shape and form—no longer resembling a traditional cup and saucer but instead taking on the oval, egg-like silhouette characteristic of a mythical phoenix egg. The structure must be reimagined as a single cohesive egg-shaped object.
Question: Is the cup and saucer combined into a single, oval-shaped object resembling a mythical phoenix egg?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The original floral patterns must evolve into feather-like designs, which means replacing flower motifs with structures that resemble bird feathers—featuring barbs, shafts, and flowing lines typical of avian plumage. These should be vivid and detailed, maintaining the color scheme but shifting in form.
Question: Have the floral patterns been replaced with vibrant, feather-like designs across the surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The handle of the cup must be transformed into an ornate wing. This involves reshaping the handle into a wing-like structure with layered, curved segments resembling feathers or wing bones, possibly with decorative elements such as gold trim or gradient coloring to enhance its ornamental quality.
Question: Has the cup’s handle been reshaped into an ornate wing structure with feathered details?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The saucer’s rim must be altered to resemble a decorative nest, implying a textured, woven appearance with curves and layers mimicking natural twigs or fibers. Additionally, it must include shimmering jewel-like accents—small, reflective elements such as gemstones or iridescent dots embedded along the edge.
Question: Does the saucer’s rim resemble a decorative nest with visible textures and embedded jewel-like accents?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Glowing embers must be embedded within the patterns, suggesting small points of light—possibly orange, red, or golden hues—that appear to emit soft radiance. These should be distributed throughout the design, creating a sense of warmth and mysticism, and should visibly glow against the background.
Question: Are there glowing embers embedded within the patterns, emitting a soft luminous effect?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
