Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the rock arch into a sentient-like stone guardian creature. This implies a shift from a passive geological formation to a figure with implied form and presence—such as facial features, posture, or structural symmetry resembling a being. The transformation must be evident in the overall shape and composition of the arch.
Question: Does the edited image depict the rock arch as a recognizable stone guardian creature with anthropomorphic or guardian-like features?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Crystalline growths are explicitly mentioned and should be visible along the curve of the arch. These should resemble mineral formations such as quartz or geodes, with sharp, geometric facets and possibly reflective surfaces, suggesting otherworldly origin.
Question: Are there visible crystalline structures growing along the curved edges of the arch?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Glowing veins are required to echo natural patterns. This means luminous lines that follow organic or fractal-like paths across the surface of the stone, mimicking biological or geological networks, such as river systems or neural pathways.
Question: Are there luminous, vein-like lines running across the surface of the arch that follow naturalistic branching patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The arch’s outline must be replaced with skeletal, wing-like extensions. This implies that the original smooth arc is now transformed into angular, bony structures resembling wings or limbs, extending outward from the sides or top of the arch.
Question: Has the original arch outline been replaced with skeletal, wing-like protrusions extending from the structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Runic symbols must be present on the inner surface of the arch. These should be stylized, non-linguistic glyphs resembling ancient inscriptions, arranged in meaningful clusters or patterns, possibly glowing or carved deeply into the stone.
Question: Are there clearly visible runic symbols engraved or etched onto the inner surface of the arch?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A radiant orb must serve as the core of ancient energy. This suggests a central point of light, likely located within the arch’s cavity or at its center, emitting a soft glow, possibly with light rays or particles emanating from it.
Question: Is there a glowing orb positioned centrally within the arch, acting as a source of radiance and energy?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
