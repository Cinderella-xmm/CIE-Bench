      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the original ship and seascape into a miniature 3D nautical globe. This implies that the entire scene must be reshaped into a spherical form, where the ship and ocean are curved to fit the surface of a globe. The original flat perspective must be replaced with a spherical projection.",
      "question": "Is the ship and seascape rendered as a spherical 3D globe rather than a flat scene?",
