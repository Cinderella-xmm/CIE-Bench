Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire island village into a whimsical floating island city. This implies that the island is no longer grounded in water but is suspended in the air, with a fantastical and magical appearance. Key indicators include visible levitation, absence of water beneath the island, and a dreamlike atmosphere.
Question: Is the island visibly floating above the water, disconnected from any land or water surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The roofs of the buildings must be transformed into mushroom canopies, meaning they should resemble large mushrooms with caps and stems, likely in organic, rounded shapes with colors typical of mushrooms (e.g., red with white spots, brown, etc.). This transformation replaces the original gabled or flat roofs.
Question: Are all building roofs replaced with mushroom-shaped canopies?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The lake reflection needs to become a shimmering mirage, which implies that the reflection is distorted, glowing, or iridescent, not a clear mirror image. It may include wave-like distortions, light flares, or translucent hues suggesting an illusionary effect.
Question: Does the lake's reflection appear distorted, shimmering, or iridescent rather than a clear mirror image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The mountains in the background must be transformed into towering roots, implying they now resemble massive, gnarled tree roots rising vertically from the ground or water, with textures resembling bark and branching patterns.
Question: Are the mountains in the background morphed into structures resembling giant tree roots?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Vines must connect the houses, indicating visible plant growth forming pathways or links between buildings. These vines should be thick, green, and possibly winding across rooftops or walls.
Question: Are there visible green vines connecting the buildings on the island?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Colorful, ethereal bridges must be introduced between buildings. These bridges should appear translucent, glowing, or made of light or fabric-like materials, with vibrant colors such as pink, blue, or purple, and should span gaps between structures.
Question: Are there colorful, translucent, or glowing bridges connecting the buildings?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The boats must be morphed into leaf-like airships hovering on pastel clouds. This means the boats are no longer on water but are airborne, shaped like leaves, and floating above soft-colored clouds (e.g., pink, lavender, peach).
Question: Are the boats replaced with leaf-shaped airships floating above pastel-colored clouds?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
