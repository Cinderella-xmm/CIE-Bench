      "question": "Has the skate park been replaced with a neon-lit urban environment featuring digital structures and artificial lighting?",

      "question_id": "Q4",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The style must reflect a vibrant, otherworldly illustration with dynamic motion lines. This means the image should have exaggerated motion streaks, bright contrasting colors, and an overall surreal or stylized look typical of sci-fi art.",
      "question": "Does the image feature dynamic motion lines around the skater to emphasize movement and speed?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Although the style changes, the core action—the skater mid-trick—must be preserved. The posture, balance, and position in the air should remain consistent with the original image to maintain continuity of the action.",
      "question": "Has the skater maintained the same mid-air pose and orientation as in the original image?",
