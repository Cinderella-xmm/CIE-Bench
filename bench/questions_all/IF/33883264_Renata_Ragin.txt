- Convert the Brooklyn Bridge into a colossal, stone golem
- Transform the twin spires of the Brooklyn Bridge into its arms
- Use the bridge's cables as sinewy tendons wrapped around its broad chest
- Transform the Freedom Tower into a tall, crystalline crown on the golem's head
- Transform surrounding skyscrapers into intricate armor plating on the golem's body
- Impose a majestic, looming stance with the golem firmly anchored amid the cityscape

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the Brooklyn Bridge into a colossal stone golem. This implies that the entire structure must be reimagined as a humanoid figure made of stone, maintaining recognizable elements of the bridge but repurposed into anatomical features. The transformation should not leave the bridge as a standalone structure.
Question: Has the Brooklyn Bridge been transformed into a colossal, humanoid stone golem?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The twin towers (spires) of the Brooklyn Bridge are explicitly stated to become the golem’s arms. This means they must extend upward and outward in an arm-like configuration, no longer functioning as vertical supports but as limbs.
Question: Have the twin spires of the Brooklyn Bridge been reshaped into arms extending from the golem's shoulders?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The cables of the bridge are described as "sinewy tendons" wrapped around the chest. This implies the suspension cables must be artistically rendered to resemble organic muscle fibers or tendons, tightly coiled and integrated into the torso area of the golem.
Question: Are the bridge's cables depicted as sinewy tendons wrapped around the golem’s broad chest?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The Freedom Tower is instructed to become a crystalline crown on the golem’s head. This requires the tower to be repositioned atop the golem's head, visually altered to appear like a transparent, faceted crystal structure resembling a crown.
Question: Has the Freedom Tower been transformed into a tall, crystalline crown positioned on the golem's head?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Skyscrapers are to form "intricate armor plating," meaning they must be integrated into the golem’s body as protective, detailed plates—possibly fused or arranged to mimic metal or stone armor. They should not remain isolated buildings.
Question: Have the surrounding skyscrapers been transformed into intricate armor plating covering parts of the golem’s body?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The golem must have a "majestic, looming stance" and be "firmly anchored" in the cityscape. This implies it stands upright, towering over the city, with a stable, grounded posture, possibly with feet embedded in the ground or water.
Question: Does the golem stand in a majestic, upright, and firmly anchored stance, dominating the cityscape?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
