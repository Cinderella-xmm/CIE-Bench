Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the suitcase into a tall, rectangular glass vessel. This implies a complete structural change from a soft-sided luggage case to a rigid, transparent, and vertically elongated container resembling a perfume bottle. The shape must be upright and geometrically defined, not bulky or rounded like a suitcase.
Question: Is the object now a tall, rectangular glass vessel instead of a soft-sided suitcase?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The retractable handle must be repurposed into a metallic spray nozzle, which is a functional component of a perfume bottle. This means the handle should no longer be extendable but should resemble a sleek, metallic nozzle at the top of the vessel, likely with a trigger mechanism.
Question: Has the retractable handle been transformed into a metallic spray nozzle positioned at the top of the vessel?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The original fabric panels are to be replaced with translucent purple-tinted sections, meaning the material should now appear see-through with a purple hue, simulating glass or acrylic. The color and transparency must align with typical premium perfume bottle aesthetics.
Question: Are the side and front panels now made of translucent purple-tinted material instead of fabric?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Seam details from the original suitcase are to be retained but reinterpreted as embossed linear patterns on the glass surface. These should not be functional zippers or stitching but decorative raised lines that mimic the original seams in a stylized way.
Question: Are the original seam lines preserved as embossed linear patterns on the surface of the vessel?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: An elegant logo must be etched near the top of the vessel, indicating a brand mark integrated into the glass. It should be subtle and refined, consistent with high-end product branding.
Question: Is there an etched logo visible near the top of the vessel?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The wheels must be converted into decorative caps, implying they are no longer functional but serve as ornamental elements, possibly symmetrical and polished, placed at the base to maintain visual balance.
Question: Have the wheels been replaced with decorative caps at the base of the vessel?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
