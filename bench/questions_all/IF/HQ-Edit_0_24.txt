Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires enhancing flowers with vivid, saturated hues and soft, tactile textures. This means the colors of the flowers should be more intense than in the original image, and their surfaces should appear slightly textured or velvety to suggest tactility. Observability includes increased color saturation (e.g., deeper pinks, brighter yellows) and visible surface texture such as fine petal details or slight sheen.
Question: Are the flowers in the image rendered with visibly higher color saturation compared to the original?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that gardening tools should be depicted as antique, metallic items. This implies the tools (such as the shovel and watering can) must have an aged appearance—possibly with tarnished metal, patina, or rust-like effects—and a clearly metallic material rather than plastic or modern finishes.
Question: Do the gardening tools (shovel and watering can) appear to have an antique, metallic finish with signs of aging such as tarnish or patina?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: A subtle vine motif background is required. This means the background behind the main scene should feature faint, decorative vines or climbing plant patterns that do not overpower the image but add a decorative layer. These should be visible upon close inspection but not distract from the central figure or garden.
Question: Is there a faint, decorative vine pattern overlaid on the background of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for a blank header for monthly details. This implies a rectangular space at the top of the image, left empty for text input, positioned above the main scene. It should be clearly distinguishable as a designated area for writing.
Question: Is there a blank rectangular header space at the top of the image intended for monthly details?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The header must be framed with ornate leafy patterns for elegance. This means the border around the blank header should include detailed, decorative foliage designs—such as stylized leaves, vines, or floral elements—that create an elegant frame.
Question: Is the blank header framed by an ornate, decorative border composed of leafy or floral patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
