Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the church into a semi-cartoon style, which implies simplified forms, exaggerated outlines, and possibly flattened shading or stylized textures. This can be verified by observing whether the building’s lines are more rounded, features are simplified, and details are reduced compared to realistic rendering.
Question: Has the church been rendered in a semi-cartoon style with simplified shapes and stylized lines?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Enhanced symmetry means that the left and right sides of the church should mirror each other precisely, including windows, arches, and structural elements. Any asymmetry in the original image (such as slight variations in window placement) should be corrected.
Question: Are the architectural elements of the church perfectly symmetrical on both sides?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Metallic gold accents must be visibly applied to the spires, likely appearing as reflective, luminous gold highlights along the edges or tips of the tower and roof structures. These should contrast with the base color of the church.
Question: Are there visible metallic gold accents applied specifically to the spires and upper parts of the church?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Proportion adjustment for grandeur implies that the church appears larger than life, possibly with an elongated spire, wider base, or elevated perspective to convey majesty. This can be assessed by comparing the scale of the church relative to surrounding elements like trees or vehicles.
Question: Has the proportion of the church been altered to enhance its sense of grandeur and scale?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Celestial-themed backgrounds involve elements such as stars, moons, nebulae, cosmic colors (deep blues, purples, pinks), or floating planets. The background should no longer reflect a real-world sky but a stylized, otherworldly one.
Question: Has the background been replaced with a celestial-themed design featuring elements like stars, galaxies, or cosmic hues?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The final output must include three distinct prints, each framed in matte black. This means the edited image should show three separate versions of the church art, each enclosed in a uniform black frame.
Question: Are there three separate architectural art prints displayed, each within a matte black frame?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The prints must be curated in a trifold album, meaning they are arranged in a triptych format—three panels connected side by side, folded like a brochure. This layout is observable in how the images are grouped.
Question: Are the three prints arranged in a trifold album format, with a central fold and two outer panels?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
