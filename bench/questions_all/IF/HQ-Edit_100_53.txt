- Transform the image into a traditional Japanese woodblock print style
- Depict a graceful figure in an ornate kimono with bold outlines and flat colors
- Stylize the cherry blossoms with simplified forms and muted pinks
- Rework the path and poles with textured patterns reflecting an Edo-period aesthetic
- Modify the background to mirror classic ukiyo-e landscapes with distant rolling hills
- Ensure all elements maintain the visual characteristics of ukiyo-e art (e.g., strong lines, flat planes, minimal shading)

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the image into a traditional Japanese woodblock print. This implies the use of characteristic features such as bold black outlines, flat areas of color without gradients, and stylized composition typical of ukiyo-e prints. These are observable traits that can be evaluated directly.
Question: Does the edited image feature bold black outlines around figures and objects?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the kimono should have bold outlines and flat colors. This means the garment should not display realistic shading or texture but instead show solid, distinct color blocks separated by clear lines, consistent with woodblock printing techniques.
Question: Are the colors on the kimono flat and uniform without gradients or realistic shading?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Cherry blossoms must be stylized with simplified forms and muted pinks. This means the flowers should not be detailed or photorealistic but rather reduced to basic shapes and softer, less saturated pink tones, aligning with ukiyo-e floral representation.
Question: Are the cherry blossoms depicted with simplified shapes and muted pink hues rather than vibrant or detailed rendering?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The path and poles must be reworked with textured patterns reflective of Edo-period aesthetics. This implies the use of hand-drawn textures, possibly resembling wood grain or carved patterns, rather than smooth modern surfaces.
Question: Do the path stones and poles feature visible textured patterns resembling hand-carved or woodblock-style designs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The background should reflect classic ukiyo-e landscapes with distant rolling hills. This includes layered mountain silhouettes, soft horizon lines, and atmospheric perspective typical of Edo-era landscape prints.
Question: Does the background include stylized distant rolling hills rendered in a manner consistent with traditional ukiyo-e landscape compositions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
