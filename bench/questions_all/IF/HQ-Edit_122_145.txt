Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the original figure into a chibi-style character. Chibi style is characterized by an oversized head relative to the body, large eyes, simplified facial features, and a small, stylized body. This transformation must be applied to the entire figure, not just partial elements.
Question: Is the figure depicted in a chibi style with an oversized head, large eyes, and simplified proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The floral patterns and bows on the kimono are explicitly instructed to be enhanced with exaggerated and vibrant colors. This means the existing floral designs should be more prominent, saturated, and possibly larger or more numerous than in the original image.
Question: Are the floral patterns and bows on the kimono significantly more vibrant and exaggerated in color and size compared to the original?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating four distinct fridge magnets, each showing the chibi character in a different pose related to spring. These poses must be clearly distinguishable and match the described actions.
Question: Are there exactly four separate images of the chibi character, each in a unique pose corresponding to holding a cherry blossom branch, catching petals, gazing at blooming trees, and dancing amidst falling flowers?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Each magnet must feature the chibi character in one of the specified spring-themed poses. The poses must be clearly identifiable and not ambiguous in their action or context.
Question: Does each of the four images depict a clear and distinct action—holding a branch, catching petals, gazing at trees, or dancing—with visible movement or interaction with cherry blossoms?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The final presentation must show all four magnets arranged on a single pastel-colored magnetic sheet. This implies a unified background with soft, muted tones (e.g., light pink, lavender, mint) and a flat surface suggesting a magnetic backing.
Question: Are the four fridge magnets displayed together on a single pastel-colored surface that appears to be a magnetic sheet?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
