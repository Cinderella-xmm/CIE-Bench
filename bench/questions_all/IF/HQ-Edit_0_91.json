      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies a \"semi-cartoon style,\" which implies simplified forms, exaggerated features, and stylized lines compared to photorealism. This includes elements like clean outlines, reduced shading complexity, and possibly expressive facial features or proportions. The presence of cartoon-like rendering should be observable in the overall character depiction.",

      "thinking_process": "\"Highlight textile patterns with gold leaf accents\" means that the intricate floral and decorative patterns on the robe must have visible gold-colored highlights or metallic sheen applied to them, simulating the appearance of real gold leaf. These accents should stand out against the darker fabric background.",

      "question": "Are the hands visibly enlarged compared to their original size in the original image?",

      "thinking_process": "Subtle, hand-drawn floral outlines must extend from the robe into the frame. This means delicate line drawings of flowers or botanical elements should originate from the patterned robe and flow outward into the border area, suggesting continuity between the garment and the frame. These lines should resemble sketch-like or illustrative strokes.",
