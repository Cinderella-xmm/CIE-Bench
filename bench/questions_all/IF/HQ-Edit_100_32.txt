Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the woman into a stylized art postcard with semi-cartoony features. This implies exaggerated facial proportions (e.g., larger eyes, smoother skin, simplified features), softer lines, and a slightly unrealistic or animated aesthetic. These are observable traits that distinguish cartoonish styling from photorealism.
Question: Does the woman exhibit semi-cartoony features such as exaggerated facial proportions, smooth skin, or stylized hair and eyes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The camera must be emphasized through playful enlargement and metallic accents. "Playful enlargement" means the camera appears noticeably larger than realistic scale, while "metallic accents" suggest shiny, reflective surfaces or chrome-like textures on parts of the camera body or lens.
Question: Is the camera visibly enlarged compared to its original size in the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Metallic accents imply visual cues such as reflections, silver or chrome finishes, or glowing highlights on the camera. These should be present on at least part of the camera to satisfy the requirement.
Question: Does the camera feature metallic accents such as reflective surfaces, chrome elements, or shiny textures?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The background must be a pastel color gradient, meaning it should display a soft blend of light, muted colors like pink, blue, yellow, or green, transitioning smoothly without sharp edges or solid blocks.
Question: Is the background composed of a soft, blended gradient using pastel tones?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A decorative border made of abstract camera motifs must surround the image. This includes stylized representations of cameras, lenses, shutters, or film reels arranged in a patterned frame around the subject.
Question: Is there a decorative border surrounding the image composed of abstract camera-related motifs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies leaving a blank area at the bottom for personalization. This means a clear, unobstructed space—free of text, images, or design elements—must exist at the bottom of the image, suitable for adding custom content.
Question: Is there a blank, unoccupied area at the bottom of the image that could be used for personalization?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
