      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the beads into a cohesive serpent creature. This means the individual beads must be reorganized into a continuous, elongated, snake-like form with clear segmentation. The presence of a distinct head, body, and tail structure is essential to satisfy this requirement.",
      "question": "Is the edited image showing a single, continuous serpent-shaped creature composed of the beads instead of loose or clustered beads?",

      "thinking_process": "The red and yellow patterns are explicitly designated for the scales. Since these colors are prominent in the original beads, their use in forming the textured surface of the serpent’s body is critical. The scale pattern should be visible across the body segments.",
      "question": "Are the red and yellow patterns used to create a scaly texture along the body of the serpent?",

      "thinking_process": "The blue circles are specified as iridescent eyes. Therefore, two distinct blue circular features must be present at the head end of the serpent, positioned appropriately to represent eyes, possibly with a glossy or reflective quality to suggest iridescence.",

      "thinking_process": "The black motifs are instructed to be used as intricate tribal markings. These should appear as detailed, decorative patterns on the serpent's body—distinct from the scale patterns—and not just random spots.",
      "question": "Are the black motifs arranged as detailed, tribal-style patterns along the serpent’s body?",

      "thinking_process": "The tail must be designed as a long, wispy charm with dangling, smaller bead-like tips to suggest movement. This implies an elongated, tapering shape at the end of the serpent, ending in small, suspended elements resembling tiny beads.",
      "question": "Does the serpent’s tail extend into a long, thin, flowing form with small, dangling bead-like tips?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes using the existing colors and patterns of the beads (red, yellow, blue, black) without introducing new ones. Thus, all visual elements in the serpent should derive directly from the original bead palette.",
      "question": "Are only the original colors (red, yellow, blue, black) used in the serpent, with no additional or unrelated colors introduced?",
