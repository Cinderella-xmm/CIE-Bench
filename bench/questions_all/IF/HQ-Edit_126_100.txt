Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire house into a mythic treehouse creature, which implies a fundamental shift in form and identity—no longer just a building but a living, fantastical entity. This transformation must be evident in overall shape, texture, and integration with nature.
Question: Does the house appear as a sentient, mythical treehouse creature rather than a conventional dwelling?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The support columns of the original house must be transformed into elaborate wooden legs, suggesting structural reconfiguration where vertical supports resemble limbs or roots, possibly with joints, curvature, or bark-like textures.
Question: Are the vertical support columns replaced with detailed, leg-like wooden structures resembling limbs or roots?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The straw roof must morph into leafy branches, meaning the thatched material should no longer be visible as roofing but instead appear as organic, branching foliage extending outward like a canopy or crown.
Question: Has the straw roof been replaced by an overgrowth of realistic leafy branches forming a natural canopy?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The satellite dish is to become a giant, lidless eye. This means the dish must be reshaped or reinterpreted as a large, open eye—possibly with a pupil-like center, iris texture, and surrounding eyelid-like features, while retaining its position on the structure.
Question: Is the satellite dish transformed into a large, lidless eye with visible iris and pupil features?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The walls must be covered with intricate bark patterns, indicating a texture change from woven bamboo or wood panels to something resembling tree bark—deep grooves, rough surface, natural coloration, and organic irregularities.
Question: Are the exterior walls fully covered with detailed, textured patterns resembling natural tree bark?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Orange blossoms must radiate a soft aura, implying not only the presence of orange flowers but also a glowing or luminous effect around them, suggesting magical or ethereal lighting.
Question: Do the orange blossoms emit a visible soft glow or aura around them?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: Whispering vines must cascade from the structure, indicating long, flexible plant growths hanging down from various parts of the treehouse, possibly with subtle motion or texture suggesting movement or life.
Question: Are there long, trailing vines descending from the treehouse, giving it an organic, flowing appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
