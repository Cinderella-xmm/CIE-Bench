      "thinking_process": "The overall aesthetic must evoke elegance and luxury appropriate for a retail setting. Observable features include high-gloss finishes, clean lines, refined materials (gold, glass), and absence of clutter.

      "thinking_process": "The presence of a reflective surface beneath the objects suggests a polished retail environment. The reflection should mirror the objects clearly, indicating a glossy floor or display platform typical of luxury stores.",
      "question": "Is there a reflective surface beneath the objects showing clear reflections of the perfume bottles and central façade?",
