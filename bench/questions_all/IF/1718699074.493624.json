      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the central structure into a futuristic digital billboard. This implies replacing the current static head sculpture with a digital display surface, likely featuring illuminated panels and animated content. A key observable feature is whether the surface now displays light-emitting elements or moving visuals instead of a solid, non-luminous form.",
      "question": "Has the central structure been replaced with a digital billboard featuring luminous panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies incorporating dynamic neon animations. This means the digital billboard must include visible motion or changing patterns of light, such as scrolling text, shifting colors, or abstract visual effects typical of digital displays in futuristic settings.",
      "question": "Are there visible dynamic neon animations on the digital billboard surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The overgrowth at the base of the structure must be replaced with synthetic, glow-in-the-dark foliage. This involves removing natural plants and replacing them with artificial vegetation that emits light, typically seen in sci-fi environments. The presence of glowing plant-like forms in place of green grass indicates compliance.",
      "question": "Has the natural overgrowth been replaced with synthetic, glowing foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The architectural angles of the original structure must be maintained. This means that despite the transformation into a digital billboard, the geometric shape and structural lines (e.g., sharp edges, blocky form) should remain consistent with the original sculptureâ€™s silhouette.",
      "question": "Are the original architectural angles and structural geometry preserved in the transformed structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The surrounding buildings need to be refined with contemporary metallic facades and augmented reality features. This includes visible metallic textures, reflective surfaces, and AR elements such as floating holograms, interface overlays, or digital projections on building exteriors.",
      "question": "Do the surrounding buildings feature metallic facades and visible augmented reality elements such as holograms or digital overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
