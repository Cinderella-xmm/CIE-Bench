      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the sock into a sculptural piece made of LEGO bricks. This implies that the entire object must be reimagined as a 3D assembly of LEGO-like blocks, not just textured or painted to resemble them. The material should be visibly composed of individual brick units.",
      "question": "Is the sock fully constructed from visible interlocking LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The original patterns (such as the Under Armour logo, text, and color zones) must be preserved but rendered in a blocky, pixelated style consistent with LEGO bricks. This requires checking whether recognizable design elements are still present but recreated using brick geometry.",
      "question": "Are the original black, gray, and white patterns of the sock retained using blocky LEGO brick shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for layered construction to add depth and a 3D effect. This means the sculpture should have visible layers, varying heights, and structural complexity typical of LEGO models, not flat or smooth surfaces.",
      "question": "Does the sculpture exhibit layered, three-dimensional construction with varying brick heights to create depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The original orange tag at the top of the sock must be replaced with an orange LEGO piece. This is a specific material substitution â€” it must be a distinct LEGO brick element, not just colored orange fabric or paint.",
      "question": "Is the tag at the top of the sculpture an orange LEGO brick piece?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The final presentation must be in a minimalist gallery setting, which implies a neutral background (e.g., white or light gray), soft directional lighting, and no distractions to emphasize the architectural detail. This requires evaluating the environment around the sculpture.",
      "question": "Is the sculpture displayed upright in a clean, minimalist gallery-like environment with no clutter or distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes architectural detail, meaning the LEGO construction should showcase precision, alignment, and intentional design choices that reflect craftsmanship. This includes visible seams, structured geometry, and deliberate placement of bricks.",
      "question": "Does the sculpture display clear architectural detail such as aligned brick rows, defined edges, and intentional structural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
