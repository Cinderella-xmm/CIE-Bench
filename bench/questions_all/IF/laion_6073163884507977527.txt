Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the scene into a miniature diorama enclosed in a glass-domed terrarium. This implies the presence of a transparent dome structure covering the entire scene, which is not present in the original image. The dome should be visible and enclose all elements.
Question: Is there a clear glass dome covering the entire scene, enclosing the house, lake, and surrounding elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies adding mossy green pathways. These should be distinct from the existing ground texture and clearly defined as paths made of green moss material.
Question: Are there visible mossy green pathways leading toward or around the house?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction requires including tiny shrubs. These should be small-scale vegetation placed throughout the scene, especially near the house and along pathways.
Question: Are there multiple tiny shrubs added around the house and along the pathways?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A lake with a shimmering silver surface must be added for contrast. This means a reflective, metallic-looking water body that contrasts with the earthy tones of the house and ground.
Question: Is there a lake with a shiny, silver-colored surface present in the scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Delicate fairy lights are required to be woven around miniature trees, emphasizing woodland elements. These lights should appear as small glowing points or strings wrapped around tree trunks or branches.
Question: Are there delicate fairy lights visible, wrapped around the miniature trees or foliage?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A small bridge must cross the lake and lead directly to the entrance of the house. This implies a structural element spanning the lake with a clear connection to the houseâ€™s doorway.
Question: Is there a small bridge crossing the lake and connecting to the entrance of the house?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
