- Replace the clothing patterns with southwestern fabrics, such as denim and woven textile designs
- Incorporate rustic elements like cacti silhouettes and a setting sun into the wooden background
- Emphasize the band name with a handmade, distressed font
- Add elements such as cowboy boots and hats (beyond what is already present)
- Ensure the overall layout feels cohesive and inviting (through visual harmony of theme, color, and composition)
- Transform the image into a narrative collage-style poster for a country concert
- Infuse a vintage western theme throughout the design

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies replacing clothing patterns with southwestern fabrics like denim and woven textiles. This requires observing whether the original clothing (e.g., floral shirt, white jacket) has been replaced or overlaid with visible textures such as denim weave, geometric patterns, or Southwestern motifs (e.g., Navajo-inspired prints). The change must be visually evident in fabric texture and pattern.
Question: Have the clothing patterns been replaced with southwestern fabrics such as denim or woven textile designs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The background currently features wooden planks with "FGL HOUSE" text. The instruction requires adding rustic elements like cacti silhouettes and a setting sun. These should be visibly integrated into the wooden backdrop—cacti as dark outlines and the sun as a warm-hued circular glow near the horizon line.
Question: Are cacti silhouettes and a setting sun incorporated into the wooden background?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The band name "Florida Georgia Line" must be emphasized using a handmade, distressed font. This implies a non-digital, weathered appearance—possibly with uneven edges, faded areas, or textured strokes resembling hand-painted or stamped lettering. The current text at the bottom is clean and modern; it must be replaced with a style matching this description.
Question: Has the band name been displayed in a handmade, distressed font style?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction mentions adding elements like cowboy boots and hats. While one member already wears a hat, additional elements such as boots (either worn or placed in the scene) or other accessories like lassos or spurs should be added to reinforce the western theme. Their presence must be clearly visible.
Question: Have additional western-themed elements such as cowboy boots or other accessories been added to the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The image must be transformed into a narrative collage-style poster. This means combining multiple visual elements (photos, text, illustrations) in a layered, story-driven format—such as overlapping images, borders, or graphic accents that suggest a montage. The current image is a single photo; the edit must show signs of collage construction (e.g., layered frames, torn paper effects, or illustrated components).
Question: Has the image been transformed into a collage-style layout with layered or composite visual elements suggesting a narrative?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The overall layout must feel cohesive and inviting. Cohesiveness can be evaluated by checking if all elements (colors, fonts, props, background) align with the vintage western theme. Inviting tone may be inferred from warm lighting, balanced composition, and thematic consistency (e.g., no clashing modern elements). The final image should not look disjointed or mismatched.
Question: Does the overall layout maintain a cohesive vintage western theme and appear visually inviting?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
