- Depict the basketball player in a stylized cartoon form with exaggerated movements and dynamic muscles
- Adjust colors to bold neons reflecting the backdrop graffiti
- Include a blank graffiti-style text area on the side for custom messages
- Enhance street art vibrance through visual elements consistent with graffiti aesthetics
- Maintain the core subject (basketball player) and context (basketball court) while transforming style

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the basketball player into a stylized cartoon form. This implies visible exaggeration of physical features such as muscle definition, limb proportions, and motion lines or poses that suggest dynamic movement beyond realism. A cartoon style would include simplified anatomy with enhanced outlines and expressive posture.
Question: Is the basketball player depicted in a stylized cartoon form with exaggerated muscles and dynamic pose?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies adjusting colors to bold neons that reflect the graffiti backdrop. This means the character’s clothing, skin tones, or accessories should incorporate bright, saturated neon hues like electric blue, hot pink, lime green, or cyan—colors commonly associated with urban graffiti art and vibrant street culture.
Question: Are the colors of the basketball player's outfit and/or body adjusted to include bold neon tones matching the graffiti background?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly requires including a blank graffiti-style text area on the side for custom messages. This must be a visible, empty space designed in a graffiti font or style—such as stylized lettering, spray-paint texture, or outlined tags—positioned adjacent to the main image, allowing room for user-added content.
Question: Is there a blank graffiti-style text area present on the side of the image suitable for adding custom messages?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The overall aesthetic must enhance street art vibrance. This includes visual cues like spray-paint textures, angular letterforms, splatter effects, or high-contrast color blocking typical of graffiti art. The transformation should not just change color but also adopt stylistic traits of street art.
Question: Does the edited image feature visual elements such as spray-paint textures, graffiti fonts, or vibrant contrast that enhance the street art vibe?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The core subject—the basketball player—and setting—the outdoor court with hoop and graffiti wall—must remain recognizable despite the stylistic transformation. While the style changes, key elements like the ball, court lines, and hoop should still be identifiable to preserve context.
Question: Is the basketball player clearly identifiable in a basketball setting with a hoop and court, even after the stylistic transformation?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
