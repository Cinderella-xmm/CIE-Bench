- The image has been transformed into a two-panel educational comic format.
- Panel 1 features the bear as an elder forest guide with spectacles and a wise expression, standing in a vibrant forest classroom setting.
- Panel 1 includes a speech bubble with the text: “Ever wondered how a salmon ends up in a bear's mouth?”
- Panel 2 displays the salmon emerging from bubbling water into a transformation chart showing life stages.
- Panel 2 labels the salmon life stages as: ‘egg’, ‘fry’, ‘smolt’, ‘adult’.
- Panel 2 includes a fact box with the text: “Journey's end in the river gives life to the forest.”
- All text uses a clear, modern sans-serif font.
- Natural scenes maintain realistic color fidelity: blue hues for water stages, brown-green for forest background.
- The overall aspect ratio is 16:9.
- Visual clarity and informative flow are preserved across both panels.

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the original image into a two-panel comic. This means the single image must now be divided into two distinct sections (left and right or top and bottom), each serving a specific narrative purpose. The presence of two separate visual panels is essential to meet this requirement.
Question: Is the image split into two distinct panels, one on the left and one on the right (or top and bottom), forming a comic layout?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The bear must be reimagined as an elder forest guide, which implies anthropomorphic traits such as wearing spectacles and displaying a wise facial expression. These elements must be visually present in Panel 1 to satisfy the character transformation requirement.
Question: Does Panel 1 show the bear wearing spectacles and displaying a wise or thoughtful facial expression?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that Panel 1 must include a speech bubble with the exact phrase: “Ever wondered how a salmon ends up in a bear's mouth?” This text must be clearly visible and correctly spelled within a speech bubble attached to the bear.
Question: Is there a speech bubble in Panel 1 containing the text: “Ever wondered how a salmon ends up in a bear's mouth?”
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Panel 2 must depict the salmon emerging from bubbling water and transitioning through a visual chart of its life stages. The chart should clearly show the progression from egg to adult, with each stage labeled. This requires both dynamic motion (bubbling water) and structured labeling.
Question: Does Panel 2 show a salmon emerging from bubbling water into a visual chart with labeled stages: 'egg', 'fry', 'smolt', 'adult'?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction requires a fact box in Panel 2 with the specific text: “Journey's end in the river gives life to the forest.” This must appear as a separate text box, not integrated into the main narrative, and must use the correct wording.
Question: Is there a fact box in Panel 2 containing the text: “Journey's end in the river gives life to the forest.”?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The text throughout the comic must use a clear, modern sans-serif font. This ensures readability and aligns with educational design standards. Observing the font style in all text elements (speech bubble, labels, fact box) is necessary.
Question: Are all text elements (speech bubble, labels, fact box) rendered in a clear, modern sans-serif font?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies maintaining realistic color fidelity, particularly using blue hues for water-related elements and brown-green tones for the forest environment. This means water should appear blue, and the forest background should retain natural earthy and green tones.
Question: Are the water elements in Panel 2 depicted in blue hues and the forest background in Panel 1 shown in brown-green tones?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: The final output must adhere to a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is standard for widescreen formats. This can be verified by comparing the width-to-height ratio of the entire composite image.
Question: Does the overall image have an aspect ratio of 16:9?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q9:
Thinking process: The comic must maintain visual clarity and an informative flow, meaning transitions between panels should be logical, text legible, and imagery coherent. This involves checking whether the content of each panel supports the educational narrative without confusion.
Question: Is the visual content of both panels clear, logically connected, and suitable for educational purposes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
