      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the dancing woman into a stained glass style inspired by Art Nouveau. This implies visible features such as segmented sections resembling glass panes, lead lines between colors, and stylized organic or geometric motifs. The transformation must not alter her pose but express it through this new medium.",
      "question": "Does the dancing woman appear as if made of stained glass with distinct panel-like divisions and dark outlines resembling lead came?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies retaining the woman's dynamic pose and colorful garments. Her posture—mid-leap, one leg raised, arms extended—must be preserved exactly, even as her appearance is stylized. Colorful garments should remain prominent but adapted to the stained glass aesthetic.",
      "question": "Is the woman’s pose identical to the original, with one leg lifted and arms positioned dynamically as in the source image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Art Nouveau is characterized by flowing lines, sinuous curves, and intricate decorative patterns. These should be evident in the woman’s clothing, jewelry, and overall form. Geometric patterning must be integrated with organic flow.",
      "question": "Are the woman’s garments and body adorned with flowing, curvilinear lines and intricate geometric patterns consistent with Art Nouveau design principles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The background village must be reimagined as a dreamlike, serene landscape with curvilinear forms for trees and huts. This includes soft, rounded shapes instead of angular ones, and a shift from realistic to ornamental architecture and nature.",
      "question": "Are the trees and huts in the background redesigned with smooth, curving lines and organic shapes typical of Art Nouveau, rather than naturalistic forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The color palette must shift to a muted, iridescent glass-like tone—suggesting subtle shifts in hue under light, soft gradients, and low saturation, mimicking the appearance of stained glass. Bright primary colors from the original should be subdued.",
      "question": "Is the overall color scheme of the image muted and iridescent, resembling colored glass with soft transitions and low contrast, rather than vibrant, saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Harmonious movement and ornamental detail are central to Art Nouveau. The entire composition should feel unified, with decorative elements flowing across both figure and background, creating a cohesive artistic rhythm.",
      "question": "Does the entire image exhibit a sense of continuous, flowing ornamentation and balanced movement, with decorative details linking the dancer and environment in a unified design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
