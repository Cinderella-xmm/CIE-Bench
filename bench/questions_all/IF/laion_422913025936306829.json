      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the design into a \"vibrant pop art-style mural.\" Pop art is characterized by high contrast, bright colors, and often comic-book-like or graphic qualities. This means the image should not retain its original muted, monochromatic appearance but instead feature saturated, vivid hues and stylized forms.",
      "question": "Does the edited shirt design use vibrant, saturated colors typical of pop art rather than subdued or earthy tones?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "\"Bold color blocks\" implies large, flat areas of solid color used to define shapes and forms, especially on the muscular figure. This is a hallmark of pop art style, contrasting with detailed gradients or shading.",
      "question": "Are large, solid-colored sections used to define the muscular figure’s anatomy, such as chest, arms, and legs, replacing fine shading or gradient effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "\"Sharp geometric lines\" refers to clean, angular, and defined outlines that emphasize structure and form. In pop art, these are often used to separate figures from backgrounds or highlight contours.",
      "question": "Do the edges of the figure and surrounding elements consist of crisp, angular, or straight lines rather than flowing or organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "\"Reimagine the intricate patterns in neon tones\" means that the existing decorative motifs (such as floral or tribal designs) must be transformed into glowing or high-contrast neon colors like electric pink, green, blue, or yellow, typical of neon aesthetics.",
      "question": "Are the previously subtle or gold-toned patterns now rendered in bright, glowing neon colors such as electric blue, hot pink, or lime green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "\"Dynamic, repetitive motifs\" suggests that the design includes repeated visual elements (e.g., stars, dots, zigzags, or abstract shapes) arranged in a rhythmic or energetic pattern across the shirt, enhancing the pop art feel.",
      "question": "Are there recurring, stylized patterns (such as stars, waves, or dots) repeated across the shirt in a consistent and energetic manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies reimagining the design while maintaining the core subject — the muscular figure. Therefore, the pose, proportions, and general silhouette of the figure must remain recognizable despite stylistic changes.",
      "question": "Is the central figure still clearly identifiable as a muscular male figure in a dynamic pose, with arms raised and body angled, even after the stylistic transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
