Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the image into a cartoon-inspired sports card. This implies a shift from photorealism to a stylized, exaggerated illustration style typical of cartoons—such as bold outlines, simplified forms, and expressive motion lines. The key observable feature is whether the visual style has changed to resemble a cartoon or comic book depiction.
Question: Has the image been transformed into a cartoon-inspired illustration style with exaggerated features and bold lines?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies an "exaggerated, dynamic pose with enlarged muscles." This means the player’s physique should be visibly enhanced beyond natural proportions, particularly in muscle definition and limb extension, to emphasize strength and motion.
Question: Are the player’s muscles visibly enlarged and exaggerated compared to realistic proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for "vibrant uniform colors." This refers to the use of highly saturated, eye-catching hues in the player’s uniform, likely more intense than in the original photo. The red and white uniforms should appear brighter and more vivid.
Question: Have the uniform colors been intensified to appear more vibrant and saturated than in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction emphasizes the team's logo on both the helmet and jersey. In the original image, the Washington State Cougars logo is visible on the helmet and jersey. In the edited version, this logo must be clearly highlighted, possibly enlarged or outlined for emphasis in the cartoon style.
Question: Is the team’s logo prominently displayed and emphasized on both the helmet and jersey in the edited image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The background must be stylized to show a roaring crowd and football field, consistent with a sports card aesthetic. This involves replacing the real-world background with a dramatic, animated version featuring silhouettes of fans, motion lines, and a simplified field design.
Question: Has the background been replaced with a stylized depiction of a roaring crowd and football field, consistent with a cartoon sports card?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The final presentation must be a physical collector’s box—specifically, a sleek, matte black box with a transparent lid. While the image may not show the box directly, if the edit includes multiple cards arranged in such a display case, it must visually suggest or include the box structure.
Question: Is the edited image presented within or as part of a sleek, matte black collector’s box with a transparent lid, allowing visibility of the cards inside?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
