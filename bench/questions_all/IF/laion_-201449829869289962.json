      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the entire scene must be transformed into a miniature diorama enclosed within a dome glass case. This implies the presence of a transparent spherical or domed enclosure around the scene, visible as a glass-like boundary with reflections or refractions, and the scene scaled down to appear like a model.",
      "question": "Is the church and surrounding landscape enclosed within a dome-shaped glass case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The church tower must have precise clock details, meaning the clock face should be clearly defined with readable numerals, hands, and accurate proportions. Additionally, the roof of the tower must be made of copper, which would show a reddish-brown metallic texture, possibly with patina effects.",
      "question": "Does the church tower feature a detailed clock face with Roman numerals and visible hands, and does it have a copper-colored roof?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires textured, terraced hills with vineyards. This means the slopes in the background should display layered, stepped patterns consistent with agricultural terracing, and there should be visible rows of grapevines indicating vineyard cultivation.",
      "question": "Are the hills in the background depicted with visible terraces and rows of vineyards?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Tiny, realistic alpine-style houses must be added near the church. Alpine-style architecture typically includes steep roofs, wooden facades, and chalet-like designs. These houses should be significantly smaller than the main church to maintain the miniature scale.",
      "question": "Are there small, detailed alpine-style houses located near the church, consistent with miniature scale and regional architectural style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "A whimsical, rolling mist effect is required along the distant mountains. This suggests soft, swirling fog layers that appear dynamic and ethereal, not static clouds, enhancing the dreamlike quality of the diorama.",
      "question": "Is there a soft, rolling mist effect visible along the distant mountain ranges, creating a whimsical atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The diorama must be positioned on a small gold pedestal, which serves as a base elevating the entire scene. The pedestal should be visibly golden in color and proportionally small compared to the dome case.",
      "question": "Is there a small, golden-colored pedestal beneath the glass dome case supporting the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
