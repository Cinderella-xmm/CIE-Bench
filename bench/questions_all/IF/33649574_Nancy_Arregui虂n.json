      "thinking_process": "The original tail of the rooster must be replaced entirely with new elements—extravagant plumes that extend outward and transition into smoke-like tendrils. This means the tail should no longer resemble natural feathers but instead have flowing, ethereal, semi-transparent trails resembling smoke or vapor.",
      "question": "Has the rooster’s tail been replaced with long, flowing plumes that transition into wispy, smoke-like tendrils?",
