- Transform the cycling jersey into a dynamic sports ad poster
- Convert the garment into an anthropomorphic cyclist character
- Incorporate facial features on the chest area where the star motif is located
- Use the existing color scheme (blue, white, red, gray)
- Inject a sense of speed with stylized motion lines around the character
- Include the tagline "Ride Like a Star!" in bold, diagonal typography across the bottom left
- Maintain a structured yet energetic layout

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the jersey into a dynamic sports ad poster. This implies that the original image of a flat jersey must be recontextualized into a full promotional poster format, likely including background elements, layout structure, and visual dynamism typical of advertisements.
Question: Has the image been transformed from a flat jersey display into a full promotional poster layout?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies converting the jersey into an anthropomorphic cyclist character. This means the jersey must now resemble a human-like figure with limbs, posture, or implied movement, rather than just a static garment.
Question: Does the edited image depict the jersey as an anthropomorphic cyclist character with a body shape and posture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Facial features must be added specifically on the chest area where the star motif is located. This implies that the star has been replaced or modified to include eyes, a mouth, or other facial elements, forming a face within the chest region.
Question: Are facial features (such as eyes, nose, or mouth) present on the chest area where the star was originally located?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The existing color scheme includes blue, white, red, and gray. The instruction requires retaining this palette while adding new elements. The colors should remain consistent with the original jersey design.
Question: Are the dominant colors in the image limited to blue, white, red, and gray, matching the original jersey's color scheme?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Stylized motion lines are required to convey speed around the character. These should be visible as streaks, blur effects, or directional lines suggesting movement, especially around the limbs or edges of the character.
Question: Are there stylized motion lines or speed effects visible around the anthropomorphic cyclist character?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The tagline "Ride Like a Star!" must appear in bold, diagonal typography across the bottom left of the image. This means the text should be angled, prominent, and positioned in the lower-left corner.
Question: Is the text "Ride Like a Star!" displayed in bold, diagonal font in the bottom left corner of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The layout must be both structured (organized, balanced) and energetic (dynamic, visually stimulating). This implies a clear composition with visual flow, possibly including gradients, contrast, or layered elements that suggest action without chaos.
Question: Does the overall layout combine structured composition (e.g., balanced elements) with energetic visual cues (e.g., motion lines, strong angles)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
