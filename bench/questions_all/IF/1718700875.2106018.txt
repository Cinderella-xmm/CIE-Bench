Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating a 3D figurine based on Marie Antoinette’s attire. This requires transforming the current 2D image of the poodle into a sculptural representation. The key observable feature is whether the subject now appears as a solid, three-dimensional object with depth, volume, and defined edges consistent with a figurine.
Question: Is the subject rendered as a three-dimensional figurine rather than a flat image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly mentions a "lace-textured finish" for the figurine, particularly highlighting ruffled details. Lace texture implies visible patterns resembling woven fabric with openwork designs, and ruffles suggest layered, frilled fabric elements. These must be clearly present on the dress portion of the figurine.
Question: Does the figurine’s dress feature a visible lace-textured surface with intricate patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction requires mounting the figurine on a polished wooden base with gilded scrollwork. This means the base must appear made of wood with a reflective, smooth surface and decorative gold-colored ornamental flourishes, such as scrolls or curves typical of baroque design.
Question: Is the figurine mounted on a base that appears to be made of polished wood with gilded scrollwork?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for placing the figurine inside a baroque-style display case with luscious floral motifs. A baroque display case typically includes glass panels, ornate framing, and decorative elements. The floral motifs must be richly detailed and integrated into the case structure.
Question: Is the figurine enclosed within a display case that features glass panels and elaborate floral decorations consistent with baroque style?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction emphasizes echoing the lavish rococo backdrop. Rococo style is characterized by soft pastel colors, asymmetrical designs, floral patterns, and ornate detailing. The background of the final image should reflect this aesthetic, maintaining harmony with the figurine and display case.
Question: Does the background feature a lavish, rococo-inspired design with soft pastel tones and ornate floral or curvilinear patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The figurine must be inspired by Marie Antoinette’s attire, which includes an elaborate pastel dress and ornate accessories. The dress should be in soft, delicate colors (like pale pink, blue, or lavender), and include elements such as bows, embroidery, or pearls. The accessories may include jewelry or headpieces.
Question: Does the figurine wear a pastel-colored dress with elaborate details such as ruffles, embroidery, or pearls, consistent with Marie Antoinette’s fashion?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the figurine should be placed within a display case. This implies the presence of a physical enclosure with transparent sides (likely glass) and a frame. The case should surround the figurine and be distinct from the background.
Question: Is the figurine positioned inside a closed display case with visible glass panels and a decorative frame?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
