      "thinking_process": "The style must be vector-based and clean, with simplified shapes. This means the original photorealistic elements (like the astronaut suit and ISS) should be stylized into geometric, simplified forms while preserving key features such as the helmet, flag patch, and solar panels.",
      "question": "Are the astronaut, Moon, and ISS depicted using simplified, vector-style shapes rather than photorealistic rendering?",
