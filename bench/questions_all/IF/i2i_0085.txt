-Create a 3D effect making the wall painting appear outside the frame 
-Blend the wall painting into the real space visually
-Ensure the elements of the painting integrate with the room environment seamlessly 
-Maintain the original elements within the painting (such as trees, water, and sun)

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires creating a 3D effect so that the wall painting seems to pop out of the frame. This involves checking if parts of the painting extend beyond the physical boundaries of the frame, giving a sense of depth.
Question: Does the painting visibly extend beyond its frame to create a 3D effect?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes


Q2:
Thinking process: To blend the wall painting into the real space, the elements of the painting should appear integrated with the room environment. This means observing if parts of the painting seem to merge into the surrounding wall or floor.
Question: Do the elements from the painting visually merge into the room environment, such as appearing on the wall or floor?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes


Q3:
Thinking process: Ensuring the elements integrate seamlessly involves assessing if the transition between the painting and the room appears natural. This means checking for any abrupt edges or obvious separation between the painting and room elements.
Question: Are the transitions between the painting and the room environment smooth without any abrupt edges?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes


Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction asks to maintain the original elements within the painting, which means ensuring the core components like trees, water, and the sun remain recognizable even as they extend into the room.
Question: Are the original elements of the painting, such as trees, water, and the sun, still identifiable in the edited version?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes


Q5:
Thinking process: Given the 3D effect, the lighting and shadows in the extended areas of the painting should match the real-world lighting in the room to enhance realism.
Question: Do the lighting and shadows in the extended portions of the painting match those in the actual room environment?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
