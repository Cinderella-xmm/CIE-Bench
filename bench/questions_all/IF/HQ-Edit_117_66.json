      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the original book into a wooden jigsaw puzzle. This implies that the book must no longer be intact but instead broken into separate, interlocking pieces. The physical form must change from a solid object to multiple detachable parts arranged in a disassembled state.",
      "question": "Is the ornate book now represented as a collection of interlocking wooden puzzle pieces?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The dragons are part of the decorative design on the book's cover. The instruction specifies using darker wood stains for these elements, meaning the dragon motifs should appear significantly darker than the surrounding areas to create contrast and emphasize their presence.",
      "question": "Are the dragon patterns stained with darker wood tones compared to the rest of the puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The compass at the center of the bookâ€™s cover is a key element. The instruction calls for lighter shades to be used for this feature, which means it should visually stand out due to its lighter coloration relative to the surrounding darker designs.",
      "question": "Is the compass area rendered in lighter wood tones than the dragon patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly mentions ensuring visible wood grain texture. This means that the surface of each puzzle piece must show natural wood grain patterns, not a smooth or painted finish, to reflect authenticity and craftsmanship.",
      "question": "Is the wood grain texture clearly visible on the surface of the puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Smooth edges are required for the puzzle pieces to ensure they fit together properly and look professionally crafted. This involves checking whether the borders of each piece are clean and free of roughness or jagged lines.",
      "question": "Do all puzzle pieces have smooth, well-defined edges?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the pieces should be arranged on a minimalist wooden tabletop. This means the background should be simple, uncluttered, and made of wood, without additional objects or complex textures.",
      "question": "Are the puzzle pieces arranged on a plain, minimalist wooden surface without extraneous items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The goal is to highlight craftsmanship and intricate design details through contrasting wood tones. This means the differences in color between the dragons, compass, and background should be strong enough to draw attention to the fine details of the carving and layout.",
      "question": "Are the contrasting wood tones sufficient to emphasize the detailed carvings and design elements such as the dragons and compass?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
