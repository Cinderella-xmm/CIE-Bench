Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the colossal robot into a miniature 3D articulated model. This implies a significant reduction in scale and a change from a full-sized, standing robot to a small, movable model with jointed parts. The model should retain key structural features but be proportionally smaller and articulated.
Question: Is the robot now a miniature 3D articulated model instead of a full-sized giant robot?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the robot must be encased in a sleek, circular display case. This means the robot is no longer exposed but enclosed within a transparent or semi-transparent circular structure designed for display purposes. The case should have a clean, modern aesthetic.
Question: Is the robot enclosed within a circular display case?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction requires adding intricate, tiny gears visible under transparent panels on the robot’s surface. These gears should be detailed enough to suggest internal mechanics and be located beneath see-through sections of the robot’s armor or body.
Question: Are there visible tiny gears under transparent panels on the robot’s surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies positioning the display on a futuristic hexagonal black base. This implies the entire display setup rests on a geometrically distinct, six-sided platform made of dark material, likely with a modern or sci-fi design.
Question: Is the display positioned on a hexagonal black base?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction requires etching the robot’s model number in a luminous silver font on the base. This means the text must be clearly visible, glowing or reflective in silver tone, and placed on the base, likely near the front or center.
Question: Is the robot’s model number etched in a luminous silver font on the base?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for a subtly detailed mini landscape surrounding the display that evokes the original expansive scene. This means the environment around the display should include scaled-down versions of elements like trees, terrain, distant structures, or sky features from the original image, arranged to mirror the original setting.
Question: Is there a miniaturized landscape around the display that reflects the original scene’s elements (e.g., trees, terrain, distant city)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
