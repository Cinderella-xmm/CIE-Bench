Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the image into a "majestic ancient African mural," which implies a stylized, artistic rendering resembling traditional wall art. This includes flat color planes, symbolic patterns, and possibly non-realistic proportions or lighting. The visual style should resemble painted murals rather than photorealism.
Question: Is the image rendered in a mural-like artistic style with flat colors, symbolic patterns, and a non-photorealistic aesthetic?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The man’s attire must be emphasized as a regal Dashiki with gold embellishments. A regal Dashiki typically features intricate patterns, bold colors, and ornate details such as embroidery or metallic accents—especially gold. The transformation should visibly upgrade the clothing from ordinary to ceremonial.
Question: Does the man’s Dashiki feature prominent gold embellishments such as embroidery, trim, or decorative patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The man is to be depicted as a cultural guardian. This implies a dignified posture, possibly with symbolic adornments (like beads or amulets), and a commanding presence. His expression and stance should reflect authority and spiritual significance.
Question: Does the man have a dignified, authoritative posture consistent with that of a cultural guardian?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Beads and symbols are explicitly required at the shoulders. These should be visible elements added to the garment or worn as accessories, likely representing cultural or spiritual meaning. They must be clearly present and not obscured.
Question: Are there visible beads or symbolic designs located at the man’s shoulders?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The background must depict a vast savanna with stylized Acacia trees. Stylization means the trees should not be photorealistic but instead simplified, exaggerated, or patterned in a way that aligns with mural aesthetics. Their shape should remain recognizable as Acacia.
Question: Are the Acacia trees in the background stylized rather than realistic, with simplified or patterned forms?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The background should include a pattern of vivid wild grasses. This means the grass should not just be natural-looking but arranged in a deliberate, decorative, or repetitive pattern, contributing to the mural effect.
Question: Are the wild grasses in the background arranged in a vivid, repeating, or patterned design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The atmosphere must convey an old-world mystical ambiance with earthy hues. This involves a color palette dominated by browns, ochres, golds, and deep reds, avoiding modern or cool tones. Lighting should suggest dusk or dawn with soft, diffused glow.
Question: Does the overall color palette consist primarily of earthy tones such as gold, brown, ochre, and deep red, creating a mystical atmosphere?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
