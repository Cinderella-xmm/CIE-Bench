      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires cartoonizing the couple, which implies stylized features such as exaggerated proportions, simplified lines, and non-realistic rendering. This includes visible distortions from photorealism, such as oversized heads or limbs, bold outlines, and flat colors typical of cartoon art.",
      "question": "Is the couple depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated facial features and proportions?",

      "thinking_process": "The bride’s gown has intricate beadwork in the original image. The instruction specifies enhancing this detail, meaning the beads should appear more prominent, denser, or stylized in a way that draws attention—such as glowing, larger, or more ornate patterns—consistent with cartoon exaggeration.",
      "question": "Has the beadwork on the bride’s gown been enhanced to appear more elaborate or exaggerated than in the original image?",

      "question": "Has the groom’s suit lapel been enlarged to an exaggerated size compared to its original proportion?",

      "question": "Are there three distinct scenes showing the couple holding hands, toasting, and dancing?",

      "thinking_process": "Each scene must be framed in a gold-trimmed, heart-shaped border. This means every individual image (each action preset) must have a border shaped like a heart with a gold outline. This is a structural requirement for each frame.",
      "question": "Is each of the three scenes enclosed in a heart-shaped border with a gold trim?",
