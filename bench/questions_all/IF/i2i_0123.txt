Q1:
Thinking process: The instructions specify changing the timer into a robotic dog, so we need to verify if this transformation has occurred.
Question: Has the timer on the left been replaced with an illustration of a robotic dog?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instructions require the robotic dog to hold a coin, so we need to ensure it is properly depicted.
Question: Is the robotic dog clearly shown holding a coin in its paws?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: It is important to confirm that the billing function remains intact despite the change in the timer display.
Question: Does the parking meter still display billing information such as numbers and labels in a legible manner?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The overall structure of the parking meter should remain unchanged to maintain coherence with the original image.
Question: Has the overall shape and structure of the parking meter remained consistent with the original design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The robotic dog should be easily identifiable as a robot, distinguishing it from a regular dog. 
Question: Is the robotic dog designed with features such as metallic textures or mechanical parts, making it identifiable as a robot?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
