Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies a "paper-cut style" with "sharp, angular edges" to emphasize Tudor architectural features such as half-timbering and gabled roofs. This implies that all structural elements—especially the timber framing, rooflines, and windows—should appear stylized with clean, crisp lines and no soft gradients or naturalistic shading, resembling cut-out paper layers.
Question: Are all architectural elements of the building rendered with sharp, angular edges characteristic of a paper-cut art style?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires "gold foil accents" specifically on window frames and plant motifs. Gold foil would appear as reflective, metallic highlights, distinct from standard color fills, typically used to draw attention and add contrast. These should be visible on the white window panes and flower boxes.
Question: Are the window frames and plant motifs enhanced with visible gold foil-like accents?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The entrance awning is explicitly instructed to be depicted in "bold crimson hues." This means the color must be a vivid, saturated red (crimson), clearly distinguishable from the original blue-gray tone seen in the source image.
Question: Is the entrance awning colored in a bold crimson hue?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies printing on "textured cream-colored paper," which implies the background surface of each postcard should have a tactile, non-smooth appearance resembling handmade or watercolor paper, in a cream tone rather than white or off-white.
Question: Is the background of each postcard rendered with a textured cream-colored paper appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for "geometric arch borders" that complement the structured elegance of the scenes. These borders should feature repeating arch-shaped patterns, likely composed of straight lines and symmetrical angles, surrounding each postcard image.
Question: Does each postcard feature a geometric arch border around its edge?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction states that the postcards should be "framed in simple borderless framing for a modern postcard look." This means the final presentation should not include any physical frame or matting; instead, the image should extend to the edge of the card without a visible border or frame.
Question: Are the postcards presented without any visible frame or border, maintaining a clean, borderless edge?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating "a set of three art postcards" showcasing the hotel. Therefore, the final output must consist of exactly three distinct postcard images, each depicting a different view or artistic interpretation of the hotel.
Question: Are there exactly three separate postcards displayed, each showing a variation of the hotel?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
