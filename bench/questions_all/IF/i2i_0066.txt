Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the vase and bouquet into a 3D printed model. This implies checking if the objects appear as 3D models rather than traditional vases and bouquets.
Question: Has the vase and bouquet been transformed into a 3D printed display model?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The material of the 3D printed model should appear as matte PLA plastic, which means it should lack a glossy finish.
Question: Does the 3D printed model appear to be made of matte material?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Adding a display plaque at the base is a specific requirement. It should be visible and located correctly under the 3D model.
Question: Is there a display plaque added at the base of the 3D printed model?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The background change to a tech expo booth is a clear directive. This involves verifying if the setting matches a tech expo booth environment.
Question: Has the background been set as a tech expo booth?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Maintaining the original design in the 3D model means ensuring the shapes and structures of the vase and bouquet are recognizable within the new 3D form.
Question: Does the 3D printed model maintain the design of the original vase and bouquet?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
