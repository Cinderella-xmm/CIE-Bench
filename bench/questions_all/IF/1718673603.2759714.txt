- Replace the Japanese house's structure with colored glass panels framed by black lead
- Transform red trees into floral motifs with red and green segments
- Depict the large red moon with gradient circles
- Emphasize line detailing throughout the scene (especially in glass framing, floral patterns, and moon design)
- Maintain the overall composition and spatial arrangement of elements (house, trees, moon, water reflection) while applying stained glass style

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies replacing the Japanese house’s structure with colored glass panels framed by black lead. This implies that all architectural components—walls, roof, windows, railings—should be rendered as translucent colored glass sections outlined by dark, linear lead cames, mimicking traditional stained glass construction. The original solid wooden or tiled appearance must be fully replaced.
Question: Are all structural elements of the Japanese house rendered as colored glass panels bounded by black lead lines?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The red trees are to be transformed into floral motifs composed of red and green segments. This means the tree forms should no longer resemble natural foliage but instead be stylized into flower-like shapes using distinct red and green colored segments, consistent with stained glass artistry.
Question: Are the red trees replaced with stylized floral motifs made of red and green segmented glass pieces?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The large red moon must be depicted using gradient circles, meaning it should not be a solid color but rather composed of concentric or overlapping circular bands of varying red tones, creating a sense of depth and luminosity typical of stained glass representations.
Question: Is the large red moon rendered using multiple overlapping or concentric gradient circles in shades of red?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction emphasizes line detailing, which in stained glass context means clear, bold outlines (lead lines) defining each colored segment. These lines should be prominent and consistent across all elements—house, trees, moon—to reinforce the stained glass aesthetic.
Question: Are all major elements (house, trees, moon) clearly outlined with thick, black, continuous lines resembling lead came in stained glass?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: While transforming the image into stained glass, the original spatial layout—such as the position of the house, trees on either side, moon in the sky, and water reflection—must be preserved. The reflection in the water should also follow the stained glass style, showing mirrored glass patterns.
Question: Does the overall scene maintain the original composition (house centered, trees flanking, moon above, water in foreground) while all elements are styled as stained glass?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
