This style should emphasize the contours of his tai chi stance without losing anatomical accuracy or movement flow.",
      "question": "Is the elderly man depicted using a subtle line-art style with visible outlines that define his form and tai chi posture?",

      "thinking_process": "\"Softening the colors to pastel watercolors\" means the image should use light, muted tones resembling watercolor washes—such as pale blues, pinks, and creams—rather than vibrant or saturated hues. This includes both the figure and the background.",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image rendered in soft pastel watercolor tones rather than bold or naturalistic colors?",

      "thinking_process": "Minimalistic monthly date grids imply a clean, unobtrusive calendar layout—likely a small grid with numbers for days of the month, arranged neatly but not dominating the composition. It should appear as an overlay or part of the design without disrupting the Zen feel.",
      "question": "Is a minimalistic monthly date grid present in the image, showing spaces for each day of the month?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that each day’s space in the grid should reflect the subject’s balanced pose. This suggests a symbolic or stylistic correspondence—perhaps the shape of each day’s cell mimics the tai chi stance, or the layout echoes balance and symmetry.",
      "question": "Do the individual cells in the date grid reflect or mirror the balanced posture of the tai chi stance in their shape or arrangement?",
