```
- Create an educational infographic poster with the vibrant blue butterfly as the central focus
- Title the poster “Butterfly Biology Basics”
- Add labeled anatomical parts: antennae, wings, abdomen, and thorax using clear, monochrome line-drawing overlays
- Include botanical details: pink petals to illustrate the butterfly's feeding preference
- Add text boxes outlining the butterfly’s ecological role in pollination
- Maintain a delicate visual theme
- Emphasize the butterfly’s striking color as the focal point
- Keep the original butterfly image visible and prominent

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the image into an educational infographic. This implies structural changes such as adding text, labels, and layout elements typical of infographics. The core requirement is whether the image now functions as an infographic rather than a standalone nature photograph.
Question: Is the image formatted as an educational infographic with structured layout elements such as titles, labels, and text boxes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The title "Butterfly Biology Basics" is explicitly mentioned. It must be present and clearly visible in the edited image to satisfy this requirement. The presence of a text element with that exact wording is verifiable.
Question: Is the title “Butterfly Biology Basics” displayed prominently at the top or center of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies labeling of four anatomical parts—antennae, wings, abdomen, and thorax—with monochrome line-drawing overlays. These should be visible as clear, non-colorful outlines or diagrams superimposed on the butterfly.
Question: Are the anatomical parts (antennae, wings, abdomen, thorax) labeled with monochrome line-drawing overlays on the butterfly?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The inclusion of pink petals is required to show the butterfly's feeding preference. These should be part of the botanical elements in the scene and not just background flora. They should be visually distinct and possibly highlighted or annotated.
Question: Are pink flower petals included in the image to represent the butterfly’s feeding preference?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction requires text boxes explaining the butterfly’s ecological role in pollination. These must be present as separate text elements, likely near the flowers or butterfly, containing relevant descriptive content.
Question: Are there text boxes in the image that explain the butterfly’s role in pollination?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The visual theme must remain delicate, which implies soft lines, harmonious colors, and no harsh contrasts. The butterfly’s vivid blue should still dominate the composition as the focal point, without being obscured by overly busy design elements.
Question: Is the overall visual style delicate, with the butterfly’s vibrant blue color clearly emphasized as the central focal point?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The original butterfly must remain visible and recognizable, even with added overlays. The editing should not obscure or distort the butterfly’s form beyond recognition.
Question: Is the original vibrant blue butterfly still clearly visible and intact in the edited image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
