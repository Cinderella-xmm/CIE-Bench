This implies a clear depiction of the woman in a relaxed pose with physical contact (e.g., leaning) against a structure made of straw or thatched material. The background should reflect a rural or traditional setting consistent with such architecture.",

This requires a clear silhouette (dark outline) of the woman set against a background that combines natural grassland elements with digital aesthetics—such as pixelation, glowing lines, or grid patterns—indicating a fusion of nature and technology.",
