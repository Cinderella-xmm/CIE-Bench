Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires cartoonizing the woman’s figure. This implies a stylistic transformation where proportions may be exaggerated, lines simplified, and features rendered in a non-realistic, illustrative manner—such as rounded shapes, bold outlines, or stylized facial features. The original image is photorealistic, so a successful edit must visibly shift toward a cartoon style.
Question: Is the woman's figure stylized in a cartoon-like manner with exaggerated proportions or simplified features?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The red dress must be accentuated with gold embroidery. This means visible gold decorative patterns should be added to the dress fabric, such as stitching, borders, or ornamental motifs. The presence of these details must be clearly observable.
Question: Are there visible gold embroidery details added to the red dress?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The butterfly wings must be enlarged compared to their original size in the image. This involves increasing their scale relative to the woman’s body, making them more prominent in the composition.
Question: Are the butterfly wings significantly larger than they were in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Intricate textures must be added to the wings. This refers to detailed patterns such as veining, color gradients, or fine surface structures that enhance realism or fantasy appearance beyond the basic wing shape.
Question: Do the butterfly wings feature detailed, intricate textures such as fine veins or layered patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Each month of the calendar must be placed on a different wing. This means at least twelve distinct textual labels (January through December) should appear distributed across the two wings, likely in a structured format like rows or columns.
Question: Are the names of all twelve months displayed on the butterfly wings?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The calendar must be arranged on a wooden panel with floral inlay. This implies a background or base element made of wood with embedded floral designs, possibly carved or painted, serving as a frame or platform for the calendar.
Question: Is the entire composition placed on a wooden panel that includes floral inlay patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The overall design must enhance collectible allure, which can be interpreted as visual richness, craftsmanship, and aesthetic appeal—such as high detail, harmonious colors, framed presentation, or vintage/artisanal feel. This is achieved through the combination of materials, textures, and layout.
Question: Does the final image include design elements (such as wood grain, floral patterns, or embossed text) that suggest it is intended as a collectible item?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
