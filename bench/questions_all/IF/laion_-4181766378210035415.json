    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly requires transforming the entire bed structure into interlocking LEGO bricks. This means the frame, mattress, and all components must be constructed from visible LEGO-style elements, not just textured to resemble them. The presence of studs, brick edges, and modular connections should be observable.",
      "question": "Is the bed fully constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, including the frame, mattress, and base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The original bedding has a light blue botanical pattern on a white background. To faithfully mimic this, the LEGO bricks used must include both white and light blue colors arranged in a pattern that replicates the leaf-like designs seen on the original blanket and pillows.",
      "question": "Are white and light blue LEGO bricks used to recreate the botanical pattern visible on the original bedding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The headboard in the original image is flat and angular. The instruction specifies replacing it with smooth, curved LEGO pieces to achieve a rounded look. This implies a departure from standard rectangular LEGO elements and the use of specialized curved or arched LEGO parts.",
      "question": "Has the headboard been replaced with smooth, curved LEGO pieces to create a rounded shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies stacking smaller LEGO bricks to form the pillows, which should enhance the three-dimensional feel. This means the pillows should not be flat but composed of layered or stacked LEGO elements, clearly distinguishable from the rest of the bed.",
      "question": "Are the pillows made from stacked smaller LEGO bricks, giving them a distinct three-dimensional structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The background in the original image is a neutral grayscale. The instruction requires maintaining this background while placing the LEGO bed within it. Any change in background color, texture, or lighting would violate this requirement.",
      "question": "Is the background of the edited image the same grayscale as the original image?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall aesthetic should be playful yet structured. \"Playful\" suggests visible LEGO elements and creative construction, while \"structured\" implies orderly placement and clear modular design. The final image should not appear chaotic or abstract but clearly represent a LEGO-built bed.",
      "question": "Does the LEGO bed appear playful due to visible brick construction and structured due to orderly arrangement and clear modular design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
