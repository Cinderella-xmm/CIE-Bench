Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires cartoonizing the man's form and exaggerating scooter details. This involves visible distortion of proportions (e.g., larger head, simplified features) and stylized elements like oversized wheels or handlebars. These must be clearly distinguishable from realistic rendering.
Question: Has the man's form been cartoonized with exaggerated proportions such as an enlarged head, simplified facial features, or distorted body shape?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Exaggerated scooter details imply visual enhancements beyond realism—such as oversized fenders, comically large wheels, or stylized chrome accents. These are not present in the original image and must be added to meet the instruction.
Question: Are the scooter's details exaggerated, such as oversized parts, stylized chrome, or unrealistic proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Sepia tones refer to a monochromatic color scheme dominated by brownish-yellow hues, simulating aged photographs. The entire image should appear desaturated and tinted accordingly, especially in skin tones, clothing, and background.
Question: Is the overall image rendered in sepia tones, with a consistent brownish-yellow hue across all elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Faded edges simulate wear and tear typical of old postcards. This means the borders of the image should gradually lose detail and brightness, creating a soft vignette effect that mimics aging paper.
Question: Do the edges of the image show a faded or worn appearance, simulating the look of an old postcard?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Ornate art-nouveau frames involve flowing lines, floral motifs, and decorative borders characteristic of the Art Nouveau movement. These frames must surround the central image and be visually distinct.
Question: Does the image have an ornate frame with flowing lines, organic patterns, or floral designs typical of Art Nouveau style?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A blank writing space beneath the image is required for personal messages, akin to traditional postcards. It must be clearly demarcated and unoccupied.
Question: Is there a blank area beneath the main image designated for writing, free of any text or graphics?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: Textured parchment implies a surface resembling aged paper with visible grain, uneven texture, and slight discoloration. This should affect the entire background layer of the image.
Question: Is the image printed on a surface with visible parchment-like texture, including grain and subtle imperfections?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: Twine-bound sets suggest multiple postcards arranged together, tied with string, and presented as collectible travel memorabilia. This includes physical grouping and binding elements.
Question: Are multiple postcards grouped together and bound with twine, forming a set suitable for display or collection?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
