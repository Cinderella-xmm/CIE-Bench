      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the dog into a plush stuffed animal. This implies changes in texture (soft, fabric-like), shape (slightly rounded, less anatomically precise), and material appearance (non-living, stitched seams). The presence of visible stitching, soft edges, and lack of realistic fur texture would confirm this transformation.",
      "question": "Is the dog depicted as a plush stuffed animal with soft, fabric-like texture and visible seams?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires maintaining the white fur and sandy-colored spots. These should be present on the plush version, matching the original coloration but adapted to a textile surface. Sandy-colored spots must be visibly present and not replaced or altered in hue.",
      "question": "Does the plush dog retain white fur with sandy-colored spots in the same pattern as the original?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The original harness must be replaced with a crystal-studded corset. This involves replacing the existing garment with a new one that includes reflective or glittering elements resembling crystals, giving it a sparkling visual effect. The new item must clearly be a corset-style garment, not just any accessory.",
      "question": "Has the harness been replaced with a corset featuring visible crystal-like embellishments that create a sparkling effect?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The plush figure must be positioned on a smooth, minimalist wooden shelf. This implies a flat, horizontal surface made of wood with no decorative elements, and the background should not include natural scenes like beaches or water. The shelf must be clearly visible beneath the plush.",
      "question": "Is the plush dog placed on a smooth, minimalist wooden shelf without any distracting background elements?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the paws should be slightly dangling, suggesting they are not fully supported by the shelf. This adds character and implies a relaxed pose. The positioning must show at least one paw hanging below the shelf edge.",
      "question": "Are the paws of the plush dog slightly dangling below the edge of the shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes highlighting the cute demeanor. This can be assessed through facial expression (soft eyes, gentle smile), overall posture, and the stylized nature of the plush. Features like large eyes, small nose, and soft contours contribute to cuteness.",
      "question": "Does the plush dog exhibit a cute demeanor through soft facial features, gentle expression, and overall design?",
