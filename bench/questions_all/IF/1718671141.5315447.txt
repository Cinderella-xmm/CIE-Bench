```
- Transform the circular glass building into a steampunk-inspired architectural piece
- Add intricate brass gears to the structure
- Include copper funnels as part of the design
- Replace the observatory dome with one adorned with ornate metalwork
- Replace the moon with giant clock faces
- Integrate rivets into the clock faces and structure
- Add steam venting from the structure
- Maintain the reflective water surface and surrounding environment (trees, sky)
- Ensure the overall aesthetic aligns with steampunk style (mechanical, industrial, vintage-futuristic elements)

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the original modern glass building into a steampunk-style structure. This implies replacing sleek glass surfaces with mechanical elements like gears, pipes, and metallic textures. The core transformation is architectural style change, which must be visually evident through material and form.
Question: Does the building now feature visible brass gears integrated into its exterior?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Copper funnels are explicitly mentioned as required additions. These should be distinguishable by their shape (funnel-like) and color (copper tone), typically used in steampunk designs for ventilation or fluid transfer.
Question: Are there copper-colored funnel-shaped structures present on the building?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The observatory dome must be replaced with an ornate metalwork-adorned dome. This means the original transparent dome should no longer exist and be substituted with a detailed, decorative metal construction consistent with steampunk aesthetics.
Question: Has the original glass dome been replaced with a dome featuring intricate metalwork patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The moon must be replaced with giant clock faces. This involves removing the celestial body and substituting it with large, functional-looking clocks that resemble those found in steampunk settings—likely with Roman numerals, hands, and mechanical details.
Question: Is the moon in the sky replaced by one or more giant clock faces?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Rivets are specified as part of the clock faces and structure. They are small, raised fasteners commonly seen in industrial designs. Their presence indicates attention to mechanical detail and authenticity in steampunk styling.
Question: Are rivets visibly present on the clock faces and/or the building's exterior?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Steam venting is a key element of steampunk imagery, suggesting active machinery. This should appear as plumes of vapor emanating from pipes, valves, or vents on the building.
Question: Is there visible steam or vapor emitting from parts of the building?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The reflection in the water must remain intact to preserve the scene’s composition. Even after transformation, the reflection should mirror the modified structure accurately.
Question: Is the reflection of the transformed building clearly visible in the water below?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
