      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the snowy mountain peaks should form the creature's jagged wings. This requires identifying whether the mountain range has been visually altered to resemble wing-like structures with sharp, angular edges consistent with \"jagged\" morphology. The transformation must preserve the snow-capped appearance but reinterpret the shape to suggest wings.",
      "question": "Are the snowy mountain peaks visibly reshaped into jagged, wing-like structures?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The foreground lake must be transformed into reflective scales. This implies the water surface should no longer appear as natural water but instead show patterns resembling overlapping, shiny scales—possibly with highlights and textures mimicking reptilian or metallic skin. The reflection property suggests light interaction similar to polished surfaces.",
      "question": "Does the foreground lake display a pattern of reflective, scale-like textures across its surface?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The winding peninsula must become a sinewy tail. This means the landform should be elongated and curved in a way that suggests muscle and movement, possibly with tapering ends and organic contours, resembling a living tail rather than a static geographical feature.",
      "question": "Is the winding peninsula reshaped into a long, curving, sinewy tail structure?",

      "thinking_process": "The distant houses must form a metallic spine. This requires the buildings to be stylized or merged into a linear, rigid, segmented structure resembling a backbone made of metal, possibly with glowing or reflective elements to emphasize materiality.",
      "question": "Are the distant houses reconfigured into a continuous, segmented metallic spine-like structure?",

      "thinking_process": "Swirling cloud eyes must be added. These should be visible formations in the sky—likely composed of clouds shaped like eyes with swirling patterns, possibly with dark pupils and radiating swirls to suggest motion and gaze.",

      "thinking_process": "Windswept grass fur must be blended into the landscape. This means the dry grasslands should now appear as if they are flowing hair or fur, with directional streaks suggesting wind movement, and integrated into the body of the creature.",
      "question": "Does the grassland area show directional, windswept textures resembling fur covering the creature’s body?",
