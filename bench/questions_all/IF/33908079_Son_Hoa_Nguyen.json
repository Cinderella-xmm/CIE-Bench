      "thinking_process": "The instruction \"cartoonize the worker slightly\" implies subtle stylization such as simplified facial features, exaggerated proportions (e.g., larger eyes or softer edges), or smoother lines while maintaining recognizable human form. This is an observable stylistic change that should be detectable in the final image.",
