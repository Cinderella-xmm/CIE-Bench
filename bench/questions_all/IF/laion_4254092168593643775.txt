Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire image into an energy drink label design. This implies that the composition should resemble a product label, with clear branding elements, visual hierarchy, and layout typical of beverage packaging. The presence of a border or frame around the content would indicate this transformation.
Question: Is the overall image framed or designed to resemble a product label with defined edges and layout consistent with a beverage packaging design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Dynamic streaks of sand are explicitly mentioned as background graphics. These should be visible behind or around the rider, emphasizing motion and speed. They must be stylized, not just natural terrain blur, to serve as graphic elements.
Question: Are there visible, stylized streaks of sand in the background that convey motion and act as graphic elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The rider’s action must be rendered in a minimalist silhouette style, meaning simplified shapes, reduced detail, and likely high contrast between the figure and background. This is distinct from a realistic depiction.
Question: Is the motocross rider depicted as a simplified, high-contrast silhouette with minimal detail, emphasizing form over texture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The brand name "RaceFuel" must be present in bold typography. This means large, prominent lettering, possibly with strong font weight and color contrast, positioned clearly within the design.
Question: Is the text "RaceFuel" displayed in bold, prominent typography somewhere within the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A track outline must be overlaid in bright, iconic colors—suggesting vibrant hues like red, blue, yellow, or neon tones—to stand out and symbolize racing. It should be a simplified circuit shape.
Question: Is there a track outline visible in the image, rendered in bright, vivid colors (e.g., red, yellow, blue) and positioned as an overlay?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A speedometer icon with a maxed-out needle must be included at the bottom of the image. This implies a circular gauge with a needle pointing to the maximum value, likely in a stylized, graphic format.
Question: Is there a speedometer icon located at the bottom of the image, showing a needle pointing to the maximum speed?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The overall narrative must convey power and speed. This can be evaluated through visual cues such as motion lines, high contrast, dynamic angles, and energetic color palette. The combination of all elements should create a sense of adrenaline and performance.
Question: Do the combined visual elements—silhouette, streaks, typography, track, and speedometer—collectively communicate a narrative of power and speed?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
