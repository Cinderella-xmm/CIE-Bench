Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the dragonfly into an ethereal water spirit. This implies a fundamental change in appearance—no longer a realistic insect but a mystical, fluid-like entity. Key indicators include non-solid form, glowing or semi-transparent features, and a connection to water elements.
Question: Is the dragonfly visually transformed into a non-realistic, ethereal water spirit rather than a regular insect?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The wings must be translucent and shimmering, resembling cascading waterfalls. This involves visible translucency, motion-like flow patterns, and possibly light refraction effects similar to flowing water.
Question: Do the wings appear translucent with shimmering, waterfall-like patterns that suggest flowing water?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The body should feature iridescent, scaly textures with swirling blue patterns. Iridescence means color shifts under light; scales imply layered surface texture; swirling blue patterns indicate dynamic, wave-like designs.
Question: Does the dragonfly's body display iridescent, scale-like textures with visible swirling blue patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Luminescent aquatic vines must be entwined around the legs. These vines should glow softly (luminescent), resemble underwater plants, and physically wrap around the legs.
Question: Are there glowing, plant-like vines visibly wrapped around the dragonfly’s legs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The eyes must reflect the depths of an ocean’s abyss—this suggests dark, deep blue or black tones with hints of depth, possibly including subtle light reflections like bioluminescence or distant glimmers.
Question: Do the dragonfly’s eyes appear dark and deep, resembling the abyssal depths of the ocean with subtle inner glows or reflective qualities?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A faint aura of mist should surround the dragonfly. This refers to a soft, hazy glow or vapor effect near the edges of the figure, not solid clouds, but a subtle atmospheric presence.
Question: Is there a faint, misty halo or vapor effect surrounding the dragonfly?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
