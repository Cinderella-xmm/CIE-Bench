Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the guitar body into a dragon's torso. This involves altering the shape and texture to resemble a mythical creature’s body, including adding organic contours, possibly scales or muscle definition, and ensuring it no longer looks like a standard guitar body.
Question: Has the body of the guitar been transformed into a dragon's torso with organic, beast-like features such as scales or musculature?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The guitar neck must be reimagined as the dragon’s elongated and elegant neck. This implies extending and reshaping the neck to mimic a dragon’s long, curved, serpentine form, maintaining elegance and proportionality relative to the new torso.
Question: Has the guitar neck been reshaped into an elongated, elegant dragon neck that extends naturally from the torso?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The tuning pegs are explicitly instructed to be replaced with golden, horn-like spikes. This means removing the original tuning machines and replacing them with ornate, golden, spike-shaped structures resembling horns, likely protruding from the headstock area.
Question: Have the original tuning pegs been replaced with golden, horn-like spikes on the headstock?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The fretboard must be embellished with luminescent runes. This means visible glowing or luminous symbols (runes) should be present along the fretboard, possibly glowing in the dark or emitting light, enhancing the magical or enchanted theme.
Question: Are there visible luminescent runes embedded or drawn along the fretboard of the guitar?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The strings need to be converted into fiery tendrils, implying that the six metallic strings are now replaced with dynamic, flame-like extensions that appear to burn or glow with fire, suggesting motion and heat.
Question: Have the guitar strings been replaced with fiery, flame-like tendrils that extend from the bridge to the nut?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The cutaway horns (the two pointed edges of the guitar body) must be morphed into majestic wings with intricate, scale-like patterns. This transformation requires turning those sharp edges into wing structures, complete with layered feathers or scales, and detailed textures resembling dragon wings.
Question: Have the cutaway horns of the guitar been transformed into majestic wings featuring intricate, scale-like patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
