- Transform the jagged mountain peaks into ancient dragon spirits
- Add rocky scales to the mountain surfaces

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly requires transforming the jagged mountain peaks into ancient dragon spirits. This involves reinterpreting the natural rock formations as mythical creatures, specifically dragons. A successful edit must visually represent this transformation by giving the peaks organic, creature-like qualities while preserving their general silhouette.
Question: Are the jagged mountain peaks transformed into ancient dragon spirits with distinct dragon-like features such as heads, limbs, and tails?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies adding rocky scales to the mountains. These should be visible textural elements resembling reptilian skin, integrated into the rock surfaces of the dragon figures. This detail is essential for conveying the "dragon" aspect of the transformation.
Question: Do the mountain surfaces feature visible rocky scales that mimic dragon skin texture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Moss-covered spines are mentioned as a key visual trait. This implies dark green or brownish patches along the ridges of the dragon forms, particularly along the dorsal lines, suggesting age and integration with nature. This element contributes to the ancient and mystical feel of the dragons.
Question: Are the spines of the dragon-shaped mountains covered in moss-like vegetation?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The tallest peak must be morphed into a dragon’s head, which includes specific features like crystal horns and serpentine eyes. These are critical identifying traits of the dragon spirit and must be clearly present and distinguishable.
Question: Is the tallest mountain peak reshaped into a dragon’s head with clearly visible crystal horns and serpentine eyes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The ridges are to extend as sinuous bodies fading into mist, with each gradient step resembling coiled limbs or tails. This requires the mountain contours to curve and twist naturally, mimicking movement and anatomy, while blending into the foggy background.
Question: Do the mountain ridges extend into sinuous, snake-like bodies that fade into the mist, with sections resembling coiled limbs or tails?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction emphasizes seamless blending into the ethereal landscape. This means the dragon forms must not appear jarringly artificial but instead integrate with the existing light, fog, and color gradients of the scene.
Question: Do the dragon-shaped mountains blend seamlessly into the surrounding misty, atmospheric environment without abrupt visual breaks?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The original image has a soft, golden-hued sunrise with mist and layered mountains. The editing should preserve this atmosphere while incorporating the fantasy elements. Therefore, lighting and mood should remain consistent with the original.
Question: Is the overall lighting and atmospheric quality (such as warm glow, mist, and layered depth) preserved from the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
