      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the entire image into an Art Nouveau stained glass style. This implies that the geisha's figure should resemble stained glass, with visible lead lines separating colored sections, translucent appearance, and decorative borders. The visual texture must reflect glass panels with defined edges.",
      "question": "Does the geisha's figure appear as a stained glass artwork with distinct lead-like outlines separating colored sections?",

      "thinking_process": "The kimono must be redesigned with flowing organic motifs and vivid jewel tones. Organic motifs in Art Nouveau typically include stylized plants, vines, or floral patterns. Jewel tones refer to rich colors like emerald, sapphire, ruby, amethyst, etc., often used in stained glass.",
      "question": "Are the kimono patterns composed of flowing, curvilinear organic designs such as vines or flowers, rendered in vivid jewel tones (e.g., deep reds, blues, greens)?",

      "thinking_process": "Cherry blossoms must be transformed into intricate glass petals. This means they should no longer look like natural flowers but instead resemble stained glass piecesâ€”translucent, segmented, with internal color gradients and outlined by dark lines resembling lead came.",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms depicted as glass-like elements with segmented petals, dark outlines, and translucent coloring typical of stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The fan must be converted into a peacock fan with iridescent feathers. A peacock fan features a large, fanned-out tail with eye-shaped patterns and shimmering colors. Iridescence suggests shifting hues depending on angle, which in stained glass can be simulated with layered colors or reflective textures.",
      "question": "Has the traditional hand fan been replaced with a peacock-style fan featuring eye-patterned feathers and iridescent, multi-colored surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The background must become a mosaic of curving lines and shades, reflecting Art Nouveau aesthetics. This includes sinuous, flowing lines, geometric yet organic forms, and harmonious color gradients, possibly resembling a stained glass window with abstract patterns.",
      "question": "Is the background composed of curving, interwoven lines and shaded areas forming an abstract mosaic pattern consistent with Art Nouveau design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
