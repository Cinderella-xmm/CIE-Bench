      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the sailboat into a walnut wood sculpture. This means the entire vessel must appear as a solid wooden carving, not a real boat or painted object. The material should be visually identifiable as walnut wood—dark brown with visible grain—and the structure should resemble a crafted sculpture rather than a functional ship.",
      "question": "Is the sailboat rendered entirely as a carved walnut wood sculpture, with no metallic, fabric, or realistic marine materials visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The sails are specifically described as being made from smooth, polished walnut with intricate grain patterns. This implies that the sails should not be white cloth but instead have the texture and color of polished wood, including visible wood grain, and appear solid and sculpted.",
      "question": "Are the sails made of smooth, polished walnut wood featuring visible and intricate grain patterns, rather than fabric or translucent material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The hull is instructed to have deeper, textured carvings mimicking original planks. This means the side of the boat should show deliberate grooves, ridges, or relief work that simulate the appearance of wooden planking, consistent with hand-carved sculpture details.",
      "question": "Does the hull of the sculpture feature deep, textured carvings that clearly mimic the appearance of wooden planks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The sculpture must be positioned on a sleek, pale beige pedestal. This adds a display context, indicating that the boat is no longer floating but elevated for viewing. The pedestal should be minimalistic and light in color to contrast with the dark walnut.",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed on a sleek, pale beige pedestal that elevates it above the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes that the craftsmanship and natural wood tones should stand out against the background. This implies that the lighting and background must not overpower the sculpture—there should be sufficient contrast so that the wood’s texture, color, and detail are clearly visible.",
      "question": "Do the natural wood tones and detailed craftsmanship of the walnut sculpture clearly stand out against the background, without being obscured by similar colors or excessive brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Although the original image shows a reflection in water, the edited version must maintain visual coherence. Since the sculpture is now on a pedestal, it should not be floating; thus, the reflection may be altered or removed. However, if the reflection remains, it should reflect the sculpture's new wooden form, not the original boat.",
      "question": "Is the reflection in the water consistent with the wooden sculpture, showing the carved hull and walnut sails, rather than a realistic boat reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
