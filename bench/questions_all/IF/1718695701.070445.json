      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the capybara into a metallic sculpture with a polished bronze surface. This implies that the entire body should no longer have natural fur texture but instead exhibit a reflective, smooth, metallic finish characteristic of polished bronze. The color should be consistent with bronze (typically golden-brown with reflective highlights), and there should be no visible organic textures like fur.",
      "question": "Is the capybara's body rendered as a polished bronze metallic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The knitted hat must be replaced with a helmet design made of matching bronze material. The original blue knitted hat is present in the image, so the edited version must remove it entirely and replace it with a helmet that has intricate detailing and matches the bronze material of the sculpture. The helmet should not resemble a knit cap but rather a structured, possibly armored or ornamental headpiece.",
      "question": "Has the blue knitted hat been replaced with an intricately detailed bronze helmet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The sunglasses must be transformed into elegant glass lenses set in bronze frames. This means the original blue-framed sunglasses should be replaced with lenses that appear transparent or glass-like, framed in bronze to match the sculpture’s material. The shape may remain similar, but the materials must reflect the specified change.",
      "question": "Are the sunglasses now composed of glass lenses set in bronze frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Although the capybara is transformed into a metal sculpture, the instruction specifies maintaining fur details through engraved lines. This means that while the surface is metallic, fine linear engravings should mimic the pattern and direction of fur, especially around facial features and body contours.",
      "question": "Are the fur patterns preserved as engraved lines on the bronze surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The sculpture must be positioned on an understated marble base. This implies a simple, clean, neutral-colored stone platform—likely white or gray marble—with minimal ornamentation. It should provide a stable foundation and contrast subtly with the bronze sculpture without distracting from it.",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed on a plain, understated marble base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
