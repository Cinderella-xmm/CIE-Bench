Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies converting the horse and elephant into chibi-style 3D models. Chibi style typically involves exaggerated features such as large heads and small bodies. The question should focus on whether these characteristics are present.
Question: Are the horse and elephant depicted as chibi-style 3D models?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Thinking process: The instruction requires maintaining the current pose of the horse standing on the elephant's back. The question should verify if this specific positioning is preserved.
Question: Is the horse still standing on the elephant's back in the edited image?

Question: Is the scene displayed within an ornate photo frame?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the horse and elephant to be in 3D model form. The question should ensure that they are indeed rendered in 3D rather than remaining in 2D.
