Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the Viking ship model into a board game packaging. This implies that the original 3D model must be replaced with a flat or box-like structure resembling a game box, where the ship is now depicted as artwork on the cover. The presence of a physical box with defined edges and a front-facing surface displaying the ship image would indicate successful transformation.
Question: Is the Viking ship displayed as artwork on the front cover of a rectangular board game box?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies styling the ship with Norse motifs. These include visible elements such as runic patterns, interlacing designs, animal heads (like dragons), and traditional ornamentation commonly associated with Norse art. These should be clearly visible on the ship’s depiction.
Question: Are Norse motifs such as runic patterns, interlacing designs, or dragon heads visibly integrated into the artwork of the ship on the box?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for bold typography for the title "Voyage of the Vikings." This means the text must be present, legible, stylistically prominent (e.g., large font, strong contrast), and positioned in a way consistent with game packaging design (likely at the top or center).
Question: Is the title "Voyage of the Vikings" displayed in bold, readable typography on the box cover?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction states to use the sail design for a game board layout. This implies that the pattern on the sail—specifically the circular knotwork design—should be replicated or adapted into a grid-like or playable surface layout, possibly on a separate section of the box or within the artwork.
Question: Is the circular knotwork pattern from the sail used as part of a game board layout, such as a grid or path system, within the box artwork?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction requires creating mini figures modeled after the rowers. These should appear as small, stylized human figures placed along the side of the ship or on the game board, matching the appearance of the original rowers but scaled down and designed like game pieces.
Question: Are there small, stylized figures resembling the rowers placed along the ship's side or on the game board area?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies adding wooden texture accents on the box sides for authenticity. This means the sides of the game box should display a wood grain texture or finish, mimicking real wood to enhance the historical theme.
Question: Do the side panels of the game box feature a visible wooden texture or grain pattern?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
