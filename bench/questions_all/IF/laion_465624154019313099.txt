Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating a comic strip titled “Cake Conundrum!”, which implies a multi-panel layout with speech bubbles and sequential storytelling. This requires transforming the single image into a two-panel comic format.
Question: Is the edited image a two-panel comic strip with the title “Cake Conundrum!” displayed at the top?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The cake must be transformed into a living creature with expressive eyes and a strawberry hat. This involves adding anthropomorphic features such as eyes and positioning the strawberries as a hat-like element.
Question: Does the cake have expressive eyes added to its surface, positioned where the face would be, and is there a strawberry placed on top resembling a hat?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Panel 1 requires a surprised expression with wide eyes and specific dialogue. The dialogue must appear in a speech bubble near the cake creature.
Question: In the first panel, are the cake creature’s eyes wide open, showing surprise, and is the dialogue “Who ate my delicious corner?!” present in a speech bubble?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The background of Panel 1 must include a party atmosphere with faint silhouettes of utensils (like spoons or forks) peeking from the edges. These should be stylized but recognizable.
Question: In Panel 1, are there faint silhouettes of utensils (such as spoons or forks) visible in the background, suggesting a party setting?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Panel 2 requires a determined expression, a shaking head gesture, and a new dialogue. Additionally, strawberries must act as bodyguards and garnishes must form a shield around the cake.
Question: In Panel 2, does the cake creature appear to be shaking its head, has the dialogue “No more free bites, time for dessert defense!” been added, and are strawberries and garnishes arranged as bodyguards and a shield?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
