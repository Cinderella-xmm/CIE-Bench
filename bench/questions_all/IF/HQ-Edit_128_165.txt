Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the lantern into a jellyfish. This means the original object must no longer resemble a lantern structurally or functionally but must instead have the form of a jellyfishâ€”specifically, a bell-shaped body with trailing appendages. The transformation must be complete and not retain any recognizable features of a traditional lantern.
Question: Has the ornate lantern been fully transformed into a jellyfish shape, with a bell-shaped body and flowing appendages?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The metal framing of the lantern is explicitly instructed to become iridescent tendrils. Iridescent implies a shimmering, rainbow-like quality that changes color with angle, and "tendrils" indicates long, thin, flexible structures extending from the main body. These should replace all rigid metal components.
Question: Have the metal framing elements been replaced with iridescent, ribbon-like tendrils extending from the body?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The glass panels are described as morphing into a translucent bell. This means the central structure must now appear soft, semi-transparent, and dome-like, resembling a jellyfish's bell. It should allow light to pass through while maintaining a fluid, organic appearance.
Question: Have the glass panels been transformed into a translucent, bell-shaped body that appears soft and fluid?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The intricate geometric patterns on the lantern must be replaced with swirling bioluminescent designs. Bioluminescent implies self-emitting light, often in cool tones like blue, green, or purple, and "swirling" suggests dynamic, flowing lines rather than static patterns.
Question: Are the original patterns replaced with glowing, swirling, organic bioluminescent designs within the jellyfish's body?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies adding glowing, star-like nodules along the tendrils. These should be small, bright points of light resembling stars or orbs, evenly or rhythmically distributed along the length of each tendril.
Question: Are there glowing, star-like nodules visible along the length of the iridescent tendrils?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The final scene must depict an ethereal underwater realm. This includes visual cues such as water-like textures, diffused lighting, floating particles, possibly faint aquatic flora or fauna, and a sense of depth and tranquility. The jellyfish should appear suspended in this environment.
Question: Is the jellyfish depicted floating in an underwater environment with ambient lighting, soft diffusion, and visual elements suggesting water (e.g., particles, light rays, depth)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
