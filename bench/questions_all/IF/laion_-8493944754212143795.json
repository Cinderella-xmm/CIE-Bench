      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the natural waterfall and rocks into a fantastical aquatic dragon. This involves a complete morphological change where the original physical elements are reinterpreted as parts of a mythical creature. The core requirement is that the dragon must be clearly recognizable and emerge from the water, with its form derived from the existing elements.",
      "question": "Is the waterfall and surrounding rocks visibly transformed into the shape of an aquatic dragon emerging from the water?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The flowing water must become the dragon’s mane, which implies a transformation in texture and appearance—specifically, it should appear shimmering and translucent rather than ordinary rushing water. This requires a visual shift toward ethereal, semi-transparent strands resembling hair or tendrils.",
      "question": "Does the flowing water appear as a shimmering, translucent mane extending from the dragon’s head or neck area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The rocks must be reimagined as part of the dragon’s armored body, meaning their structure should now resemble scaled skin with defined segments and a rugged, protective texture consistent with reptilian armor. The original rock formations should no longer appear as inert stone but as integrated parts of a living creature.",
      "question": "Are the rocks reshaped into a scale-armored body structure that forms the torso or limbs of the dragon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The white foam must transform into misty cloud wings, suggesting soft, ethereal appendages made of vapor-like material. These wings should be positioned on either side of the dragon, with a feathery or cloud-like appearance that contrasts with solid rock and water.",
      "question": "Do the white foam areas form two distinct, misty cloud-like wings attached to the dragon’s back or sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "Glowing blue aquatic runes must be added along the dragon’s scales. These should be visible as luminous symbols or patterns embedded in the surface of the scales, emitting a soft blue light. Their placement should follow the contours of the body and enhance the mystical theme.",
      "question": "Are there glowing blue runes visible along the dragon’s scales, appearing as luminous symbols or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall scene must convey a mystical presence, which can be assessed by observing whether the dragon has an otherworldly aura—such as glowing elements, translucent textures, ambient light effects, or atmospheric haze. The transformation should not just be structural but also atmospheric.",
      "question": "Does the image convey a mystical atmosphere through glowing effects, translucent textures, or ethereal lighting around the dragon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
