Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the image into a Qing Dynasty traditional portrait. This requires adherence to historical visual conventions such as formal composition, dignified pose, and period-appropriate attire and accessories. A Qing Dynasty portrait typically features a solemn expression, structured framing, and symbolic elements like dragons or imperial motifs.
Question: Is the overall composition and style of the image consistent with a Qing Dynasty traditional portrait, including formal posture and dignified expression?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly mentions an "elaborately embroidered silk robe with dragon patterns." Dragon motifs are central to imperial Qing attire, especially in ceremonial robes. The embroidery must be detailed and visible, and the material should appear luxurious and silken.
Question: Does the subject wear a robe with visible, detailed dragon embroidery on a silk-like fabric?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction requires "opulent jade jewelry" to be added. Jade was highly valued in Qing culture and often used in court jewelry. This means the presence of greenish, polished, gem-like adornments—likely necklaces, pendants, or earrings—should be visible and integrated into the attire.
Question: Are there visible pieces of jade jewelry, such as pendants, necklaces, or earrings, that appear opulent and made of jade material?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The hairstyle must be transformed into an ornate headpiece with "intricate jade hairpins." In Qing Dynasty fashion, women wore elaborate headdresses with pins, combs, and decorative elements, often incorporating precious stones or jade. The current long straight hair does not meet this requirement.
Question: Has the subject’s hairstyle been replaced with an ornate headpiece featuring intricate jade hairpins?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The background must be changed to an elegant study with classic Chinese scrolls. This implies a room setting with wooden furniture, hanging calligraphy or painting scrolls, and possibly bookshelves or incense burners. The original image has a plain neutral background, which must be replaced.
Question: Is the background now an elegant study room featuring at least one classic Chinese scroll or wall hanging?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The color palette must include rich reds, golds, and deep greens. These colors were dominant in Qing imperial aesthetics—reds for prosperity, gold for royalty, and deep greens for elegance and nature. The image must reflect these tones in clothing, accessories, and background.
Question: Are the dominant colors in the image rich reds, golds, and deep greens, consistent with the specified color palette?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: While the subject's appearance is being transformed, the instruction does not mention altering facial features or posture. Therefore, the subject's original facial structure, expression, and body position should remain recognizable and unchanged except for the addition of period-appropriate attire and accessories.
Question: Has the subject’s facial features and overall posture remained consistent with the original image, aside from the additions of costume and accessories?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
