      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies replacing the wings with crystal shards in opal and white shades. This requires removing the existing feathered wings and replacing them with crystalline structures that have an iridescent or opalescent quality, resembling natural gemstone fragments rather than organic feathers. The crystals should be large and prominent, positioned symmetrically behind the figure.",
      "question": "Are the wings replaced with large, angular crystal shards in shades of opal and white?",

      "thinking_process": "The hair must be transformed into golden leafy strands that are interwoven like a crown. This implies a change from natural hair texture to a stylized, botanical-like appearance—featuring golden hues and leaf-shaped elements arranged in a regal, crown-like pattern around the head. The transformation should not involve simple coloring but actual structural reconfiguration into plant-like forms.",

      "thinking_process": "The shirt must be changed to smooth velvet material while keeping its white color. Velvet is characterized by a soft, plush surface with a slight sheen and visible nap, different from the matte or cotton-like texture of a standard t-shirt. The shape and fit should remain consistent with the original.",
      "question": "Has the shirt been changed to a smooth velvet material while maintaining a white color?",

      "thinking_process": "The background must be a minimalist deep gray wall, meaning any previous environment (such as architectural details, lighting fixtures, or furniture) should be removed or obscured. The wall should be plain, uniform in color, and serve as a neutral backdrop to emphasize the figure's transformations.",
      "question": "Is the background a plain, deep gray wall with no visible objects or textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The figure’s core identity—posture, facial expression, and body orientation—should remain unchanged despite all visual modifications. This ensures continuity between the original and edited versions, confirming that only the specified elements were altered.",
      "question": "Has the figure’s facial expression, posture, and positioning remained unchanged from the original image?",

        "Yes",
