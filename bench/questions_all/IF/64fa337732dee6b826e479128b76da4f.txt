Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the woman into a chibi character, which implies a stylized, cartoonish figure with exaggerated features such as a large head relative to the body, simplified facial features, and small limbs. "Victorian-era" indicates that the character should retain period-appropriate clothing and accessories but in a chibi form. This transformation must be visually distinct from the original realistic portrait.
Question: Is the woman depicted as a chibi-style character with an oversized head and simplified proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The theme of a "fridge magnet collection" implies that the entire image should resemble a collectible itemâ€”small in scale, possibly with a glossy finish, and designed to be part of a series. This includes visual cues like a border or frame that suggests a magnet, and potentially a flat, two-dimensional appearance suitable for display on a refrigerator.
Question: Does the image have a design consistent with a collectible fridge magnet, such as a border or background suggesting it is a small, flat object?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The gown must be simplified into vibrant, oversized frills with lace detailing. This means the dress should no longer be realistic in proportion but instead feature exaggerated, playful ruffles and visible lace patterns. The color should be vivid, not muted.
Question: Is the gown rendered with oversized, vibrant frills and visible lace detailing?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Jewelry must be embellished with gold accents. This means any necklace, bracelets, rings, or earrings should now include prominent gold elements, possibly with shiny highlights or ornate designs consistent with Victorian fashion but enhanced for visual impact.
Question: Are all pieces of jewelry on the character adorned with noticeable gold accents?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Furniture must be modified into colorful, miniature forms. In the original image, there is a blue upholstered chair and a golden cushion. These should now appear smaller in scale, more stylized, and brightly colored to match the chibi and collectible theme.
Question: Is the furniture depicted in a colorful, miniature style consistent with a chibi-themed scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A pearl pattern must be introduced around the edge of the image to add aesthetic charm and uniformity. This implies a decorative border composed of evenly spaced pearls or bead-like elements encircling the entire image.
Question: Is there a decorative border made of pearls or pearl-like elements surrounding the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
