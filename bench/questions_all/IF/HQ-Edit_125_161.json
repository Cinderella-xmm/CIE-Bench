      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the spiral staircase into a serpent form. This involves replacing the entire structure of the stairs with a serpentine shape while maintaining the spatial flow and curvature of the original staircase. The transformation must be complete—no part of the original stair should remain visible.",
      "question": "Has the spiral staircase been fully replaced by a serpent-shaped form that follows the same helical path?",

This implies that the segmented, descending nature of the stairs should now be represented by the coiled or segmented segments of the serpent’s body, maintaining the downward progression.",

      "question": "Is there a serpent’s head positioned at the uppermost point of the spiral, featuring two distinct luminescent gem-like eyes?",

The instruction requires embedding a marble-like texture onto the serpent’s body to maintain visual consistency with the original materials. This includes veining, subtle shading, and a smooth, polished appearance.",
