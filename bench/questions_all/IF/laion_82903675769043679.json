      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the English manor-style house into a cubist structure. Cubism is characterized by fragmented, angular forms and multiple perspectives. The transformation must replace the original architectural style with geometric abstraction using vivid colors. This involves breaking down the buildingâ€™s walls, roof, and chimneys into non-representational planes.",
      "question": "Has the English manor-style house been replaced with a structure composed of fragmented, colorful geometric planes consistent with cubist art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The brickwork of the original house must be broken into distinct, vibrant geometric shapes. This implies that the traditional red brick texture should no longer be visible but instead replaced with bold, angular segments in varied colors, maintaining the overall form but altering its material appearance.",
      "question": "Are the original brick surfaces of the house replaced with vibrant, non-uniform geometric planes rather than realistic masonry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The crowd of spectators must be transformed from realistic human figures into abstract, faceless forms. These should lack facial features and be simplified into basic shapes or silhouettes, scattered across the scene without recognizable identities.",
      "question": "Have all individuals in the crowd been rendered as abstract, faceless, and scattered forms devoid of detailed features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The grass in the image must now display a checkered pattern. This means the green turf should have a regular grid of alternating light and dark squares or rectangles, replacing the natural texture of the lawn.",
      "question": "Does the grass surface feature a visible checkered pattern overlaying the entire green area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The water reflection must be altered from a realistic mirror image into prismatic shards. This suggests the reflection should appear broken into angular, colored fragments resembling stained glass or crystal refractions, rather than a smooth mirrored surface.",
      "question": "Has the water reflection been transformed into a series of prismatic, angular shards that distort and fragment the image of the house and surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
