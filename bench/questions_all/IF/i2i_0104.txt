Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly mentions adding "Warm Home." This text addition needs to be confirmed for presence.

Q3:
Thinking process: Similar to "Warm Home," the instruction also specifies the addition of "Adopt Love." The presence of this text needs verification.

Q4:
Thinking process: The placement and visibility of the texts are critical to ensure they serve their purpose effectively in the poster. 
Question: Are both "Warm Home" and "Adopt Love" clearly visible in the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: While not explicitly stated, a pet adoption poster often includes a clear and appealing depiction of the pet. The cat should remain the focal point.
