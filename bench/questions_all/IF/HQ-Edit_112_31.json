      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the horse into a chibi-style plush toy. Chibi style is characterized by a disproportionately large head relative to the body, simplified features, and a cute, cartoonish appearance. This requires evaluating whether the horse’s proportions have been altered to match this style.",
      "question": "Is the horse's head significantly larger than its body, consistent with chibi-style proportions?",

      "question": "Does the horse have an unusually large, fluffy, and exaggerated mane that appears soft and plush-like?",

      "thinking_process": "The material is specified as soft brown fabric with white patches. This means the horse’s body should visually resemble textile material (e.g., stitched or textured surface), not realistic fur, and include distinct white areas on a brown base.",
      "question": "Is the horse’s body made of a fabric-like material with visible brown and white patches, resembling soft textile?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The legs should be short and stubby to enhance cuteness, which is a hallmark of chibi design. This involves assessing limb proportion—shorter than natural horse legs, possibly with rounded ends.",
      "question": "Are the horse’s legs noticeably short and stubby compared to its body size, contributing to a cute, toy-like appearance?",
