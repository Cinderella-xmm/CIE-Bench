Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the entire statue and base to be enclosed within a glass dome. This implies a transparent spherical or domed structure visibly enclosing the scene. The presence of a glass dome is essential for transforming the original outdoor sculpture into a miniature display.
Question: Is the statue and its base fully enclosed within a transparent glass dome?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The statue must be reimagined as a sleek, metallic 3D figure. This means the original stone appearance should be replaced with a reflective, modern metallic texture, possibly chrome or steel-like, indicating a transformation in material and style.
Question: Has the statue been transformed into a sleek, metallic 3D figure with a reflective surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the scene inside the dome should include diminutive trees with translucent leaves. These trees must be smaller than natural scale and have a see-through or glowing leaf quality, suggesting a fantasy or artistic rendering.
Question: Are there small-scale trees with translucent or semi-transparent leaves surrounding the metallic figure inside the dome?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Engraved mini plaques with historical texts must be added to the base. These should be visible, tiny in size relative to the miniature scale, and contain legible text resembling historical inscriptions, distinguishing them from the original plaque.
Question: Are there additional small engraved plaques with historical text visible on the base of the miniature scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The dome stand must have a polished stone finish with delicate vine patterns, conveying elegance and heritage. This means the base supporting the dome should appear smooth, refined, and decorated with intricate vine carvings or etchings.
Question: Does the stand beneath the glass dome feature a polished stone surface with delicate vine patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
