Question: Is there a 3D chibi-style figure emerging from the kayak?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The illusion of the character crossing the kayak’s edge is crucial. This involves verifying if the character appears to be transitioning from the kayak into the real-world environment.
