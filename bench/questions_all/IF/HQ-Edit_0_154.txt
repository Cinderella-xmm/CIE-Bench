Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly requires transforming the image into an educational infographic. This implies a complete shift from a photographic representation to a structured, informative layout with clear headings and organized content. The presence of a title and structured sections is essential.
Question: Is the image now an educational infographic with a clear title "Currencies of the World" displayed at the top?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies using a clean, modern design. This refers to visual elements such as minimal clutter, balanced spacing, sans-serif typography, and a professional layout. These are observable features that distinguish a modern infographic from a photo or artistic rendering.
Question: Does the design use a clean, modern aesthetic with minimal visual clutter and balanced layout?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction mandates specific section headings for the currencies: “USD,” “QAR,” and “INR.” These must be clearly visible and correctly associated with the respective banknotes shown in the original image.
Question: Are there distinct labeled sections titled “USD,” “QAR,” and “INR” corresponding to the visible banknotes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The original wallet must be transformed into a schematic blueprint style—this means replacing the realistic leather wallet with a line-drawn, technical-style illustration showing internal structure. This change is central to the transformation.
Question: Has the wallet been replaced with a schematic blueprint-style drawing featuring clean lines and minimalist form?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Annotations next to each currency slot are required. These should provide explanatory text or labels indicating the currency type, denomination, or origin, directly tied to the blueprint representation.
Question: Are there annotations placed next to each currency slot in the blueprint, identifying or describing the currency?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for chart data illustrating exchange rates. This means including a graph, bar chart, or line chart showing relative values between USD, QAR, and INR, which must be visually integrated into the infographic.
Question: Is there a chart or graph included in the image that displays exchange rate data among USD, QAR, and INR?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: Icons representing each country’s economy are required. These could include symbols like oil pumps (for Qatar), agriculture/IT (for India), or manufacturing (for USA). Their inclusion is necessary to fulfill the educational intent.
Question: Are there icons present that represent the economies of the USA, Qatar, and India respectively?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
