      "question": "Has the bottle cap been replaced with a stylized rose-shaped element that has a glossy gold finish?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for a minimalist gold font logo placed vertically along the side of the bottle. This requires a text element in gold color, using simple typography (no ornate or decorative fonts), positioned vertically (top to bottom) on the bottle’s body.",
