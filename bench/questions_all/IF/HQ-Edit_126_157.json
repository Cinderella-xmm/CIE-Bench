      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the entire scene into a miniature shadow box diorama. This implies a shift from a realistic photograph to a crafted, enclosed 3D display with visible layers and a framed boundary. The core feature is the presence of a diorama structure.",
      "question": "Is the image presented within a visible hand-carved wooden frame that encloses the scene?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the boat, water, and hills should be represented as layered 3D cutouts. This means each element should appear as distinct, physically separated planes, mimicking paper or material layers in a diorama.",
      "question": "Are the boat, water, and hills depicted as separate, layered cutout elements rather than a continuous photographic scene?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The boat must have aged wood textures to reflect the material used in traditional dioramas. This refers to visible grain, wear, and weathering effects on the boatâ€™s surface.",
      "question": "Does the boat exhibit aged wood textures such as cracks, grain patterns, and weathered surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The distant hills must be rendered using soft, pastel blue gradients to match the requested aesthetic. This involves color tone and smooth transitions, not sharp or naturalistic mountain colors.",
      "question": "Are the distant hills rendered in soft, pastel blue gradients instead of realistic green or gray tones?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for tiny, delicate droplets etched on clear glass to simulate water ripples. This implies a transparent layer over the water surface with fine, engraved-like details resembling ripples.",
      "question": "Are there visible, delicate droplet-like etchings on a transparent layer above the water surface to mimic ripples?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Depth perception must be enhanced through the use of layered cutouts and possibly perspective cues. In a diorama, this is achieved by separating foreground, midground, and background elements into distinct planes.",
      "question": "Do the foreground (boat), midground (water), and background (hills) appear as distinct, physically separated layers contributing to depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
