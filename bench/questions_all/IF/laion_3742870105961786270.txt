Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire statue into a perfume bottle design, which implies that the overall form should resemble a bottle. This includes restructuring the figure's body to mimic a bottle silhouette while retaining thematic elements from the original statue.
Question: Has the overall form of the statue been reshaped into a recognizable perfume bottle structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The jug carried by the figure in the original image must be transformed into an ornate glass stopper. This involves changing its material appearance (to glass), adding decorative details typical of stoppers, and positioning it at the top of the bottle form.
Question: Has the jug been replaced with an ornate glass stopper positioned at the top of the bottle?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The flowing robe must be reimagined as the main body of the bottle. This means the fabric draping should now define the contour and curvature of a bottle, maintaining fluidity but aligning with a vessel-like shape.
Question: Has the robe been transformed into a smooth, elegant bottle-shaped body?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A goose-shaped charm is required as a decorative accessory. This implies a small, distinct object shaped like a goose, likely attached to or near the bottle, possibly resembling a pendant or embellishment.
Question: Is there a clearly defined goose-shaped charm present as a decorative element on or near the bottle?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Earthy tones with gold accents are specified. This means the primary colors should include browns, tans, ochres, etc., with visible gold highlights such as trim, engravings, or decorative lines.
Question: Are the dominant colors earthy tones (e.g., brown, tan, terracotta) with visible gold accents?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Grapevine patterns must be engraved across the bottle surface. These should be visible as etched or embossed designs resembling vines and grapes, consistent with vintage or classical aesthetics.
Question: Are grapevine patterns visibly engraved or embossed across the surface of the bottle?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The final requirement is a detailed cardboard packaging with classical art motifs and a soft matte finish. This implies the presence of a box surrounding or accompanying the bottle, decorated with classical imagery (e.g., Greek columns, mythological figures, scrollwork), and having a non-reflective surface texture.
Question: Is there a cardboard package surrounding or adjacent to the bottle that features classical art motifs and has a soft matte finish?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
