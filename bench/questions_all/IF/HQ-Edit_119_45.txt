- Transform the image into a Steampunk-inspired hieratic sculpture
- Replace traditional elements with intricate brass gears and polished copper, while maintaining the headdress shape
- Equip the figure with mechanical wings adorned with emerald accents
- Reimagine the collar with ornate clockwork designs
- Add small steam exhaust pipes to the collar for texture
- Include subtle wisps of vapor emanating from the steam exhaust pipes to enhance the dynamic steampunk aesthetic
- Maintain the overall structure and proportions of the original hieratic form (e.g., head shape, facial features, headdress silhouette)

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the image into a Steampunk-inspired hieratic sculpture. This implies replacing traditional Egyptian materials and motifs with industrial elements such as brass, copper, gears, and mechanical components, while preserving the iconic silhouette and symbolic posture of a pharaoh’s funerary mask. The core visual identity must shift from ancient Egyptian to steampunk, which includes metallic textures, mechanical details, and Victorian-era industrial aesthetics.
Question: Has the overall style of the sculpture been transformed into a steampunk aesthetic, featuring industrial elements like gears, copper, and brass?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies replacing traditional elements with intricate brass gears and polished copper while maintaining the headdress shape. This means the nemes headdress must retain its striped form and general outline but be constructed using steampunk materials—specifically brass and copper—and integrated with gear-like structures.
Question: Are the stripes of the headdress now composed of or replaced by intricate brass gears and polished copper elements, while preserving the original shape and silhouette?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly requires equipping the figure with mechanical wings adorned with emerald accents. This means visible wings must be added to the figure, constructed in a mechanical or clockwork style consistent with steampunk design, and decorated with green gem-like emerald highlights.
Question: Does the figure have mechanical wings attached to its back or shoulders, featuring visible gears, metal framework, and emerald-colored accents?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The collar must be reimagined with ornate clockwork designs, indicating that the traditional broad collar should now include interlocking gears, cogs, dials, or other mechanical patterns typical of steampunk artistry. The design must reflect precision engineering and complexity.
Question: Has the collar been redesigned with detailed clockwork patterns, including gears, cogs, or other mechanical components, replacing the original decorative elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies adding small steam exhaust pipes to the collar and including subtle wisps of vapor. This means there should be visible pipe-like protrusions on the collar (small in size) from which faint plumes of steam or vapor are emerging, contributing to the dynamic, functional appearance of the steampunk machine.
Question: Are there small steam exhaust pipes visible on the collar, with subtle wisps of vapor or steam emanating from them?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
