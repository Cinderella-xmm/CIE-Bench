Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the bicycle into a steampunk insect creature. This implies a complete morphological shift from a standard bicycle to a biomechanical entity resembling an insect, with visible features such as segmented limbs and metallic textures consistent with steampunk aesthetics.
Question: Has the overall form of the bicycle been transformed into a creature-like structure resembling a steampunk insect?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The frame must be reimagined as an exoskeleton with visible cogwheel joints, indicating mechanical articulation points that mimic jointed limbs. This involves replacing smooth metal tubing with segmented, riveted, or gear-integrated sections.
Question: Are the frame components replaced with an exoskeleton structure featuring visible cogwheel joints?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The seat must be reshaped into an ornate carapace, which implies a hard, protective shell-like structure, likely with decorative patterns, ridges, or embossed designs typical of insect backs.
Question: Has the bicycle seat been transformed into a detailed, ornate carapace resembling an insect's back?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The wheels must be converted into hinged, mechanical legs, meaning they are no longer circular but articulated limbs capable of movement, possibly with pistons, hinges, or jointed segments.
Question: Have both wheels been replaced with hinged, mechanical leg structures instead of traditional circular wheels?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Copper-tinted wingtips must be added along the top bar, suggesting elongated, thin, metallic extensions resembling wings, colored in copper tones, positioned along the upper part of the frame.
Question: Are there copper-colored, wing-like extensions attached along the top bar of the bicycle?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Antique clock faces displaying mysterious runes must be integrated at the handlebars. This means the handlebar area should feature clock mechanisms with aged appearance, and the dials should show non-standard symbols or runes rather than numbers.
Question: Are there antique-style clock faces with mysterious runes displayed at the handlebar area?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
