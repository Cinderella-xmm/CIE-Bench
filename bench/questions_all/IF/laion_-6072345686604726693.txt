Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire Hagia Sophia into a mythical creature-like entity. This implies a complete structural reimagining where architectural elements are repurposed as biological features. The core transformation must be visible in the overall silhouette and form of the structure.
Question: Has the Hagia Sophia been transformed into a creature-like figure with a distinct body, head, or limb-like structures?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The metallic domes are specified to form the wings. This means the smaller domes around the central structure should be reshaped into wing-like extensions made of metal, possibly with reflective surfaces and angular geometry resembling feathers or armor plating.
Question: Do the smaller domes on the sides of the structure appear as large, metallic, wing-like appendages extending outward?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The minarets are explicitly instructed to morph into long, elegant legs. This implies they are no longer vertical towers but elongated, jointed, or curved structures supporting the creature from below, likely positioned at the base of the structure.
Question: Have the four minarets been replaced with long, slender, leg-like structures that support the body of the creature?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Intricate Byzantine patterns glowing with mystical energy must be present across the surface of the structure. These should resemble traditional ornamental designs (such as interlacing motifs, crosses, geometric patterns) but emit light or have a luminous aura suggesting magical energy.
Question: Are there glowing, intricate patterns resembling Byzantine art covering parts of the structureâ€™s surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The central dome must be replaced by a large, ever-watchful jewel that reflects cosmic wonders. This means the original dome is gone, replaced by a spherical or faceted gem-like object that appears to float or be embedded in the structure, showing reflections of stars, galaxies, or nebulae.
Question: Has the central dome been replaced with a large, jewel-like object that displays cosmic imagery such as stars, nebulae, or galaxies?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
