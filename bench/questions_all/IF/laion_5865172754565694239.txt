- Add a cheeky, expressive face on the frame near the handlebars
- Add cartoon-style limbs emerging from the hubs (front and rear wheels)
- Add dynamic motion lines to emphasize speed
- Transform the red frame into a hero suit appearance (e.g., with stylized patterns, superhero-like design elements)
- Overlay comic-style speed sound effects such as “Vroom!” and “Zoom!”
- Maintain the original bike structure while applying animated character transformation
- Ensure all added elements are in a lively, comic book style (including bold outlines, exaggerated features, vibrant colors)

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires adding a facial expression to the bike frame near the handlebars. This implies a visible, cartoonish face—such as eyes, eyebrows, and a mouth—drawn or superimposed on the frame area close to the stem and handlebars. The face should be expressive and "cheeky," suggesting playful or mischievous features like a smirk or raised eyebrow.
Question: Is there a visible, cartoon-style face with expressive features (eyes, mouth, etc.) drawn on the frame near the handlebars?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies cartoon-style limbs emerging from the hubs. This means arms or legs should extend from the front and/or rear wheel hubs in a stylized, exaggerated manner typical of animated characters. These limbs must be clearly attached to the hub area and not just random lines.
Question: Are there cartoon-style limbs (arms or legs) visibly extending from the front and/or rear wheel hubs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Dynamic motion lines are required to convey speed. These are typically diagonal streaks or wavy lines around the moving parts (like wheels or body) in comic art. They should be present around the bike to suggest rapid movement.
Question: Are there dynamic motion lines (such as streaks or curved lines) surrounding the bike or its wheels to indicate speed?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The red frame must be transformed into a hero suit. This implies that the frame’s color or design now includes superhero-like elements such as a cape outline, armor patterns, glowing accents, or emblem details, maintaining the red base but enhancing it with costume-like features.
Question: Has the red frame been redesigned to resemble a superhero suit, including visual elements like patterns, textures, or symbols associated with a hero costume?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for comic-style sound effects like “Vroom!” and “Zoom!” These must appear as text bubbles or stylized lettering in a comic book font, positioned dynamically around the bike to enhance the sense of action.
Question: Are there comic-style sound effect texts such as “Vroom!” or “Zoom!” overlaid on the image in a stylized, bold font typical of comic books?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The overall style must be consistent with a lively comic page scene. This includes bold outlines, bright colors, exaggerated proportions, and a sense of action. All edits should contribute to a cohesive animated character interpretation rather than a static bike.
Question: Does the entire image exhibit a comic book aesthetic, including exaggerated features, bold lines, vibrant colors, and dynamic composition consistent with a lively animated character?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
