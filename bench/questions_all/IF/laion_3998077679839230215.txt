Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the outfit should be transformed into six distinct chibi-style fridge magnets. This requires verifying whether the edited image contains exactly six separate objects, each representing one element of the original outfit or background. The term "chibi" implies simplified, cartoonish proportions with large heads and small bodies, which must be visible in each magnet.
Question: Are there exactly six separate chibi-style illustrations, each depicting one of the specified elements (blouse, lehenga, dupatta, jewelry, bangles, background)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states that each magnet must have a vibrant glossy finish. This means each object should reflect light, appear shiny, and have high color saturation to convey a polished, plastic-like surface typical of fridge magnets.
Question: Do all six magnets exhibit a vibrant, glossy surface with visible reflections or shine?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Rounded edges are a required physical attribute of the magnets, ensuring they are safe and visually consistent with typical fridge magnets. This can be observed by checking if the corners of each magnet are smoothly curved rather than sharp.
Question: Do all six magnets have clearly rounded edges instead of sharp corners?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that each magnet must represent one distinct element from the original image. These include the blouse, lehenga, dupatta, jewelry, bangles, and background pattern. Therefore, each magnet must visually correspond to one of these specific components without merging or omitting any.
Question: Does each of the six magnets accurately depict one of the following: the embellished purple blouse, the intricate lehenga with floral patterns, the red dupatta, the traditional jewelry, the silver bangles, or the ornate background wall pattern?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The term "chibi-style" refers to a specific art style characterized by exaggerated proportions (e.g., large heads, small bodies), simplified features, and a cute aesthetic. This must be applied consistently across all six magnets to meet the stylistic requirement.
Question: Are all six magnets rendered in a chibi art style, featuring exaggerated proportions such as large heads and simplified facial features?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction implies that the magnets are meant to be collectible and playful. This suggests they should be arranged in a way that highlights their individuality and appeal, such as being displayed separately or in a grid layout. Additionally, they should not retain the full-scale realism of the original image but instead be stylized and compact.
Question: Are the six magnets displayed as individual, standalone items arranged in a way that suggests they are part of a collectible set, rather than a single composite image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
