      "thinking_process": "The style requirement is \"lush, detailed botanical illustration,\" which refers to a highly detailed, naturalistic rendering of plant life and animals with emphasis on texture, leaf structure, and organic forms. This means the tree and foliage should exhibit intricate details resembling scientific illustrations.",
