      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the boat and riders into a mythical ocean guardian creature. This means the original silhouette must no longer resemble a jet ski or boat but instead be reimagined as a fantastical being with biological or mythological features. The transformation must be complete and recognizable as a creature.",
      "question": "Is the silhouetted boat and riders replaced by a mythical ocean guardian creature that is clearly distinguishable from a regular boat?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies creating a shell-like body using sunset hues. This implies the creature’s main body should have a rounded, protective structure resembling a shell, and its coloration must reflect the warm tones present in the sky—such as orange, red, and yellow—matching the ambient lighting.",
      "question": "Does the creature feature a shell-like body composed of sunset-colored hues (orange, red, yellow)?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires coral-like spires to be added across the creature’s back. These should resemble natural coral formations—branching, organic, and elevated—and be integrated into the creature’s design. Their presence must be visible and stylistically consistent with marine life.",
      "question": "Are there coral-like spires visibly extending along the back of the creature?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The passengers must be transformed into glowing sea guardian spirits. This means they should no longer appear as human figures but as ethereal, luminous entities—possibly translucent, emitting light, and styled in a way that suggests spiritual or magical nature.",
      "question": "Have the riders been replaced with glowing, spirit-like figures that emit light and resemble sea guardians?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The water trail behind the boat must be replaced with luminescent wave patterns that mimic the sky’s gradient. This involves replacing the white wake with flowing, glowing waves that transition through similar colors as the sunset—orange, red, and yellow—and appear to glow softly in the darkening water.",
      "question": "Has the water trail been replaced with glowing, wave-like patterns that match the color gradient of the sunset sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The original position and composition of the boat within the frame must be preserved. Even though the object has changed, it should remain in the same general area—centered in the lower third of the image, moving toward the horizon—to maintain visual balance and continuity with the original scene.",
      "question": "Is the mythical creature positioned in the same location as the original boat, near the center of the lower half of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
