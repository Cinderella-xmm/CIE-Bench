Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the pie to be personified as a fussy old librarian. This implies anthropomorphic features such as facial expression, limbs, and clothing consistent with a librarian character. The presence of a face, arms, and a stern demeanor should be observable.
Question: Is the pie depicted with human-like features such as a face and limbs, resembling a fussy old librarian?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The knife must be transformed into a feather pen, which means it should no longer look like a kitchen knife but instead resemble a quill pen, likely held in the pie's hand. The shape and texture should reflect that of a writing instrument.
Question: Has the knife been visually altered to resemble a feather pen, and is it being held by the pie character?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The lattice design of the pie crust must be repurposed as a patterned apron. This means the crisscross pattern should appear on the lower part of the pie character, mimicking an apron worn over a body, while retaining its original structure.
Question: Is the lattice crust pattern visible on the pie character as a patterned apron, draped over its lower half?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The comic strip must contain two scenes. Scene 1 must include the text “Hush! Respect the quiet crust.” and show surrounding pastries that are chattering. These elements must be present and legible.
Question: Does Scene 1 display the text “Hush! Respect the quiet crust.” and feature other pastry characters appearing to chatter?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Scene 2 must include the text “You’ll get a slice of silence!” and depict the feather pen (formerly the knife) hovering above the pie in a disciplinary gesture, suggesting authority and warning.
Question: Does Scene 2 contain the text “You’ll get a slice of silence!” and show the feather pen positioned above the pie in a stern, hovering manner?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The overall image must be structured as a comic strip with at least two panels. This requires clear separation between scenes, possibly through borders or layout, and sequential storytelling.
Question: Is the image composed as a two-panel comic strip with distinct scene divisions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The style must be whimsical and cartoonish, not realistic. This includes exaggerated features, stylized characters, and expressive lines typical of comic art.
Question: Is the artwork rendered in a cartoonish, illustrative style rather than photorealistic?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
