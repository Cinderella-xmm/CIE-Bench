      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the entire scene must be transformed into a diorama housed within a wooden shadow box frame. This implies visible framing elements such as a wooden border, glass front, or shadow box structure enclosing the scene. The presence of these physical boundaries is essential to confirm the transformation into a diorama.",
      "question": "Is the scene enclosed within a visible wooden shadow box frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The tree must be miniaturized and given enhanced 3D texture, meaning it should appear smaller in scale relative to the original and have detailed surface textures (such as bark ridges, depth cues, or shading) that suggest three-dimensionality. This is distinct from just scaling down without textural enhancement.",
      "question": "Has the tree been scaled down in size and rendered with enhanced 3D surface texture (e.g., visible bark details, depth, shading)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires adding \"delicate, multi-colored flower patches\" beneath the tree. This means there should be visibly distinct clusters of small flowers in multiple colors (not just green grass), arranged in patches on the ground around the base of the tree.",
      "question": "Are there visible, distinct patches of multi-colored flowers (e.g., pink, yellow, blue, red) beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Layered painted backdrops are required to create depth. This suggests the background consists of multiple painted planes (e.g., foreground, midground, background layers) with different perspectives or tones, giving an illusion of depth typical in dioramas.",
      "question": "Does the background consist of multiple layered painted surfaces that create a sense of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Tiny, intricate cloud figures suspended from thin wires must be present. These are not regular clouds but miniature sculpted or painted clouds attached to fine wires, suggesting they are part of a constructed display. Their suspension implies visible wire supports.",
      "question": "Are there small, detailed cloud shapes visibly suspended by thin wires above or within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall display must convey a playful, immersive, and whimsical, dreamlike essence. While subjective, this can be evaluated through concrete visual cues such as exaggerated proportions, soft lighting, surreal elements (e.g., floating clouds), pastel tones, or stylized features that deviate from realism.",
      "question": "Does the image include surreal or stylized elements (e.g., floating clouds, soft glow, pastel hues) that contribute to a whimsical and dreamlike atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
