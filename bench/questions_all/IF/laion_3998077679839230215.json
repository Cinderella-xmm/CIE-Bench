This requires verifying whether the edited image contains exactly six separate objects, each representing one element of the original outfit or background. The term \"chibi\" implies simplified, cartoonish proportions with large heads and small bodies, which must be visible in each magnet.",
      "question": "Are there exactly six separate chibi-style illustrations, each depicting one of the specified elements (blouse, lehenga, dupatta, jewelry, bangles, background)?",

These include the blouse, lehenga, dupatta, jewelry, bangles, and background pattern. Therefore, each magnet must visually correspond to one of these specific components without merging or omitting any.",
      "question": "Does each of the six magnets accurately depict one of the following: the embellished purple blouse, the intricate lehenga with floral patterns, the red dupatta, the traditional jewelry, the silver bangles, or the ornate background wall pattern?",

This suggests they should be arranged in a way that highlights their individuality and appeal, such as being displayed separately or in a grid layout. Additionally, they should not retain the full-scale realism of the original image but instead be stylized and compact.",
      "question": "Are the six magnets displayed as individual, standalone items arranged in a way that suggests they are part of a collectible set, rather than a single composite image?",
