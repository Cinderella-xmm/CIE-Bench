This implies a polished, display-ready appearance with attention to detail, materials, and presentation quality. A premium collectible typically includes refined textures and finishes, such as brushed metal and matte surfaces, which are explicitly mentioned. The key observable feature is whether the robot exhibits these material properties.",
