Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires animating the monarch butterfly as a maestro conducting an orchestra. This implies visible motion or implied movement, particularly in the antennae acting as a baton. The butterfly must appear engaged in conducting, not static.
Question: Does the butterfly have its antennae positioned or depicted in a way that suggests motion resembling a conductor's baton?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The wings must contain subtle sheet music patterns embedded within the orange hues. This means musical notation (e.g., staves, notes) should be visible but integrated into the wing design without overpowering the natural pattern.
Question: Are there faint sheet music patterns, such as musical notes or staff lines, visible within the orange areas of the butterfly’s wings?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The surrounding flowers must be animated and expressive, swaying in rhythm. Their petals should resemble musical notes. This requires visual cues such as curved or shaped petals mimicking note forms and dynamic positioning suggesting motion.
Question: Do the flowers around the butterfly have petals shaped like musical notes or arranged in a way that suggests rhythmic swaying?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The flowers must use pastel tones to create harmony. Pastel colors include soft pinks, lavenders, blues, yellows, etc., avoiding bright or saturated hues.
Question: Are the flowers rendered in soft, pastel color tones rather than vivid or saturated colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The title "Monarch’s Garden Symphony" must be present in elegant, flowing script. This refers to a cursive, artistic font style that is decorative and readable.
Question: Is the title "Monarch’s Garden Symphony" displayed in a flowing, elegant script font?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The butterfly and flowers must be arranged in a circular composition to create dynamic flow. This means elements are positioned along a circular path or arc, forming a cohesive loop.
Question: Are the butterfly and surrounding flowers arranged in a circular or semi-circular layout?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The image must have a square aspect ratio, meaning the width and height are equal. This can be verified by comparing the dimensions.
Question: Is the image in a square format (equal width and height)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: The overall atmosphere must be enchanting and dreamy, conveying harmony and rhythm. This is reflected in soft lighting, gentle gradients, blurred backgrounds, or ethereal effects.
Question: Does the image feature soft lighting, gentle shadows, or glowing effects that contribute to a dreamy and harmonious atmosphere?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
