      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the bust into a steampunk-inspired sculpture. This implies introducing mechanical, industrial, and Victorian-era elements such as gears, brass components, and intricate metalwork. A successful edit must visibly shift the aesthetic from classical marble to steampunk, which includes textures and materials consistent with that genre.",
      "question": "Has the overall style of the bust been transformed into a steampunk-inspired design, incorporating mechanical or industrial elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The hair is explicitly instructed to be modified into \"cogwheel curls.\" This means each curl should resemble a gear or cog in shape and texture, possibly with teeth or mechanical details. This is a specific visual transformation requiring detailed alteration of the original curly hair.",
      "question": "Have the curls in the hair been replaced with gear-like or cogwheel-shaped structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The original drapery is made of fabric; the instruction requires replacing it with metallic fabrics that include rivets and tubes. This involves changing material appearance (from soft cloth to rigid metal) and adding structural details like rivets and tubing.",
      "question": "Has the drapery been replaced with metallic fabric that includes visible rivets and tubular elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The base of the bust must be adorned with vintage watch parts and gears. These should be clearly visible and integrated into the base structure, not just background decorations. This includes elements like clock hands, springs, cogs, or watch faces.",
      "question": "Are vintage watch parts and gears visibly incorporated into the base of the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "A monocle mechanism must be added to the blurred area (the right eye), implying a mechanical lens or device resembling a steampunk-style eyepiece. It should appear functional and integrated with the face, using materials consistent with the bronze and copper theme.",
      "question": "Is there a mechanical monocle device visible over the right eye area of the bust?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The color scheme must maintain harmony with polished bronze and copper tones. This means the dominant colors should be warm metallics—shades of gold, brown, orange, and reddish-brown—rather than white or off-white. The entire sculpture should reflect this palette.",
      "question": "Has the color scheme of the bust been changed to predominantly feature polished bronze and copper tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
