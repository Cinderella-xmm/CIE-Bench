Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the gnome sculpture into a rustic garden product package design. This implies the overall composition should resemble a product packaging layout, not just a standalone sculpture. Key indicators include framing elements, branding placement, and a commercial presentation style.
Question: Is the entire image presented as a product package design with a structured layout resembling a retail item?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The title "Garden Gnome Blossoms" must be visibly present in the design as part of the branding. This is an explicit textual requirement that needs to be checked for presence and legibility.
Question: Is the text "Garden Gnome Blossoms" clearly visible and legible somewhere on the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The original basket held by the gnome must be replaced with a seed packet display. This means the object in the gnome’s hands should now resemble a seed packet—typically rectangular with printed labeling, possibly including images or text related to seeds.
Question: Has the woven basket been replaced with a seed packet display that resembles a typical seed packet (e.g., flat, labeled, rectangular)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The flowers previously held by the gnome must be swapped for plantable seed bombs. These are typically small, round, compact objects resembling balls of soil or compost, often textured to look like natural earth.
Question: Are the flowers in the gnome’s hands replaced with round, textured objects resembling plantable seed bombs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Faux soil and botanical illustrations must be added around the base of the gnome to suggest a garden setting and reinforce the theme. These elements should be visually distinct from the original surface and include textures like dirt, leaves, or plant outlines.
Question: Are there visible elements resembling faux soil and botanical illustrations (such as leaf patterns or soil texture) around the base of the gnome?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies adding detailed texture graphics that resemble earthy materials to enhance the nature essence. This includes visual textures such as bark, moss, clay, or rough soil surfaces applied across the design.
Question: Are there visible earthy-textured graphics (such as rough soil, bark, or moss-like patterns) integrated into the design to enhance the natural, rustic feel?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
