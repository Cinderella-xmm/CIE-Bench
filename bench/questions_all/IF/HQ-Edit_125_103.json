The new form must be clearly cylindrical, not just modified but fundamentally reshaped.",
      "question": "Is the teapot now a cylindrical container instead of its original rounded shape?",

      "question": "Are the teacups redesigned as nested stackable units, each with a decorative lid?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for branding across the top with Japanese calligraphy.

The calligraphy must be legible and stylistically appropriate (e.g., brushstroke style).",
      "question": "Is there Japanese calligraphy displayed across the top of the packaging design?",

      "thinking_process": "The final presentation must be on a flat white surface to achieve a refined, elegant look. This implies the background is plain white, with no textured matting or wooden flooring visible. The entire product must appear isolated and clean, emphasizing minimalism and elegance.",
      "question": "Is the entire tea set packaging presented on a flat white surface with no other background elements?",
