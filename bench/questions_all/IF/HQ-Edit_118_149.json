      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies one sticker with \"softened pastel colors emphasizing grace.\" This refers to a color palette dominated by gentle, muted tones (e.g., light pinks, lavenders, soft blues) and smooth gradients, avoiding harsh contrasts or sharp lines.",
      "question": "Does one of the stickers use a pastel color scheme with soft gradients and gentle tones to convey grace?",

This suggests that parts of the dancer’s leg or surrounding area are segmented or broken into movable pieces, allowing for visual depth and interactivity in the sticker design.",
      "question": "Are there visible detachable or segmented sections around the dancer's leg in at least one of the stickers to enable dynamic layering?",
