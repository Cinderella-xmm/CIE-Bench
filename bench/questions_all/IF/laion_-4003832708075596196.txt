Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the tree trunk into arms and legs. This means the central trunk must be restructured into limb-like forms resembling human limbs, while still maintaining connection to the branches and overall tree structure.
Question: Has the tree trunk been reshaped into distinct arm and leg forms?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating leaf-faced heads using autumn leaves as faces. This implies that some of the maple leaves should be stylized to resemble faces with eyes, mouths, or other facial features.
Question: Are there leaf-shaped elements positioned as heads with cartoonish facial features?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for cartoonish facial expressions. These should be clearly visible and exaggerated in style, such as smiling, winking, or surprised looks, drawn directly onto the leaf faces.
Question: Do the leaf faces display visible cartoonish facial expressions (e.g., eyes, mouth, eyebrows)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Seasonal accessories like hats and scarves are required to enhance the festive theme. These should be visibly attached to the anthropomorphized tree characters and match the autumnal aesthetic.
Question: Are hats and scarves present on the anthropomorphic tree characters?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Whimsical text bubbles containing Thanksgiving greetings must be added around the characters. These should appear as speech or thought bubbles with readable text such as “Happy Thanksgiving” or similar festive messages.
Question: Are there text bubbles with Thanksgiving greetings placed around the characters?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The original image has a thin border framing the tree illustration. The instruction requires maintaining this layout, so the new elements must remain inside the same rectangular border.
Question: Is the entire illustration, including characters and text bubbles, contained within the original border?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The original autumn color palette includes orange, yellow, red, and brown. The instruction requires maintaining this palette, so no colors outside this range should dominate the new design.
Question: Are all colors used in the illustration consistent with the autumn palette (orange, yellow, red, brown)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: The original card includes the text "Happy Thanksgiving" below the image. The instruction does not mention removing it, so it must remain present and unaltered.
Question: Is the text "Happy Thanksgiving" still visible below the illustration?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
