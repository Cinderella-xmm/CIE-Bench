Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the ballerina into a classical Greek sculpture. This implies replacing her human appearance with a stone-like form, including facial features, body proportions, and surface texture consistent with ancient marble statues. The transformation must preserve the overall silhouette but change material and style.
Question: Is the ballerina depicted as a stone sculpture rather than a living person?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies adding intricate robes. In classical Greek sculpture, garments are typically draped with folds and detailed fabric patterns that reflect gravity and movement. These robes should be visibly layered and sculpted, not modern ballet attire.
Question: Are the ballerina's garments replaced with intricately folded, draping robes characteristic of classical Greek attire?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: A stylized laurel wreath is explicitly mentioned. Laurel wreaths were symbolic in ancient Greece and commonly worn by victors or deities. It should be positioned on the head and have a recognizable leafy structure, possibly simplified or stylized for artistic effect.
Question: Does the figure wear a stylized laurel wreath on her head?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction states that the dance pose must be retained. This means the posture—specifically the balance on pointe, arm position, and body alignment—should remain unchanged despite the transformation into a sculpture.
Question: Is the figure maintaining the same ballet pose (on pointe, arms extended) as in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The sculpture must exhibit a marble texture with subtle chisel marks. This refers to visible surface details such as fine lines, tooling imprints, and smooth yet slightly uneven finish typical of hand-carved stone, distinguishing it from polished or modern materials.
Question: Does the figure’s surface display a marble-like texture with visible chisel marks?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The background must be changed to an ancient Greek temple setting. This includes architectural elements like columns, pediments, and stonework consistent with Hellenistic design. The presence of Ionic columns is specifically required, identifiable by their scroll-shaped capitals.
Question: Are there Ionic columns present in the background of the scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The floor must be a mosaic, which implies a patterned surface made of small tiles arranged in geometric or decorative designs, typical of ancient Greek architecture. This contrasts with wooden flooring or plain surfaces.
Question: Is the floor beneath the figure composed of a mosaic pattern made of small colored tiles?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: Historical authenticity demands that the overall environment—including architecture, materials, and artifacts—reflect accurate representations of ancient Greek culture. This includes correct column styles, floor types, and absence of anachronistic elements.
Question: Does the scene include only historically accurate elements consistent with an ancient Greek temple setting, without modern or out-of-place objects?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
