- Create a miniature 3D Paris scene illustrating two Eiffel Towers in a dual-tier snow globe
- Upper tier features an intricate, antique Paris skyline with metallic hues
- Lower tier features lush, forested gardens in vibrant greens
- Silvery flakes drift between the tiers
- Base incorporates detailed sculpted cobblestones and classic street lamp motifs
- Scene is enclosed within a snow globe structure (implied by "dual-tier snow globe")
- Two Eiffel Towers are present and positioned appropriately within the scene
- The overall composition reflects a scaled-down, 3D model-like appearance suitable for a miniature scene

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating a "miniature 3D Paris scene" inside a "dual-tier snow globe." This implies that the entire scene should be contained within a transparent spherical or dome-like structure, with visible boundaries suggesting enclosure. The presence of two Eiffel Towers must be within this confined space.
Question: Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical or dome-shaped structure resembling a snow globe?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The upper tier must feature an "intricate, antique Paris skyline with metallic hues." This requires architectural details reminiscent of historical Parisian buildings, rendered in metallic tones such as bronze, gold, or silver, to convey antiquity and material quality.
Question: Does the upper tier display a detailed Paris skyline composed of buildings with metallic textures or finishes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The lower tier must have "lush, forested gardens in vibrant greens," indicating dense foliage, trees, shrubs, and greenery in vivid shades of green, contrasting with the upper tier's metallic theme.
Question: Does the lower tier contain dense, vibrant green vegetation including trees, hedges, and garden elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction mentions "silvery flakes drifting between the tiers," which refers to visual elements like falling snowflakes or glitter particles suspended in mid-air, particularly between the upper and lower levels.
Question: Are there visible silvery or white flake-like particles floating between the upper and lower tiers?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The base must include "detailed sculpted cobblestones and classic street lamp motifs," meaning the foundation of the snow globe should show textured stone pavement and decorative lampposts consistent with Parisian design.
Question: Does the base of the scene feature sculpted cobblestone patterns and classic street lamps?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies "two Eiffel Towers" in the scene. Therefore, both towers must be clearly present and distinguishable, not just one.
Question: Are there exactly two Eiffel Towers visible in the scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The scene is described as a "miniature 3D" representation, implying a sense of depth, scale reduction, and possibly a model-like aesthetic. The perspective and proportions should reflect a small-scale diorama rather than full-size realism.
Question: Does the scene exhibit characteristics of a miniature 3D model, such as exaggerated perspective, reduced scale, or model-like textures?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
