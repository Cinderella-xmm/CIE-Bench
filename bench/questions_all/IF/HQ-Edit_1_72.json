      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the image into a \"majestic ancient African mural,\" which implies a stylized, artistic rendering resembling traditional wall art.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The man’s attire must be emphasized as a regal Dashiki with gold embellishments.

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The background must depict a vast savanna with stylized Acacia trees. Stylization means the trees should not be photorealistic but instead simplified, exaggerated, or patterned in a way that aligns with mural aesthetics. Their shape should remain recognizable as Acacia.",

      "thinking_process": "The atmosphere must convey an old-world mystical ambiance with earthy hues. This involves a color palette dominated by browns, ochres, golds, and deep reds, avoiding modern or cool tones. Lighting should suggest dusk or dawn with soft, diffused glow.",
      "question": "Does the overall color palette consist primarily of earthy tones such as gold, brown, ochre, and deep red, creating a mystical atmosphere?",
