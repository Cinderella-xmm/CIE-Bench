Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the entire scene to be enclosed within a curved glass dome. This implies a transparent, rounded enclosure that contains all elements of the diorama, including the teapot and base. The presence of a dome is essential for transforming the image into a miniature diorama setup.
Question: Is the entire scene, including the elephant teapot and base, enclosed within a curved glass dome?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Steampunk styling involves mechanical elements such as gears, pipes, and copper-colored components. The instruction specifies adding gears and copper accents to the teapot. These must be visibly integrated into the design of the teapot, especially on its surface or structural parts like the spout, handle, or lid.
Question: Are there visible gears and copper-colored accents added to the surface of the elephant teapot?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The base beneath the teapot must simulate wooden floorboards, which should have a wood grain texture and planks aligned in a realistic manner. Additionally, scattered tea leaves and tiny silver utensils (such as spoons or tongs) must be present on this base to fulfill the detail requirement.
Question: Does the base feature simulated wooden floorboards with scattered tea leaves and tiny silver utensils?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Soft moss accents are specified to be embedded in the base of the dome. This means greenish, textured moss-like material should be visible at the bottom edge or corners of the base inside the dome, contributing to a naturalistic diorama effect.
Question: Are soft moss accents visibly embedded in the base area inside the glass dome?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The elephant’s trunk must emit steam effects to enhance the steampunk theme and suggest functionality. Steam should appear as wispy, translucent vapor rising from the tip of the trunk, indicating heat or operation.
Question: Is there visible steam emanating from the tip of the elephant’s trunk?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction requires surrounding the scene with intricate, vine-like metalwork. This implies decorative metal structures resembling vines or tendrils, possibly wrapping around the base or extending from the dome, enhancing the ornamental aspect of the diorama.
Question: Is the scene surrounded by intricate, vine-like metalwork that forms part of the dome or base structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
