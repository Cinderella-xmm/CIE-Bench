      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies emphasizing the bird's fluffy plumage in warm, earthy tones. This means the feathers should appear soft and voluminous, with colors such as brown, tan, ochre, or rust—colors that convey warmth and texture. Observers should notice enhanced fluffiness and appropriate color palette.",

      "thinking_process": "The oak leaves must be replaced with a stylized map showing a forest and tiny treasure icons.

      "thinking_process": "The original composition features the sparrow perched on a mossy branch. The instruction does not require changing the bird’s position or the branch, so these elements must remain intact. The branch should still be visible with moss, and the bird should be centered or naturally positioned on it.",
      "question": "Is the sparrow still perched on the same moss-covered branch as in the original image?",
