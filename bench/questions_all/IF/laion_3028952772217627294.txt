Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the cactus into a 3D plush doll mockup with visible detailed stitches. This requires assessing whether the cactus now appears three-dimensional and whether individual crochet stitches are clearly visible, particularly on the sombrero, which is a key feature.
Question: Are detailed crochet stitches visibly present on the cactus and its sombrero?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The donkey must be redesigned as a realistic plush prototype with a textured mane and vibrant striped pattern. This means evaluating whether the mane has a tactile, textured appearance and whether the stripes are vivid and properly rendered to resemble fabric or yarn.
Question: Does the donkey have a textured mane and a vibrant striped pattern on its body?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction requires placing both characters inside a colorful, playful packaging box labeled "Knitted Amigos." This involves checking if a new box structure surrounds the toys and if it includes the specified label.
Question: Are the cactus and donkey positioned inside a packaging box labeled "Knitted Amigos"?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Festive Mexican motifs should be incorporated into the packaging design. These include elements such as sombreros, maracas, papel picado, or traditional patterns. Their presence needs to be confirmed visually.
Question: Are festive Mexican motifs (such as sombreros, maracas, or traditional patterns) visible on the packaging box?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The branding must use child-friendly fonts, which typically feature rounded edges, bold strokes, and playful shapes. This requires examining the font style of the "Knitted Amigos" label.
Question: Is the text "Knitted Amigos" displayed in a child-friendly font with rounded, playful characteristics?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
