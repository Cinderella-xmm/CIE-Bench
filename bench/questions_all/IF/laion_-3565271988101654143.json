      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the smartphone display into a sci-fi mission control interface. This implies replacing the current financial data with futuristic UI elements such as glowing panels, digital readouts, and dynamic controls. The presence of non-financial, high-tech visual elements is essential.",
      "question": "Does the smartphone screen display a sci-fi mission control interface instead of financial charts and stock data?",
