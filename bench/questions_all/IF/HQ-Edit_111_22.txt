Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the woman to be depicted in a cartoon style. This implies simplified features, exaggerated proportions, smooth outlines, and possibly stylized facial expressions and clothing details typical of cartoon art. The current image is realistic, so the edit must transform it into a clearly cartoonish representation.
Question: Is the woman rendered in a cartoon style with simplified features and exaggerated proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The knitting needles must be elongated compared to their original size. This is a specific transformation that can be observed by comparing the length of the needles relative to the hands and the knitted fabric.
Question: Are the knitting needles visibly longer than in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The yarn should be transformed into vibrant patterns, meaning the texture and color of the yarn should no longer resemble natural wool but instead display bright, artistic, or abstract designs.
Question: Does the yarn being used in knitting feature vibrant, non-realistic patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Delicate lace patterns must be added to the robe. This means visible ornamental lace-like textures or embroidery should appear on the fabric of her robe, particularly along edges or sleeves.
Question: Are delicate lace patterns visible on the woman’s robe?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Warm sepia tones refer to a color palette dominated by golden browns, soft oranges, and muted yellows, giving the image an aged, vintage appearance. This affects skin tones, clothing, background, and lighting.
Question: Does the overall image have a warm sepia tone with golden-brown and orange hues?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A wooden texture border must frame the image. This means the outer edge of the image should include a border resembling wood grain, with visible texture and natural wood coloring.
Question: Is there a wooden texture border surrounding the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: A blank section for personal messages must be included. This implies a clearly defined, unobstructed area—likely at the bottom or side—intended for handwritten text.
Question: Is there a blank area in the image designated for personal messages?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
