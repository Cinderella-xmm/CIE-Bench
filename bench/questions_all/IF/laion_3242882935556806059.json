      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the orange lilies into crystal sculptures. This involves changing their material appearance from organic petals to crystalline structures, while preserving the overall shape. The key observable features are transparency, amber tint, and faceted surfaces resembling cut gemstones.",
      "question": "Are the lily flowers now composed of transparent, amber-tinted crystal-like material with visible jagged facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies maintaining the petal shapes through layered jagged crystal facets. This means the original flower form must be preserved but reinterpreted using geometric, angular crystal surfaces rather than soft biological textures.",
      "question": "Do the petals retain their original lily shape but appear constructed from layered, sharp-edged crystal facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The stems and leaves must be replaced entirely with glass rods. This implies removal of all green plant material and replacement with thin, translucent, rod-like structures that resemble glass or fused silica, originating from the vase.",
      "question": "Have the green stems and leaves been completely replaced with delicate, transparent glass rods extending from the vase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The bouquet must be positioned on a sleek black marble tabletop. This is a background/environment change that affects the base surface beneath the vase. Black marble should have a polished, reflective surface with natural veining patterns typical of stone.",
      "question": "Is the bouquet placed on a smooth, dark black surface with visible marble veining, indicating a black marble tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The overall goal includes enhancing elegance and craftsmanship. This is achieved through the use of high-quality materials (crystal, glass, marble) and precise transformations. The final image should convey a sense of refined artistry, which can be judged by the coherence of material transitions and visual harmony.",
      "question": "Does the entire composition—crystal flowers, glass stems, and black marble base—create a cohesive, elegant, and crafted aesthetic consistent with fine art objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
