Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies converting the chalets into crystalline ice castles. This implies replacing wooden architecture with transparent or translucent icy structures featuring geometric patterns, sharp angles, and frost-like textures. Frosted spires indicate vertical extensions resembling frozen crystal formations, and snowflake-patterned walls suggest repeating symmetrical designs typical of snowflakes.
Question: Are the chalets now made of crystalline ice with visible frosted spires and snowflake-patterned walls?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Pine trees are to be transformed into ice sculptures with icicle branches. This means the coniferous shape must remain recognizable but be reimagined using icy material—transparent or semi-transparent with hanging icicles forming branch-like structures. The texture should reflect cold, brittle, and reflective properties.
Question: Have the pine trees been transformed into towering ice sculptures with delicate icicle branches?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The snowy landscape must be replaced with a shimmering expanse of glowing ice. This requires the ground surface to no longer appear as ordinary snow but instead exhibit a luminous, reflective quality, possibly with subtle internal light effects or a soft glow beneath the surface, suggesting an ethereal frozen plane.
Question: Has the ground been replaced with a shimmering, glowing ice surface rather than regular snow?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Swirling auroras must be added above the scene. These are dynamic, colorful light displays in the sky, typically seen in polar regions, often in hues of green, purple, pink, and blue. They should appear as flowing ribbons of light arching across the night sky, enhancing the magical feel.
Question: Are swirling auroras visible in the sky above the scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The overall scene must become a fantastical, dreamlike winter realm. This involves not only individual transformations but also cohesion between elements—such as consistent lighting (e.g., ambient glow from ice), harmonious color palette (cool tones with accents of aurora colors), and a sense of magic through visual details like floating particles, soft glows, or surreal proportions.
Question: Does the entire scene convey a cohesive, fantastical, and dreamlike winter realm through the integration of crystalline structures, glowing ice, ice sculptures, and auroras?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
