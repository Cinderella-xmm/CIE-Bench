Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies a "semi-cartoon elder," which implies stylized features such as exaggerated facial expressions, soft edges, or simplified details while retaining human likeness. This requires evaluating whether the character's rendering deviates from photorealism toward cartoonish elements like smooth skin texture, rounded features, or simplified wrinkles.
Question: Does the elder have stylized, semi-cartoon features such as softened facial lines, exaggerated smile, or simplified proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The hanbok must feature enhanced floral motifs, meaning visible flowers that are more prominent, detailed, or numerous than typical designs. This includes added floral patterns on the fabric, especially along the collar, sleeves, or sash.
Question: Are there clearly visible and enhanced floral patterns on the hanbok, particularly along the collar and front panel?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for pastel colors, which include soft shades like light pink, peach, mint, lavender, etc. These should dominate the clothing, background, and decorative elements. A vibrant but gentle palette is expected.
Question: Are the dominant colors in the image pastel tones such as light pink, peach, mint, or lavender?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The hanbok’s gradient color must be adjusted for vibrancy, meaning the transition between colors should be smooth and visually striking, not flat or dull. This involves checking if the gradient enhances the visual appeal of the garment.
Question: Does the hanbok display a smooth and vivid gradient effect, transitioning between multiple pastel hues with noticeable vibrancy?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The background must be lush, implying dense foliage, blooming flowers (like cherry blossoms), and natural depth to support the postcard aesthetic. The presence of greenery and pink blossoms suggests a spring garden setting.
Question: Is the background composed of lush greenery and blooming pink flowers, creating a vibrant and natural environment?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The final product must be presented as a postcard within a floral-decorated envelope with green vine accents. This means the image should be framed or layered with an envelope design featuring floral patterns and vines, suggesting it's ready for mailing or display.
Question: Is the image displayed inside a floral-decorated envelope with visible green vine accents around its border?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No

Q7:
Thinking process: The image should be designed as a collectible postcard suitable for a stylish album. This implies a clean composition, balanced framing, and aesthetic appeal consistent with collectible art. It should resemble a printed card with margins and possibly a border.
Question: Is the image formatted like a postcard with proper borders and layout suitable for inclusion in a stylish collection album?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No
