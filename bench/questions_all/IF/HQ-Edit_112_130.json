      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly requires replacing the kimono with a lavish brocade gown featuring puffy sleeves. This involves changing both the garment type and its specific design features—brocade fabric implies intricate woven patterns and richness, while puffy sleeves are a distinct silhouette feature common in Victorian fashion.",
      "question": "Is the woman wearing a brocade gown with puffy sleeves?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The original cherry blossoms must be replaced with roses. This requires identifying floral elements in the scene and confirming they are now roses—specifically elegant ones, which implies full blooms, layered petals, and possibly deep red or pink hues typical of cultivated rose varieties.",
      "question": "Are the flowers in the scene now elegant roses instead of cherry blossoms?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The background must be reimagined as an ornate English garden. Key elements include wrought-iron gazebos (metallic, decorative lattice structures) and marble statues (classical figures or busts). These must be visible and properly integrated into the environment.",
      "question": "Does the background include wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The scene must convey opulence and tranquility. Opulence can be assessed through rich textures (e.g., brocade, polished stone), elaborate architecture, and luxurious materials. Tranquility is suggested by soft lighting, balanced composition, and absence of motion or chaos.",
      "question": "Does the scene exhibit signs of opulence (e.g., rich fabrics, ornate structures) and tranquility (e.g., calm lighting, harmonious composition)?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall style must reflect a Victorian-era painting. This includes characteristics such as realistic rendering, attention to detail, use of warm or muted tones, soft shadows, and classical composition. It should not resemble modern digital art or anime-style illustration.",
      "question": "Does the image have the visual style of a Victorian-era painting, including detailed brushwork, classical composition, and period-appropriate aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
