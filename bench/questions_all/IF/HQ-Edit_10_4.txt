Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire image into a sculpture made of dark wood. This implies that the subject must appear three-dimensional, with a matte or subtly reflective dark wooden texture covering all skin and clothing areas, mimicking aged carved wood. The material transformation is central to the edit.
Question: Is the entire figure rendered with a dark wood texture resembling an ancient African sculpture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The vibrant attire in the original image must be transformed into intricate carved patterns. This means the colorful fabric should no longer appear as cloth but as detailed relief carvings with depth, grooves, and geometric designs characteristic of traditional African art.
Question: Are the patterns on the clothing depicted as deeply incised carved reliefs rather than fabric?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The beaded crown and earrings must remain visually distinct but now appear as painted details on wood. This means they should retain their bright colors and bead-like structure but be integrated into the sculpture as if hand-painted onto carved surfaces.
Question: Are the beaded crown and earrings rendered in vivid, painted colors on the wooden surface, standing out from the surrounding carving?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The background must be reinterpreted as low-relief carvings depicting the original lush environment. This means the foliage and landscape should not appear as painted scenery but as shallowly carved textures on wood, maintaining recognizable shapes but with a sculptural quality.
Question: Is the background transformed into low-relief carvings that depict the jungle scene with visible texture and depth?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The overall style must reflect traditional African art, which includes deeply incised motifs, symmetry, and symbolic patterns. These elements must be evident in the carving style, including lines, shapes, and spatial arrangement.
Question: Are there deeply incised, symmetrical, and symbolic motifs present throughout the sculpture consistent with traditional African art?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The final appearance must have a polished, rich finish typical of well-crafted wooden sculptures. This refers to surface sheen, smoothness, and depth of color—indicating careful finishing rather than raw or unfinished wood.
Question: Does the sculpture exhibit a polished, rich finish with subtle highlights and depth, indicating a refined wooden surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The original figure's proportions, pose, and facial expression must be preserved despite the material and style transformation. This ensures the identity and dignity of the subject are maintained.
Question: Has the subject’s facial expression, posture, and overall proportion been preserved in the sculpture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
