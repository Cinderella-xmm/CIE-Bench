Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the robot to be designed as a premium collectible figure. This implies a polished, display-ready appearance with attention to detail, materials, and presentation quality. A premium collectible typically includes refined textures and finishes, such as brushed metal and matte surfaces, which are explicitly mentioned. The key observable feature is whether the robot exhibits these material properties.
Question: Does the robot exhibit a brushed metal and matte finish across its surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The packaging must be a sleek hexagonal box labeled "MECHA VANGUARD". This is a specific structural and textual requirement. The presence of a hexagonal shape and the exact label text must be confirmed. Since the original image shows only the robot, the edited version must include this packaging element.
Question: Is the robot displayed inside a hexagonal box labeled "MECHA VANGUARD"?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Replaceable weapons imply multiple weapon attachments that can be swapped. The instruction specifies including them, so at least two distinct weapons should be visible—either attached or stored nearby—and designed to be interchangeable.
Question: Are multiple weapons visible, indicating they are replaceable?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Detailed armor engravings refer to fine surface patterns or markings on the robot’s armor plating, suggesting craftsmanship and authenticity typical of premium collectibles. These should be visible upon close inspection.
Question: Are there visible detailed engravings on the robot's armor plates?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Articulated joints are essential for collectible figures to allow poseability. This means hinges or pivot points should be visible at the shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, etc., suggesting mobility.
Question: Are visible joint articulations present at key limb connections (e.g., shoulders, elbows, hips)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction requires a dramatic splash screen behind the robot showing a futuristic cityscape. This is a background element meant to enhance the high-tech theme. The cityscape should include features like skyscrapers, neon lights, flying vehicles, or advanced infrastructure.
Question: Is there a dramatic splash screen behind the robot depicting a futuristic cityscape?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The high-tech concept must be emphasized through the background. This means the cityscape should include technological elements such as glowing structures, hover vehicles, digital displays, or cybernetic architecture.
Question: Does the background cityscape include high-tech elements such as neon lights, flying vehicles, or digital interfaces?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
