      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the boot into an Art Deco-inspired sculpture. This implies a shift from realistic leather footwear to a stylized, artistic object with strong visual geometry and formal composition. Art Deco is defined by symmetry, bold lines, and often luxurious materials. The core transformation must be evident in the overall form and material appearance.",
      "question": "Is the boot transformed into a sculpture-like object with a rigid, stylized structure consistent with Art Deco aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The original boot features organic floral embroidery. The instruction specifies replacing these with geometric patterns. Art Deco style emphasizes angular, symmetrical, and repetitive geometric shapes such as zigzags, chevrons, sunbursts, or stepped forms. These should replace any naturalistic designs.",
      "question": "Are the embroidered floral patterns replaced with geometric designs such as zigzags, chevrons, or sunburst motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for streamlining the textures into \"stylized metal inlays with metallic sheen.\" This means the surface details must no longer resemble stitched leather but instead look like polished metal inserts—possibly chrome, brass, or brushed steel—embedded into the boot’s surface. Reflective highlights and smooth edges are key indicators.",
      "question": "Do the decorative elements on the boot have a metallic sheen and appear as inlaid metal plates or strips rather than stitched leather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The heel must be reshaped into a bold, stepped architectural motif. Art Deco architecture often features tiered, ziggurat-like structures. The heel should not be a simple block but a multi-level, angular form resembling a miniature skyscraper or temple base.",
      "question": "Has the heel been redesigned into a stepped, multi-tiered architectural shape with sharp angles and vertical emphasis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The original material is brown leather, which must be visually transformed to align with a metallic or sculptural finish. This includes changes in color tone (e.g., darker, reflective surfaces), texture (smooth, non-porous), and lighting response (highlights, reflections). The boot should no longer appear soft or flexible but rigid and permanent.",
      "question": "Does the boot surface exhibit a hard, reflective, non-leather-like finish consistent with metal or polished stone, indicating a sculptural material change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
