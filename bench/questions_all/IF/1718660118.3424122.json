      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the figure into a steampunk character while preserving the original pose. This means the figure’s posture—seated upright with hands resting on arms—must remain unchanged. The identity of the figure should be reimagined within a steampunk context, which implies visual cues like mechanical accessories or attire.",
      "question": "Is the figure seated in the same pose as in the original image, with hands resting on the armrests and body upright?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The military uniform must be replaced with a Victorian-inspired steampunk outfit. This involves replacing traditional buttons and fabric with brass elements, gears, and other mechanical details typical of steampunk fashion. The silhouette should resemble 19th-century formal wear but include industrial features.",
      "question": "Does the figure's outfit include visible brass components, gears, or mechanical embellishments integrated into a Victorian-style jacket or coat?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The chair must be replaced with a mechanical throne that includes cogwheel accents. This means the original ornate golden chair should no longer exist; instead, a throne made of metal parts, possibly with rotating or exposed gears, must be present.",
      "question": "Has the original chair been replaced with a throne that features visible cogwheels, rivets, or metallic mechanical structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The color scheme must shift to copper, brown, and dark green hues. These colors are characteristic of steampunk design and should dominate the clothing, throne, and environment. The original white and gold tones should be largely replaced.",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the outfit, throne, and background primarily copper, brown, and dark green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "A smoky backdrop with faint steam trails is required to create atmosphere. This means the background should not be clear or brightly lit but instead contain subtle wisps of smoke or vapor, especially around the throne or base of the figure.",
      "question": "Is there visible smoke or steam in the background, particularly near the base of the throne or behind the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
