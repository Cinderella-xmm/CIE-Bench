- Transform the mountain scene into a miniature encased within a glass terrarium
- Create snow-capped peaks using textured, glittering materials
- Form the lush landscape with intricate, fine-brushed foliage
- Add a reflective translucent resin layer as a lake at the base
- Position tiny, detailed chalet figurines along the shoreline
- Achieve a serene, immersive alpine environment through scale and material choice

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the entire mountain scene must be transformed into a miniature enclosed in a glass terrarium. This implies visible boundaries of a transparent container (e.g., glass walls), a scaled-down perspective, and an overall sense of containment. The presence of a glass enclosure is essential to satisfy this requirement.
Question: Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible glass terrarium structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The snow-capped peaks must be made from textured, glittering materials. This refers to a non-natural, artificial appearance—such as sparkly or iridescent textures—rather than realistic snow. Observability includes visible sparkle, texture variation, or shimmering surface effects on the mountain’s summit.
Question: Are the snow-capped peaks made of visibly textured and glittering materials?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The landscape should be formed with intricate, fine-brushed foliage, indicating highly detailed, handcrafted plant elements resembling brushwork rather than natural vegetation. This implies small-scale, stylized leaf patterns and deliberate artistic rendering.
Question: Does the landscape feature intricately detailed, fine-brushed foliage instead of natural-looking vegetation?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A reflective translucent resin layer must serve as the lake at the base. This means the water should appear smooth, glossy, and slightly translucent, with a synthetic sheen, not like natural water. It should reflect the scene above but have a distinct material quality suggesting resin.
Question: Is the lake represented by a reflective, translucent resin-like surface with a synthetic sheen?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Tiny, detailed chalet figurines must be positioned along the shoreline. These should be clearly recognizable as miniature buildings, proportionally smaller than real structures, with defined architectural features such as roofs, windows, and doors.
Question: Are there small, detailed chalet figurines placed along the shoreline of the lake?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
