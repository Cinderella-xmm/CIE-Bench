      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the original knitted animal into a mosaic sculpture. This implies replacing the knitted texture with a tile-based structure, changing the material and surface appearance entirely. The presence of visible individual tiles forming the shape is essential.",
      "question": "Is the animal composed of small, distinct ceramic tiles arranged to form its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The color scheme must use vibrant orange and deep black tiles specifically for the stripes. These colors should be consistent across the entire animal's body and clearly distinguishable as separate tiles.",
      "question": "Are the stripes made from glossy ceramic tiles in vibrant orange and deep black?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The facial features—especially the eyes and snout—must be preserved but recreated using precisely cut tiles. This means the eyes should still appear large and expressive, and the snout should retain its shape and positioning, all constructed from tiles.",
      "question": "Are the eyes and snout formed from precisely cut ceramic tiles that maintain their expressive appearance?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The sculpture must be placed on a sandy textured platform, which should visually differ from the smooth tiles. The platform should resemble natural sand with granular texture, providing a contrast in surface quality.",
      "question": "Is the mosaic animal positioned on a surface with a visible sandy texture?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes highlighting the tactile contrast between the smooth tiles and the rough backdrop. This means the visual difference in texture must be apparent—smooth, reflective tiles against a coarse, uneven sand surface.",
      "question": "Is there a clear visual contrast between the smooth, glossy surface of the tiles and the rough, granular texture of the platform?",

        "Yes",
