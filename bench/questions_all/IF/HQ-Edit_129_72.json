      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the cardinal into a mythical phoenix-like creature. This implies a fundamental change in form and identity, including the addition of flame effects at wingtips and tail, which are characteristic of phoenixes. The presence of flickering flames is a key visual feature that must be observable.",
      "question": "Are there visible flames gently flickering from the wingtips and tail of the bird?",

      "thinking_process": "The original red feathers must be replaced with iridescent scales. Iridescent scales imply a shimmering, multi-colored surface texture that reflects light in various hues, differing significantly from solid red feathers. This change must be evident across the bird’s body.",
      "question": "Has the bird's plumage been replaced with iridescent, shimmering scales instead of solid red feathers?",

      "question": "Do the bird's eyes appear as glowing embers with a warm, luminous glow?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for an \"enchanting contrast\" between the burning elements (flames, blossoms, bird) and the snowflakes. This means both elements—fire and snow—must coexist visibly, with the fire appearing bright and dynamic against the cold, white snowflakes falling around.",
      "question": "Are the burning elements (flames, glowing parts) clearly visible in contrast to the falling snowflakes in the scene?",
