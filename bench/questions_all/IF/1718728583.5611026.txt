- Reimagine the robot as an Art Deco sculpture with streamlined forms and chrome accents
- Render the flamingos as stylized geometric patterns
- Integrate the backdrop with angular palm trees and stylized rocks
- Use a muted pastel palette to evoke a vintage futuristic ambiance
- Maintain the overall composition of the robot among the flamingos
- Ensure all elements conform to the Art Deco aesthetic (symmetry, bold lines, geometric shapes, metallic finishes)

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the robot into an Art Deco sculpture. This involves identifying key visual traits of Art Deco style such as streamlined forms, symmetrical design, geometric motifs, and chrome or polished metallic surfaces. The robot must no longer appear as a realistic or cybernetic figure but instead have simplified, elegant, and stylized features consistent with early 20th-century modernist design.
Question: Does the robot feature streamlined, symmetrical forms with chrome or highly reflective metallic surfaces typical of Art Deco design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The flamingos must be rendered not as realistic birds but as abstract geometric patterns. This implies that their natural organic shapes should be replaced with angular, repeating, or faceted forms composed of polygons, lines, or tessellations. The goal is to visually transform them into decorative elements consistent with Art Deco aesthetics.
Question: Are the flamingos depicted as stylized geometric patterns rather than realistic birds?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The backdrop must include angular palm trees and stylized rocks. "Angular" suggests sharp edges and non-naturalistic geometry, while "stylized" indicates simplified or exaggerated forms. These elements must replace any naturalistic representations in the original image.
Question: Do the palm trees in the background have angular, geometric forms instead of natural, curved shapes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The rocks in the background must also be stylized—meaning they should lack natural erosion details and instead feature clean lines, flat planes, or stepped forms typical of Art Deco architecture and design.
Question: Are the rocks in the background rendered with stylized, geometric shapes rather than natural rock formations?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The color scheme must use a muted pastel palette to evoke a vintage futuristic ambiance. This means avoiding bright or saturated colors and instead using soft tones like pale pink, lavender, mint, or peach. The lighting should support this mood—soft, diffused, with no harsh contrasts.
Question: Is the entire scene rendered in a muted pastel color palette, avoiding strong or vibrant hues?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The overall composition must preserve the original arrangement of the robot standing among the flamingos, even if the elements are stylized. The robot should remain the central figure, and the flamingos should surround it in a similar spatial configuration.
Question: Is the robot positioned centrally among the flamingos, maintaining the original compositional layout?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
