      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the cat should be converted into a pop art poster, which involves using bold graphic lines to define its shape. This means the edges of the cat must be clearly outlined with thick, distinct lines, characteristic of pop art style.",
      "question": "Are bold, graphic lines used to delineate the outline and major features of the cat?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The sunglasses are explicitly instructed to be rendered in vibrant, flat orange. This implies no shading or textureâ€”only a solid, bright orange color applied uniformly across the lenses and frame.",
      "question": "Are the sunglasses depicted in a flat, vibrant orange color without gradients or shading?",

      "thinking_process": "The background is required to be simplified into abstract color blocks. This means the beach, ocean, and sky should not retain realistic details but instead be reduced to large, solid-colored areas with minimal detail, consistent with pop art abstraction.",
      "question": "Is the beach background composed of simplified, abstract color blocks rather than realistic scenery?",

      "thinking_process": "The harness and shadows are to be replaced with gradient fills. This means the original harness should no longer appear as a detailed leather strap but instead feature smooth transitions of color, and any shadow beneath the cat should be replaced with a gradient effect rather than a naturalistic shadow.",
      "question": "Are both the harness and the shadow under the cat replaced with gradient fills?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires the use of all primary colors (red, blue, yellow) for high contrast and visual impact. In pop art, this typically means dominant use of these colors in flat, unblended forms across the image.",
      "question": "Are red, blue, and yellow prominently used as flat, high-contrast colors throughout the image?",

        "Yes",
