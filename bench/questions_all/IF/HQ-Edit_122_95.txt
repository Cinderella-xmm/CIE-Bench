Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the entire image into a Byzantine mosaic on a golden backdrop. This implies that the visual texture should resemble small, colorful tiles (tesserae) arranged in patterns typical of Byzantine art, with a dominant gold background. The mosaic style must be visible across all elements, not just selectively applied.
Question: Is the entire image rendered in a mosaic style composed of small, colored tesserae?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The saree must be reimagined with peacock and vine patterns using vibrant tesserae. This requires the presence of recognizable peacock imagery (such as tail feathers or full birds) and intertwined vines, all constructed from mosaic tiles, not painted or digital textures.
Question: Are the sarees decorated with intricate peacock and vine patterns made from mosaic tesserae?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The Taj Mahal must be transformed into a domed basilica with arches leading to mythological scenes. This means the structure should no longer resemble the original Mughal architecture but instead feature large central domes, arched openings, and possibly narrative reliefs depicting mythological content.
Question: Has the Taj Mahal been replaced with a domed basilica featuring arches that lead into scenes depicting mythological figures or narratives?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The pose of the figures must change to a graceful ecclesiastical stance typical of solemn Byzantine figures. This includes upright posture, hands positioned in prayer-like or reverent gestures, and a serene facial expression consistent with religious iconography.
Question: Are the figures posed in a solemn, upright ecclesiastical stance with hands folded or held in a reverent manner, consistent with Byzantine religious icons?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Floral motifs must be integrated into the scene. These should appear as part of the mosaic design—either on garments, background, or architectural elements—and be clearly identifiable as flowers (petals, stems, etc.) made from tesserae.
Question: Are floral motifs visibly present throughout the image as part of the mosaic design, appearing on the sarees, background, or architecture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The background must be a golden backdrop consistent with Byzantine mosaics, where gold leaf or gold-colored tesserae dominate the surface behind the figures and architecture.
Question: Is the background composed primarily of golden mosaic tiles, creating a radiant golden backdrop?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
