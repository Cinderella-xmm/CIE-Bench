    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming all spherical and cubic objects into LEGO bricks. This implies replacing their original geometric forms with brick-like shapes (rectangular prisms with stud-like features), while preserving the marbled coloration from the original image. The transformation must be complete across all visible objects.",
      "question": "Are all spheres and cubes replaced with LEGO brick shapes that retain the original marbled patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The surface texture of the original objects is glossy and reflective. The instruction specifies changing this to LEGO's characteristic matte finish, which lacks reflections and has a non-glossy appearance. This change should apply uniformly to all transformed objects.",
      "question": "Do all LEGO bricks have a matte surface texture without reflective highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the arrangement should be structured and placed on a wooden shelf. A \"structured pattern\" implies orderly alignment or stacking, not random placement. The presence of a wooden shelf means there should be a visible wooden surface beneath the bricks, distinct from the original smooth gray floor.",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks arranged in an orderly, structured pattern on a wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "LEGO bricks are defined by their interlocking mechanism, which includes studs on top and corresponding indentations on the bottom. The instruction asks for \"subtle interlocking details,\" meaning these features should be visible but not exaggerated. Their presence enhances the authenticity of the LEGO form.",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks display subtle interlocking details such as studs or recessed connectors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The original background is soft and textured, possibly resembling stone or plaster. The instruction calls for simplification into a clean, minimalist aesthetic. This typically involves reducing visual complexity, using neutral colors, and removing distracting elements.",
      "question": "Is the background simplified into a clean, uniform, and uncluttered minimalist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
