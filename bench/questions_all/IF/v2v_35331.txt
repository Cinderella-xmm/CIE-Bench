Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires blending the dog and banana into a single form while maintaining realism. This involves checking if the two objects appear as one cohesive entity without visible seams or unnatural distortions.
Question: Does the dog and banana appear as a single unified form?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Realism in this context means the blended form should look natural and not obviously manipulated. This involves assessing the lighting, shadows, and textures to ensure they align seamlessly.
Question: Does the blended form retain a realistic appearance without obvious signs of manipulation?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: To evaluate if the blending is successful, the transition between the dog and banana should be smooth, with no abrupt changes in color, texture, or shape that would disrupt the illusion of a single entity.
Question: Is the transition between the dog and banana smooth and seamless?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The overall proportions and scale of the blended form should remain consistent with what would be expected from a realistic combination of these two objects. This ensures the final result does not appear disproportionate or unrealistic.
Question: Are the proportions and scale of the blended form consistent and realistic?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The lighting and shadows on the blended form should match the original lighting conditions of the scene, contributing to the overall realism.
Question: Do the lighting and shadows on the blended form match the original lighting conditions?
Choices: Yes, No
