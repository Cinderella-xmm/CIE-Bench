Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the central figure into a regal African queen. This implies changes in appearance, posture, and adornments that signify royalty, including elevated status, elaborate headwear, and dignified bearing. A regal queen would have distinct royal attributes such as crowns or headdresses, rich fabrics, and symbolic jewelry.
Question: Is the central figure depicted with royal regalia such as a crown-like headdress, elaborate jewelry, and dignified posture consistent with a queen?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies enhancing the attire with intricate golden embroidery and elaborate beadwork. This means the clothing must visibly feature gold thread patterns, detailed stitching, and extensive use of beads, especially on garments, sleeves, or sashes.
Question: Does the central figure’s attire include visible golden embroidery and elaborate beadwork on her dress, headpiece, or accessories?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the setting to be a grand marketplace with vibrant textiles around. This implies stalls, hanging fabrics, colorful cloths, and a bustling environment filled with trade goods and people. Textiles should be prominent and diverse in color and pattern.
Question: Are there vibrant textiles visible in the background, such as hanging fabrics, woven cloths, or colorful garments displayed at market stalls?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction states that villagers should pay homage to the central figure. This means other characters in the image must be positioned in ways that suggest respect—such as kneeling, bowing, or looking toward the queen with reverence.
Question: Are there individuals in the background depicted in postures or gestures indicating homage, such as bowing, kneeling, or respectfully facing the central figure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction asks for warm, earthen tones in the scene’s stylization. This refers to dominant colors like ochre, terracotta, brown, gold, and muted reds, with soft lighting and minimal cool tones. The overall ambiance should feel warm and grounded.
Question: Are the dominant colors in the scene warm and earthy (e.g., browns, oranges, yellows, terracotta), with soft lighting and no strong cool or blue hues?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction requires adding historical symbols to the market goods to reflect cultural richness and ancestral heritage. This means items like baskets, fruits, grains, or tools should bear carvings, patterns, or markings that represent cultural or ancestral significance (e.g., tribal motifs, hieroglyphic-style designs).
Question: Do the market goods (such as baskets, produce, or containers) display visible historical or cultural symbols, such as carved patterns, tribal designs, or ancestral motifs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The instruction implies maintaining the central figure’s position and role as the focal point while transforming her into a queen. Her placement should remain central and elevated in visual importance, not obscured or displaced by background elements.
Question: Is the central figure clearly positioned as the main subject, visually dominant and centered in the composition?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
