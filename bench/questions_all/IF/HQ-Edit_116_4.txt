Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the girl into a cartoon style. This implies simplified facial features, exaggerated proportions (such as large eyes or head), and smooth, stylized lines typical of cartoon art. The original image shows a realistic depiction, so verification must focus on whether these stylistic changes are present.
Question: Is the girl depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated features such as large eyes, simplified facial structure, and stylized proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The kimono must have exaggerated flowing patterns in brighter hues. This means the patterns should be more dynamic (e.g., wavy, elongated) and use intensified colors like neon or saturated reds, blues, yellows compared to the original subdued tones.
Question: Are the patterns on the girl's kimono exaggerated with flowing, dynamic designs and rendered in significantly brighter, more vivid colors than in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The lanterns in the original image are orange paper lanterns with Japanese characters. The instruction specifies replacing them with colorful balloons. This transformation involves changing shape (from cylindrical to spherical), material (paper to rubber-like), and color variety (to include multiple bright colors).
Question: Have all the hanging lanterns been replaced with colorful spherical balloons of various bright colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The card titles must be set in bold, traditional fonts. This implies the presence of text elements (likely at the top or side of the postcard) using a font that resembles classical East Asian calligraphy or traditional typefaces, with strong stroke weight and cultural authenticity.
Question: Are there visible card titles displayed in bold, traditional-style fonts (such as brush script or kanji-based typefaces) within the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Detachable sections for personal messages must be embedded at the bottom. This means there should be a clearly defined area—possibly perforated or outlined—that allows removal or writing, typically resembling a note section on a postcard.
Question: Is there a clearly marked detachable section at the bottom of the image intended for short personal messages, such as a perforated line or designated space labeled for writing?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The final output must be formatted as a collectible postcard. This includes a rectangular layout, clean edges, and visual design consistent with postcards (e.g., no excessive background clutter, balanced composition). The image should not appear as a full scene but rather as a curated card.
Question: Is the overall image composed in a rectangular postcard format with clean borders and balanced layout suitable for printing as a collectible card?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
