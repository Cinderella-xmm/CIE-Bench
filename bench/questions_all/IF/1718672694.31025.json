These branches should appear natural and integrated with the tree form.",

This includes maintaining the general silhouette and position of the original castle while replacing all materials and features with organic equivalents. The lighting and atmosphere should support a mystical, enchanted quality.",
      "question": "Does the entire structure now resemble a living, ancient tree sentinel with organic forms replacing all stone elements, and does the scene have a mystical, glowing ambiance?",
