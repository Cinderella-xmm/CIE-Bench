-Combine this stapler image with its rear view  
-Generate a side-by-side comparison showing the complete form
```

```
Q1:
Thinking process: To evaluate whether the front and rear views of the stapler are shown side by side, we must confirm that both perspectives are present and correctly placed relative to each other.  
Question: Does the edited image show the stapler from both the front and rear views side by side?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states that the comparison should be side-by-side. We need to confirm that these two views are indeed placed next to each other rather than in a stacked or overlapping manner.  
Question: Are the stapler's front and rear views arranged next to each other in a horizontal alignment?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q3:
Thinking process: Ensuring the complete form means that no important parts of either the front or the rear view are obscured or cut off. Each perspective should be fully visible.  
Question: Are all parts of the stapler visible in both the front and rear views without any truncation?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q4:
Thinking process: The stipulated combination requires that both views represent the same stapler, meaning they must match in terms of design, color, and other attributes.   
Question: Do the front and rear views of the stapler in the edited image match in terms of color and design details?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q5:
Thinking process: The comparison should focus solely on the stapler itself without introducing extraneous elements or altering background consistency between the two views.  
Question: Is the background consistent between the front and rear views of the stapler without additional elements introduced?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
