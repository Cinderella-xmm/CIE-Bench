Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the violin into a luxury branded instrument series. This implies that the original violin should no longer appear as a playable musical instrument but instead resemble a high-end product presentation, possibly in the form of a closed case or display object. The transformation must reflect exclusivity and craftsmanship.
Question: Has the violin been transformed into a closed, sleek case-like structure suitable for luxury branding?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The body of the violin must be converted into a case with a velvet lining. This means the internal surface visible when opened (or implied by design) should feature a soft, rich velvet material, consistent with premium packaging. The exterior should be smooth and polished, resembling a high-end case.
Question: Is the interior of the violinâ€™s body lined with a visible red or dark velvet material?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Gold accents are specifically required on the chinrest and tailpiece. These are distinct components of the violin, so their presence and material must be clearly identifiable. Gold coloring or metallic sheen should be present on both parts.
Question: Are the chinrest and tailpiece of the instrument adorned with gold-colored accents?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: An elegant, scripted font must be introduced along the strings. This implies text is placed directly on or near the strings, likely in a flowing, calligraphic style, suggesting brand name or series title. The text must be legible and stylistically refined.
Question: Is there a visible, elegant scripted font displayed along the strings of the instrument?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The original image shows a red upholstered ottoman. The instruction specifies replacing it with a sophisticated pedestal stand featuring ornate wooden details reminiscent of vintage furniture. This requires a structural change from a cushioned seat to a decorative, elevated display base with carved wood elements.
Question: Has the red upholstered ottoman been replaced with a wooden pedestal stand featuring ornate, vintage-style carvings?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
