Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly requires creating an infographic with a specific title. This means the final image must include text at the top or in a prominent location that reads "Parisian Park Etiquette" in a clear, readable font. The presence of this title is essential to fulfill the task's thematic goal.
Question: Is the title "Parisian Park Etiquette" visible and clearly displayed in the edited image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies using the pathway as a central guide and splitting the infographic vertically. This implies the layout should be divided into two distinct vertical sections, with the pathway serving as a visual axis. The structure must reflect symmetry or alignment along this path.
Question: Is the infographic layout split vertically, with the pathway acting as a central dividing line?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Section 1 requires illustrating sitting figures with stylized seating icons. This means that within the designated area labeled "Relax," there must be depictions of people seated, accompanied by simplified or symbolic representations of benches or chairs (e.g., geometric shapes or outlines).
Question: Are there stylized seating icons present alongside figures who are depicted as sitting in the "Relax" section?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Section 2 requires adding speech bubble graphics for park conversations and showing people walking with communication lines. This indicates that at least one group of individuals should be illustrated mid-walk, with speech bubbles connected by lines to indicate dialogue.
Question: Are there speech bubble graphics connected by lines to walking figures in the "Engage" section?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Section 3 requires highlighting photography with a camera icon that incorporates the Eiffel Tower. This means the camera symbol must visually integrate the tower—either as part of its lens, frame, or body—to reflect the theme of capturing Parisian scenery.
Question: Is there a camera icon in the "Capture" section that includes a depiction of the Eiffel Tower within its design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The design requirement emphasizes cool green tones and stylized silhouettes. This means the color palette should feature greens (e.g., teal, mint, forest green) rather than warm hues, and human figures should appear as simplified, non-detailed silhouettes or flat-style characters.
Question: Are the dominant colors in the infographic cool greens, and are the human figures represented as stylized silhouettes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: Clean typography is required to maintain elegance. This implies that any text used—especially the title and section headers—must use simple, legible fonts without decorative flourishes or excessive kerning/spacing.
Question: Is the text in the infographic presented in clean, elegant typography without cluttered or ornate styling?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
