      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies replacing all woodworking tools with enamel replicas. This requires verifying that each original tool (hammer, chisel, wrench, etc.) has been replaced by an enamel version, maintaining their form but changing material and finish. Enamel replicas imply high detail, smooth surfaces, and non-metallic sheen.",
      "question": "Are all the original woodworking tools replaced with intricately detailed enamel replicas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The hammer handle must be made of deep blue enamel, which implies a distinct color shift from the original wooden handle to a saturated blue hue with enamel-like smoothness and reflective properties.",
      "question": "Is the hammer handle rendered in deep blue enamel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The hammer heads are specified to have a glossy metallic finish, meaning they should reflect light and appear polished like metal, not rusted or dull as in the original image.",
      "question": "Do the hammer heads have a glossy metallic finish?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The wood shavings must be transformed into enamel curls in amber and ivory tones. This means the shavings should no longer look like organic wood fragments but rather crafted, curled, shiny enamel pieces in warm, variegated colors.",
      "question": "Have the wood shavings been replaced with delicate enamel curls in shades of amber and ivory?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The background must be changed from wood to a textured linen fabric surface. Linen texture implies visible weave patterns, soft folds, and matte or semi-matte finish, contrasting with the grainy, dark wood in the original.",
      "question": "Are the tools positioned on a textured linen fabric surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall aesthetic should complement the polished appearance of the enamel tools. This means the linen fabric should not be overly rough or distracting, but rather provide a neutral, refined backdrop that enhances the shine and detail of the enamel.",
      "question": "Does the linen fabric surface visually complement the polished appearance of the enamel tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
