      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies creating a \"miniature 3D scene\" inside a \"wooden shadow box\", which implies a framed, enclosed space with depth, visible edges of wood, and a sense of three-dimensionality. This requires observing whether the image is now presented as if viewed through a shallow wooden frame with depth cues such as shadows, perspective, or layering.",
      "question": "Is the figure displayed within a wooden shadow box that creates a 3D miniature scene effect?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction aims to convey \"refined cultural elegance and layered storytelling\". This can be evaluated by checking if multiple symbolic elements (hanbok, fan, cherry blossom, shadow box) are harmoniously arranged to suggest narrative depth and cultural richness. Layered storytelling implies visual depth and symbolic meaning beyond just clothing.",
      "question": "Are multiple culturally significant elements (hanbok, fan, cherry blossom, shadow box) arranged in a way that suggests layered narrative and cultural refinement?",
