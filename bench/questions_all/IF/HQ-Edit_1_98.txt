Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies "vintage postcard style with sepia tones," which implies a monochromatic or limited color palette dominated by brownish-yellow hues, soft contrast, and possibly grainy texture resembling aged paper. This requires evaluating whether the overall image has shifted from its original colors to a sepia tone and whether it exhibits characteristics of vintage postcards such as muted saturation and nostalgic lighting.
Question: Has the entire image been rendered in sepia tones consistent with a vintage postcard aesthetic?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The dress transformation requires replacing the current plain light green dress with one that features floral engravings. This means visible patterns of flowers should be integrated into the fabric design, possibly embossed or etched, maintaining the same silhouette and length but altering surface detail.
Question: Does the violinist's dress feature visible floral engravings across its surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The window view must be redesigned into an abstract, dreamy painted landscape of swirling forms. This means the natural outdoor scene (trees, sky) should be replaced with non-representational, flowing shapes and soft brushwork-like textures, suggesting a painterly abstraction rather than realism.
Question: Has the view through the window been replaced with an abstract painted landscape composed of swirling patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The violin must be embellished with gold inlays, meaning metallic gold-colored decorative elements—such as along the edges, f-holes, or scroll—should be visibly added to the instrument’s surface, enhancing its ornamental appearance without changing its basic shape.
Question: Are there visible gold inlays on the violin’s body, neck, or scroll?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A decorative handwritten music score must be added as a border around the image. This implies a frame-like element containing musical notation written in cursive or calligraphic style, positioned along the edge(s) of the image, contributing to the vintage aesthetic.
Question: Is there a decorative handwritten music score forming a border around the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
