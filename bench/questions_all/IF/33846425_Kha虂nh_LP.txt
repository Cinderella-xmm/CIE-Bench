Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the woman’s skirt must be enlarged. This refers to an increase in physical dimensions—specifically, the length and/or volume of the skirt—so it appears fuller and longer than in the original image. The change should be noticeable and proportional to the rest of her figure.
Question: Has the woman's skirt been visibly enlarged in size compared to the original?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: "Enhanced lace detailing" implies that the lace patterns on the dress—particularly on the skirt and bodice—should be more defined, intricate, or visually prominent. This could include sharper edges, increased opacity, or added texture to make the lace appear more elaborate.
Question: Are the lace details on the woman's dress more intricate and clearly visible than in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The original vehicle is a yellow off-road vehicle. The instruction requires transforming it into a vintage camper van, which implies changes such as adding windows along the sides, a raised roof, and possibly a different front design to resemble a classic camper style (e.g., 1960s–70s Volkswagen-style).
Question: Has the yellow car been transformed into a vintage camper van with features such as side windows, a raised roof, or other camper-specific modifications?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the vintage camper van must have floral paintings. These should be visible decorative elements—such as painted flowers or botanical motifs—on the surface of the van, likely on the sides or hood, to match the artistic postcard aesthetic.
Question: Are there visible floral paintings on the body of the vehicle?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The entire composition should be placed on textured kraft paper, which implies a brown, rough-textured background resembling recycled paper. This would serve as the base layer beneath the scene, altering the overall presentation to resemble a physical postcard.
Question: Is the entire scene placed on a background that resembles textured kraft paper?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Nautical-themed borders are required to highlight the seaside setting. These borders should include maritime elements such as anchors, waves, ropes, seashells, or compass designs around the edges of the image, framing the scene like a postcard.
Question: Does the image have decorative borders featuring nautical elements such as waves, anchors, or ropes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
