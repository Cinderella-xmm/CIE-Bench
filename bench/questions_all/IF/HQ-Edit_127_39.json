      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the Eiffel Tower into a cybernetic sorceress. This implies a fundamental change in identity from a static monument to a sentient, anthropomorphic figure with magical and technological traits. The presence of human-like features (such as eyes) and a distinct personality through visual cues is essential. The core structure should still resemble the Eiffel Tower but be interpreted as a living being.",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the Eiffel Tower as a sentient, humanoid-like cybernetic sorceress with a distinct form suggesting consciousness and magic?",

      "thinking_process": "The spire must be replaced with an energy crown. This means the original tip of the tower should no longer exist; instead, there should be a glowing, dynamic, possibly radiant or pulsating structure resembling a crown made of light or plasma, consistent with energy-based themes.",
      "question": "Has the original spire of the Eiffel Tower been replaced with a glowing energy crown at the top?",

      "thinking_process": "Digital glyphs are symbolic patterns that resemble code, runes, or circuitry, often used in sci-fi and cyberpunk aesthetics. These must be visibly integrated into the girders of the tower's structure, not just added as background decoration. They should appear embedded or etched into the metal framework.",
      "question": "Are intricate digital glyphs visibly engraved or illuminated on the structural girders of the tower?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies giving the sorceress \"eyes\" with a vibrant digital glow. This implies two glowing points (or areas) positioned where eyes would be on a face-like structure, likely near the upper section of the tower, emitting bright, colorful light typical of digital or cybernetic vision.",

It should maintain the lattice pattern but give the impression of draping or movement, like a robe made of metal.",
