      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires cartoonizing the child, which implies exaggeration of facial features (e.g., larger eyes, bigger head), proportions, and expressions. This is a stylistic transformation from realistic to cartoon-like, so we assess whether the child's features are visibly stylized beyond realism.",
      "question": "Is the child depicted with exaggerated cartoon-style features such as large eyes, oversized head, or stylized expression?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The coat and balloons must be rendered in pastel tones, meaning softer, lighter versions of colors (e.g., pale yellow instead of bright yellow, light blue instead of deep blue). This requires evaluating color saturation and brightness levels.",
      "question": "Are the coat and balloons rendered in pastel colors (soft, desaturated hues) rather than vibrant or saturated tones?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Watercolor textures imply visible brushstrokes, translucent washes, bleeding edges, and a painterly quality. The wheat field should no longer appear photorealistic but instead show texture resembling watercolor paper and pigment diffusion.",
      "question": "Does the wheat field exhibit visible watercolor textures such as soft edges, blended colors, or brushstroke patterns?",

      "thinking_process": "A hanging calendar grid must be present beneath the main scene. It should be structured like a monthly calendar with cells, likely positioned below the child and connected visually (e.g., hanging from the bottom of the image).",
      "question": "Is there a calendar grid displayed below the child, appearing as if it is hanging or attached to the scene?",

      "thinking_process": "Each balloon should represent a day on the calendar, implying that each balloon is linked to a specific date cellâ€”possibly through visual correspondence (e.g., one balloon per day, labeled or positioned above a cell).",
      "question": "Are the balloons visually associated with individual days in the calendar grid, such that each balloon corresponds to a single day?",

      "question": "Is the sky rendered in a soft, light blue hue consistent with a gentle, seasonal atmosphere?",
