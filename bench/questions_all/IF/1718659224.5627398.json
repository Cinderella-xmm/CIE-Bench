      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the entire scene into an edible cookie sculpture. This includes changing the material appearance of all structural elements (fortress, towers, walls) to resemble baked cookie dough. The key observable feature is whether the fortress now appears made of solid, textured cookie material rather than stone or rock.",
      "question": "Is the fortress constructed entirely from golden-brown cookie dough with darker edges resembling baked edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the fortress walls and towers must be made of golden-brown cookie dough with darker edges. This implies a consistent color palette and texture across all architectural components, particularly noticeable at the edges where baking would typically darken the dough.",
      "question": "Do the walls and towers of the fortress have a golden-brown base color with visibly darker edges, mimicking baked cookie dough?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly states that waterfalls should be created using finely piped royal icing. Royal icing is typically smooth, glossy, and white or translucent, often used in decorative piping. The waterfalls must therefore appear as flowing, smooth, and delicate lines rather than natural water.",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls depicted as finely piped, smooth, and glossy streams resembling royal icing rather than natural water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Trees are specified to be shaped from green-colored marzipan. Marzipan is a pliable, smooth-textured confectionery material, so the trees should appear soft, rounded, and uniformly green, not like natural foliage with detailed leaves.",
      "question": "Are the trees in the image made from smooth, uniformly green-colored marzipan with no realistic leaf detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires placing the entire cookie castle on a large white ceramic platter. This is a critical compositional element to highlight the edible nature of the scene. The platter must be visible beneath the structure and extend beyond it to provide contrast and context.",
      "question": "Is the cookie castle placed on a large, flat, white ceramic platter that is clearly visible beneath and around the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
