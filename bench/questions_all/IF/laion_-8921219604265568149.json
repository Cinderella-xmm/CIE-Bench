      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the entire scene into a miniature. This means the scale of all elements (cathedral, square, people) must be reduced to appear like a model or diorama. The key observable feature is whether the objects are proportionally smaller and appear to be part of a contained, scaled-down representation.",
      "question": "Is the cathedral and surrounding square depicted at a significantly reduced scale, consistent with a miniature model?",

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Miniature lamps with a dim, antique-style glow must be added. These should appear small in scale, have vintage designs (e.g., gas-lamp or lantern style), and emit soft, warm lighting that suggests antiquity.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The background behind the miniature must be a painted vignette of a vibrant sky. This means the backdrop should not be real sky but an artistic rendering showing dynamic colors (e.g., sunset hues, clouds) with a soft edge or fade typical of a vignette.",
      "question": "Is the background of the scene a painted depiction of a vibrant sky, with visible color gradients and cloud formations, framed by a soft vignette effect?",
