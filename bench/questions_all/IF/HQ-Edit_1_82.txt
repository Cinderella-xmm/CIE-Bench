Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating a "three-panel art print series," which implies the final output must consist of three distinct panels arranged together. This requires verifying whether the image has been divided into three separate but connected sections, each depicting a gymnast or related scene.
Question: Is the edited image composed of three distinct panels arranged side by side?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The style requirement is "semi-realistic cartoon form," meaning the figures should retain realistic proportions and anatomy but with stylized features such as exaggerated lines, simplified shading, or expressive poses typical of cartoon aesthetics. This needs to be checked against the original realism of Image A.
Question: Are the gymnasts depicted in a semi-realistic cartoon style, with stylized features but retaining human proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: "Flowy outfits echoing movement" refers to garments that appear to ripple or drape dynamically, suggesting motion. This involves checking if the leotards or attire have soft, flowing lines rather than tight, rigid forms, and if they visually suggest motion.
Question: Do the gymnasts' outfits feature flowy designs that suggest movement, such as draping or trailing fabric?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: "Earthy tones" refers to colors like brown, olive green, terracotta, ochre, and muted golds—natural, warm hues derived from soil and nature. These must dominate the color scheme, especially in clothing, background, and lighting.
Question: Are the dominant colors in the image earthy tones such as browns, greens, and warm neutrals?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: "Highlight sequined patterns" means visible reflective or glittering details on the outfits, likely in strategic areas (e.g., chest, back, sleeves) to catch light and add texture. These should be clearly distinguishable as decorative elements.
Question: Are there visible sequined or sparkly patterns on the gymnasts’ outfits that stand out due to texture or reflection?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for presentation "within a dark walnut tri-fold frame," indicating the image must be framed in a specific material (dark walnut wood) and format (tri-fold, meaning three hinged panels). This is a physical display requirement, so the frame must be visibly present.
Question: Is the artwork presented inside a dark walnut-colored tri-fold frame suitable for tabletop display?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
