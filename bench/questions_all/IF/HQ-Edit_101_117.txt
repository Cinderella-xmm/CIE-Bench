Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the mannequin into a stone sculpture. This means the material must change from metallic or synthetic to stone, with visible textural differences such as roughness, grain, and natural imperfections typical of carved stone.
Question: Is the mannequin now rendered as a stone sculpture rather than a metallic or plastic figure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The original saree features rich embroidery; the instruction specifies that these patterns should be translated into carved floral and paisley motifs on the stone surface. These motifs must be visibly engraved and detailed, matching the complexity of the original fabric design.
Question: Are delicate floral and paisley motifs carved into the stone surface of the saree and body, reflecting the original embroidery?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The pose must be stylized and serene, resembling classical Indian sculptures (such as those from the Gupta or Chola periods). This includes a balanced posture, possibly with one hand in a mudra or resting gracefully, and a calm facial expression if present.
Question: Is the mannequin depicted in a stylized, serene pose characteristic of classical Indian stone sculptures?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The jewelry (necklace and bangles) must not be removed but transformed into ornate carved details on the stone, meaning they should appear as part of the sculpture’s surface, not as separate metallic objects.
Question: Have the regal jewelry elements been converted into intricately carved stone details instead of remaining as separate accessories?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The stone must exhibit a weathered, historical texture—indicative of age—with possible cracks, patina, or surface wear to suggest antiquity. This contrasts with a polished or new appearance.
Question: Does the stone surface show a weathered, aged texture consistent with an ancient sculpture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The overall shape and drape of the saree must be preserved, even though it is now made of stone. The flow and fold lines should still resemble traditional saree draping, but rendered in carved stone.
Question: Is the saree’s draping and silhouette accurately maintained in stone form, with folds and pleats clearly defined through carving?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
