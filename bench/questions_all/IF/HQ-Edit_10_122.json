      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the portrait should be reimagined as a vibrant African mural on a village wall. This implies a shift from a realistic portrait to a stylized, two-dimensional artwork resembling a wall painting. Key features include flat perspective, strong outlines, and a lack of deep 3D shading typical of murals. The surface texture should suggest it's painted on a wall, possibly with visible brushwork or texture.",
      "question": "Is the portrait rendered in a flat, stylized manner consistent with a mural painted on a wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The attire must be transformed into traditional patterned textiles with vivid colors. Traditional African textiles often feature geometric patterns, bright color contrasts (such as red, yellow, blue, green), and specific motifs like Adinkra symbols or Kente patterns. The clothing should clearly reflect these elements.",
      "question": "Does the subject’s attire feature traditional African textile patterns with vivid, contrasting colors such as red, yellow, blue, and orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The jewelry must include intricate tribal motifs to enhance cultural depth. Tribal motifs typically involve symbolic designs such as spirals, animal shapes, geometric carvings, or culturally significant symbols. The gold hoops and necklaces should not just be plain but contain detailed engravings or patterns.",
      "question": "Do the earrings and necklaces feature detailed tribal or symbolic patterns rather than plain metallic surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The background market scene must be stylized into a lively, painterly depiction with bustling figures. This means the background should show simplified human figures engaged in activity, not just static stalls. The style should resemble a painting—possibly with expressive brushstrokes, exaggerated proportions, or flattened depth—rather than photorealism.",
      "question": "Are there simplified, animated human figures visible in the background market scene suggesting movement and interaction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Abstracted umbrellas are required in the background. These should not be realistic but instead stylized, possibly with exaggerated shapes, bright colors, and non-naturalistic proportions. They should contribute to the festive, artistic atmosphere.",
      "question": "Are the umbrellas in the background stylized with exaggerated shapes and bright colors, differing from realistic depictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Rhythmic musical notes must be incorporated to evoke community spirit. These should be visible floating around the subject, possibly in motion, and colored vibrantly to match the overall palette. Their presence should feel dynamic and integral to the scene.",
      "question": "Are colorful musical notes visibly floating around the subject, contributing to a sense of rhythm and celebration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "A bold interplay of colors is required throughout the image. This means high contrast, saturation, and a rich variety of hues across the entire composition—clothing, background, jewelry, and sky. The color scheme should feel energetic and cohesive.",
      "question": "Is there a strong, saturated use of multiple vivid colors (e.g., red, yellow, blue, green) across the entire image, creating a bold and dynamic visual effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
