Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the aircraft into a stylized 3D model. This implies a shift from a photorealistic depiction to a more artistic, geometric, or simplified 3D rendering style, possibly with visible edges, shading, or surface textures consistent with digital modeling.
Question: Is the aircraft rendered in a stylized 3D model form rather than a photorealistic representation?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The aircraft must be enclosed within a vintage aviator's glass display case. This means the plane should no longer be flying freely in the sky but instead be contained within a transparent enclosure that resembles a museum or collector's case.
Question: Is the aircraft fully encased within a glass display case?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The display case must feature worn leather accents, which implies visible leather trim or padding along the edges or frame of the case, showing signs of aging such as scuffs or discoloration.
Question: Are there visible worn leather accents on the display case?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Brass corners are specified as part of the case design. These would appear as metallic corner brackets or reinforcements at the edges of the glass case, typically with a golden or aged yellow tone.
Question: Does the display case have brass-colored corner fittings?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: An engraved emblem must be present on the front of the case. This implies a visible, detailed insignia or symbol etched into the surface, likely related to aviation or military heritage.
Question: Is there an engraved emblem visible on the front face of the display case?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Miniature clouds must be included inside the case to create a sense of depth and atmosphere. These should be small-scale cloud models positioned within the glass enclosure, not part of the background sky.
Question: Are there small, artificial clouds placed inside the glass display case?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The plane must be positioned diagonally upward to convey motion and dynamism. This refers to the orientation of the aircraft within the caseâ€”tilted upward from lower left to upper right or vice versa.
Question: Is the aircraft oriented diagonally upward within the display case?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: Tiny spinning propellers must be integrated to suggest flight. This means the propellers should appear animated or blurred in motion, even if static in the image, to imply rotation.
Question: Do the propellers of the aircraft show visual effects indicating they are spinning (e.g., motion blur or rotational distortion)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
