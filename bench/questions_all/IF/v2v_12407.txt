Question: Is the mango depicted with visible pixelation characteristic of 8-bit graphics?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: In 8-bit pixel art, objects typically have a simplified appearance due to the limited resolution. This includes the table and napkin.
Question: Are the table and napkin rendered with a simplified, low-resolution appearance consistent with 8-bit graphics?
Choices: Yes, No

Q4:
Thinking process: Shadows and highlights in 8-bit art are usually represented with fewer shades and gradients, resulting in a flatter look.
Question: Are shadows and highlights on the mango and table simplified to match the flat shading typical of 8-bit graphics?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The overall composition in 8-bit art tends to be straightforward without intricate details, focusing on basic shapes and forms.
