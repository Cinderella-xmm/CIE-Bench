      "thinking_process": "Keeping the surfers' poses intact means their body positions relative to the new surface (manta ray) should remain the same as they were on the surfboard. Checking if the surfer appears to be balancing on the manta ray in a similar manner verifies this requirement.",
      "question": "Are the surfers' original poses maintained on the manta ray?",

      "thinking_process": "Adding a dreamy atmosphere involves introducing elements that give the scene an ethereal quality, such as soft lighting, pastel colors, or a misty effect in the environment. The goal is to observe these features to evaluate the dreamy effect.",

      "thinking_process": "The manta ray replacing the surfboard should realistically appear as a large marine creature beneath the surfer. Confirming the scale and appearance of the manta ray ensures that the replacement adheres to the instructions.",
      "question": "Is the manta ray depicted as a giant creature beneath the surfer?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The dreamy atmosphere should not interfere with the clarity of other elements in the image. Checking if the surfer and the manta ray remain distinct and recognizable ensures that the dreamy effect does not compromise overall legibility.",
      "question": "Are the surfer and the manta ray still clearly visible and identifiable despite the dreamy atmosphere?",
