- Render her in a semi-realistic art style emphasizing her vibrant traditional attire with intricate beadwork and patterned fabrics
- Include stat bars: [Wisdom +9], [Cultural Insight +10], [Grace +8], [Unity +9]
- Place a woven-texture title banner at the top
- Place a gold-etched nameplate below the image
- Frame the card with geometric tribal motifs
- Use a warm, nature-inspired background of abstracted trees and gathering figures

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the image into an RPG-style digital character card. This means the entire composition must be framed as a collectible card with defined borders, text elements, and visual hierarchy typical of such cards. The presence of a border, stats, and structured layout are key indicators.
Question: Is the image formatted as a digital collectible card with a clear border and structured layout?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The woman must be rendered in a semi-realistic art style that emphasizes her traditional attire, particularly the beadwork and patterns. Semi-realistic implies a balance between photorealism and stylization—details like fabric texture and embroidery should be visible but slightly enhanced or stylized.
Question: Does the woman’s attire retain its vibrant colors and intricate beadwork, rendered in a semi-realistic art style?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The stat bars must be clearly visible and labeled exactly as specified: [Wisdom +9], [Cultural Insight +10], [Grace +8], [Unity +9]. These are specific text elements that must appear in the card design.
Question: Are the stat bars [Wisdom +9], [Cultural Insight +10], [Grace +8], and [Unity +9] present and correctly labeled?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A woven-texture title banner at the top is required. This implies a horizontal band across the top of the card with a texture resembling woven fabric, likely containing the title "Guardian of Heritage."
Question: Is there a woven-texture banner at the top of the card displaying the title "Guardian of Heritage"?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A gold-etched nameplate must be placed below the image. This refers to a decorative label beneath the character's portrait, with a metallic gold appearance and etched lettering, possibly with the name "Guardian of Heritage" or similar.
Question: Is there a gold-etched nameplate located directly below the character's image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The card must be framed with geometric tribal motifs. These are decorative borders composed of angular, repeating patterns inspired by traditional African designs, consistent with the cultural context of the attire.
Question: Does the card have a border made of geometric tribal motifs surrounding the central image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The background must be warm and nature-inspired, featuring abstracted trees and gathering figures. Warm tones (e.g., orange, yellow, earthy greens) and soft, blurred silhouettes of people and trees should be present to suggest a communal, natural setting.
Question: Is the background warm-toned and composed of abstracted trees and faint silhouettes of gathering figures?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
