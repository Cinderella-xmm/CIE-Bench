    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the hat into an Art Deco style. This requires identifying key visual traits of Art Deco—such as symmetry, geometric shapes, stepped forms, and luxurious materials. A \"vibrant\" Art Deco style implies high contrast and rich coloration.",
      "question": "Does the hat feature distinct geometric patterns such as zigzags, chevrons, or stepped lines typical of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly calls for gold accents along the streamlined brim. Gold is a signature material in Art Deco aesthetics, often used to highlight edges or borders.",
      "question": "Are there visible gold-colored accents along the edge or brim of the hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The fabric must be styled with bold turquoise, cream, and silver motifs. These colors should be clearly present and not just subtle hints. The combination should reflect the opulence and contrast characteristic of Art Deco.",
      "question": "Does the hat display prominent sections of turquoise, cream, and silver in its fabric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The requirement includes intricate, symmetrical design elements. Symmetry is a core principle in Art Deco, so the patterns must mirror each other across the hat’s surface.",
      "question": "Are the decorative patterns on the hat symmetrically arranged across the crown and brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The design must harmonize with the waves of the hair. This means that the flow or direction of the hair should align visually with the movement or rhythm of the hat’s design elements (e.g., curved lines matching hair curls).",
      "question": "Do the geometric or linear patterns on the hat follow or complement the natural wave and direction of the model’s hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The original hat shape and placement on the head must be preserved while applying the new design. The transformation should not alter the hat’s fundamental structure or position.",
      "question": "Is the hat still positioned on the head in the same way as in the original image, with no change in angle or fit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The model’s facial features and expression should remain unchanged, as the edit focuses only on the hat. Any distortion or alteration to her face would violate the intent of the task.",
      "question": "Have the model’s facial features, expression, and skin tone remained unaltered from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
