Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the teapot into a candle holder. This implies that the object's function and form must be redefined from a teapot to a candle holder, which involves structural changes such as removing the spout and handle if they are not part of the new design, and introducing features like a wick or candle receptacle. The core visual identity should now reflect a candle holder rather than a teapot.
Question: Has the teapot been transformed into a candle holder with a visible candle or wick structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The body of the teapot must be replaced with a glass container featuring intricate embossed patterns. This means the material must appear transparent or translucent (glass), and the surface must display detailed raised designs resembling embossing. The original metallic body should no longer be present.
Question: Is the body of the object now made of glass with visible intricate embossed patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The lid must be modified into a finial-style candle snuffer. This implies the top part should resemble a decorative finial (a stylized cap or ornament) and include a functional element like a metal snuffer tip used to extinguish candles. It should no longer resemble a traditional teapot lid.
Question: Has the lid been redesigned into a decorative finial-style candle snuffer with a snuffing mechanism?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The original lace tablecloth must be replaced with a sleek marble base that has a reflective surface. This means the fabric must be removed entirely and replaced with a solid, polished stone-like material that reflects light, possibly showing subtle veining typical of marble.
Question: Has the tablecloth been replaced with a sleek, reflective marble base?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A small nameplate reading "Elegance Aroma" must be added to the side of the container. This requires the presence of a clearly legible text label positioned on the side of the glass container, in a font and size appropriate for a luxury product nameplate.
Question: Is there a small nameplate on the side of the container with the text "Elegance Aroma"?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
