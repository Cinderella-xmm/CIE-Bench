Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the original image of the toy car and robot into a collectible packaging. This implies replacing the current scene with a product box that contains and displays the toys. The presence of a box structure is essential to satisfy this requirement.
Question: Is there a collectible packaging box visible in the edited image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The box must be designed in an isometric perspective, which means it should show three sides of the box (top, front, and side) at an angle, giving a 3D effect without full perspective distortion. This is a specific visual requirement tied to presentation style.
Question: Is the packaging box rendered in an isometric perspective?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The label "DUAL TRANSFORMER HEROES" must appear on the packaging. This is a textual element that must be clearly legible and positioned appropriately on the box.
Question: Is the text "DUAL TRANSFORMER HEROES" visible on the packaging box?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies including chibi-style versions of both the car and robot inside the box. Chibi style refers to stylized, cartoonish characters with large heads and small bodies. These should be visibly distinct from the real-scale figures.
Question: Are chibi-style versions of the car and robot present inside the packaging box?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The chibi figures must be colored in vibrant metallic red and black. Metallic finish implies reflective surfaces or shimmering textures, not flat colors. This affects material appearance.
Question: Are the chibi figures inside the box rendered in vibrant metallic red and black colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly lists accessories: a mini tool set, interchangeable helmets, and a gear base. All three must be included inside the box as part of the collectible set.
Question: Are the mini tool set, interchangeable helmets, and gear base visible inside the packaging box?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The figures must be displayed outside the box, meaning they should appear in front of or adjacent to the packaging, separate from the interior display. They should not be hidden inside.
Question: Are the full-sized car and robot figures displayed outside the packaging box?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: The figures outside the box must have realistic textures for a lifelike appearance. This includes detailed surface rendering such as reflections, depth, and material accuracy (e.g., glossy paint, metal parts).
Question: Do the figures outside the box exhibit realistic textures and lifelike appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q9:
Thinking process: The figures must be presented in a polished showcase, implying a clean, reflective, or glass-like environment that highlights the items. This includes lighting, reflections, and professional display setup.
Question: Are the figures placed in a polished showcase environment with reflective surfaces or professional lighting?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
