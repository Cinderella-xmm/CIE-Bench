This requires evaluating whether the entire structure is composed of LEGO-like interlocking bricks, with dominant use of brown and gold colors, replacing the original wood and metal materials.",

This requires assessing whether the curves are built from angled or sloped LEGO elements instead of smooth continuous surfaces.",
