Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating a "miniature chibi-style parrot diorama within a glass dome." This implies that the entire scene must be contained inside a transparent spherical or domed structure. The presence of a visible glass boundary or reflection effect is essential to confirm the dome.
Question: Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent glass dome?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The parrot must be rendered in a chibi style, which typically involves exaggeratedly large head, small body, and simplified features. This is distinct from the realistic style seen in Image A. The transformation to chibi must be evident in proportions and facial features.
Question: Is the parrot depicted in a chibi style with a large head and simplified body proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the parrot to sit on a branch surrounded by oversized, vibrant leaves. These leaves should be larger than natural scale relative to the parrot, emphasizing the miniature diorama aesthetic.
Question: Are the leaves surrounding the parrot significantly larger than normal scale and vibrant in color?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly calls for tiny, dew-like crystal beads on the leaves. These must be visible as small, reflective droplets resembling crystals, not just regular water droplets.
Question: Are there small, shiny, crystal-like beads visible on the surface of the leaves?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A minuscule explorer must be present, positioned on a separate branch, actively sketching the parrot. This figure should be much smaller than the parrot and clearly engaged in drawing.
Question: Is there a tiny human figure on a different branch, holding a sketchbook or drawing tool and facing the parrot?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The base of the dome must have a wood texture with etched tribal patterns. This detail adds thematic depth and must be visible at the bottom of the dome structure.
Question: Does the base of the glass dome feature a wooden texture with carved or etched tribal patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The overall scene must enhance the rainforest theme. This includes appropriate flora, lighting, and atmosphere consistent with a tropical jungle environment, even within the miniature setting.
Question: Does the diorama include visual elements such as dense foliage, mist, or warm ambient lighting that suggest a rainforest environment?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
