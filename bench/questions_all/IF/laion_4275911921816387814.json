      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the original metallic dagger into a plush toy. This implies that the object should no longer appear rigid or metallic but instead have a soft, stuffed appearance typical of toys. The material properties must change from hard metal and bone to soft textiles.",
      "question": "Is the dagger now rendered as a soft, plush toy rather than a rigid weapon?",

      "thinking_process": "The blade must be replaced with silver-gray fabric featuring black embroidery. This means the surface texture should resemble fabric, not polished metal, and the pattern should be stitched or embroidered in black on a silver-gray base.",
      "question": "Is the blade made of soft, silver-gray fabric with black embroidered patterns?",

      "thinking_process": "Rounded and smooth edges are required to ensure the plush toy is safe and visually soft, avoiding sharp angles typical of real weapons. This applies to both the hilt and the transition between hilt and blade.",
      "question": "Do all edges of the plush dagger, including the hilt and blade, appear rounded and smooth?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The plush toy must be stuffed to maintain volume and soften its features, meaning it should appear puffy and three-dimensional, not flat or rigid.",
      "question": "Does the plush dagger appear stuffed and voluminous, with softened contours?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The background must be a solid color to provide gentle contrast without distracting from the plush toy. This means no complex patterns, gradients, or textures should be present in the background.",
      "question": "Is the plush dagger placed against a solid-colored backdrop?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
