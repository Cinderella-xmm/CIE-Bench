      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction \"reimagine the statue as a ukiyo-e artwork\" implies transforming the visual style to match traditional Japanese woodblock prints. This includes flat colors, strong outlines, absence of realistic shading, and stylized composition. Observable features include use of bold lines, limited depth, and decorative elements typical of ukiyo-e.",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit characteristics of ukiyo-e art such as flat color areas, strong outlines, and stylized forms instead of realistic 3D rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies flattening the robes into flowing patterned cloth using indigo and gold. This means the drapery should no longer appear volumetric or sculptural but rather as a two-dimensional design with patterns, and the color palette must include indigo and gold tones.",
      "question": "Are the robes flattened into a two-dimensional, flowing pattern with visible indigo and gold coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires emphasizing the arms with calligraphic lines. In ukiyo-e, calligraphic lines are often used to suggest motion or energy, resembling brushstrokes. This means the arms should be outlined or accented with dynamic, expressive lines that resemble ink calligraphy.",
      "question": "Are the arms accentuated with dynamic, brushstroke-like calligraphic lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction asks to render the figure's face in soft, serene outlines. This implies a departure from detailed facial modeling toward simplified, gentle contours without sharp features or deep shadows, consistent with the delicate line work seen in ukiyo-e portraits.",
      "question": "Is the face depicted with soft, minimalistic, and serene outlines rather than detailed anatomical features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for replacing the sky with stylized, wave-like clouds to create an ethereal atmosphere. This means the background must no longer be a clear blue sky but instead feature repeating, flowing cloud motifs reminiscent of Japanese wave patterns (e.g., like Hokusaiâ€™s waves), rendered in a decorative, non-realistic way.",
      "question": "Has the sky been replaced with stylized, wave-like cloud patterns that evoke an ethereal, decorative atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
