- Feature: Guitar body transformed into an armored torso
- Texture: Wood grain emphasized as a metallic, deep mahogany finish
- Style: Dynamic illustrative lines added to convey motion and energy
- Detail: Strings reimagined as muscle strands wrapping around the body
- Addition: Luminous cape flowing from the neck with sound wave motifs

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the guitar body should become an armored torso. This implies a transformation where the body retains its general shape but is stylized to resemble armor, possibly with angular edges, plating, or protective elements. The presence of armor-like features such as plates, rivets, or segmented sections should be visible.
Question: Has the guitar body been transformed into an armored torso with clear armor-like features?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The texture requirement specifies a metallic, deep mahogany finish. This means the wood grain should not appear natural wood but instead have a reflective, metallic sheen while retaining the color and pattern of deep mahogany. The surface should look polished and slightly reflective, like metal with a warm brown tone.
Question: Does the guitar body exhibit a metallic, deep mahogany finish with visible reflective qualities?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The style instruction calls for dynamic illustrative lines, which are typically used in comic book art to suggest movement, speed, or power. These lines are often curved or radiating and placed around or behind the character to imply action or energy.
Question: Are dynamic illustrative lines present around the character to suggest motion or energy?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The strings are to be reimagined as muscle strands wrapping the body. This means the six strings should no longer appear as thin metal wires but instead as thick, cord-like structures resembling muscles, possibly with striations or tension lines, wrapped around the torso area.
Question: Have the guitar strings been transformed into thick, muscle-like strands wrapping around the body?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A luminous cape must flow from the neck, suggesting it extends backward and upward with light effects. It should include sound wave motifs—wavy, rhythmic patterns resembling audio waves—and a bright emblem on the headstock, likely glowing or distinct in design.
Question: Is there a luminous cape flowing from the neck with sound wave motifs and a bright emblem on the headstock?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The original guitar structure must remain recognizable despite transformation. Key parts like the headstock, neck, and body outline should still be identifiable even if stylized. The overall silhouette should still resemble a guitar-shaped figure.
Question: Is the overall shape of the guitar still recognizable, including the headstock, neck, and body?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
