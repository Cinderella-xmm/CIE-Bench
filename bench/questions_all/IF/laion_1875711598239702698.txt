Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the elephants into fragrance bottles. This implies that the original animal form must be restructured into a functional bottle shape, including a neck and cap structure. The key observable feature is whether the body has been reshaped into a bottle silhouette with a distinct opening or neck area.
Question: Has the body of each elephant been transformed into an elegant, curved bottle shape with a defined neck?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the gold-trimmed caps should resemble the elephant’s ears. This means the ears must be redesigned to function as decorative bottle caps, likely positioned at the top of the bottle, with gold trim visible around their edges.
Question: Are the elephant's ears now shaped like gold-trimmed caps positioned at the top of the bottle structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The original glittering texture on the back of the elephants must be converted into a glass mosaic pattern. This involves replacing the existing textured surface with a pattern that resembles small reflective tiles or glass pieces arranged in a decorative layout.
Question: Has the glittering texture on the backs of the elephants been replaced with a glass mosaic pattern composed of small reflective tiles?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A sophisticated brand logo must be added along the trunks of the elephants. This implies a visible, stylized emblem or symbol placed on the trunk area, consistent with luxury branding aesthetics such as clean lines or metallic finishes.
Question: Is there a clearly visible brand logo placed along the trunk of each elephant?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A minimalist fragrance name label must be added for a luxurious product presentation. This suggests a simple, elegant text element—likely in a refined font—placed on the body of the bottle, possibly near the base or side.
Question: Is there a minimalist label with a fragrance name visible on the body of each bottle?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The overall transformation must maintain a luxurious and refined aesthetic. This includes consistent use of materials (e.g., gold accents, glass-like surfaces), proportionality, and elegance in design elements such as curves, textures, and typography.
Question: Does the edited image present a cohesive, high-end luxury aesthetic consistent with premium fragrance packaging?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
