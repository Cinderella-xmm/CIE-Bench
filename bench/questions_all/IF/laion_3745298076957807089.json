      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies replacing the original black bottle cap with an elegant glass stopper. This implies a change in material (from plastic/rubber to glass), shape (likely more refined and transparent), and aesthetic (elegant). A glass stopper should be visually distinct from the current black cap.",
      "question": "Has the black bottle cap been replaced with a transparent or translucent glass stopper?",

      "thinking_process": "The label must now feature an art deco design, which includes geometric patterns, symmetry, bold lines, and stylized typography—distinct from the current circular logo and text layout. The visual style must reflect this specific artistic movement.",

      "thinking_process": "The branding color scheme must be changed to a rich emerald green and gold combination. This means the dominant colors on the label and any visible branding elements should now include these two hues, replacing the current gold and black.",
      "question": "Is the label predominantly colored in emerald green and gold, replacing the original color scheme?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall object must be transformed into a luxury home fragrance diffuser. This means the bottle’s function has changed from containing whisky to dispersing fragrance via reeds, which is reflected by the presence of reeds, new cap, and updated labeling. The entire composition should suggest a perfume or aroma product rather than alcohol.",
      "question": "Has the bottle been transformed into a functional-looking luxury fragrance diffuser with all associated components (stopper, reeds, redesigned label)?",

        "Yes",
