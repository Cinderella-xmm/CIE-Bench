- Create an art print series featuring the figure in semi-cartoon style
- Highlight textile patterns with gold leaf accents
- Slightly enlarge the hands for emphasis
- Frame each print with deep indigo borders
- Integrate subtle, hand-drawn floral outlines extending from the robe into the frame for artistic enrichment

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies a "semi-cartoon style," which implies simplified forms, exaggerated features, and stylized lines compared to photorealism. This includes elements like clean outlines, reduced shading complexity, and possibly expressive facial features or proportions. The presence of cartoon-like rendering should be observable in the overall character depiction.
Question: Is the figure rendered in a semi-cartoon style with simplified features and stylized lines?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: "Highlight textile patterns with gold leaf accents" means that the intricate floral and decorative patterns on the robe must have visible gold-colored highlights or metallic sheen applied to them, simulating the appearance of real gold leaf. These accents should stand out against the darker fabric background.
Question: Are the textile patterns on the robe enhanced with visible gold leaf accents?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction requires slightly enlarging the hands for emphasis. This means the hands should appear proportionally larger than they would in a naturalistic representation, but not grotesquely soâ€”just noticeably bigger relative to the body.
Question: Are the hands visibly enlarged compared to their original size in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Each print must be framed with deep indigo borders. This implies a solid, dark blue border surrounding the entire artwork, consistent with the description of "deep indigo." The border should be uniform and clearly defined.
Question: Does the image have a deep indigo border framing the entire composition?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Subtle, hand-drawn floral outlines must extend from the robe into the frame. This means delicate line drawings of flowers or botanical elements should originate from the patterned robe and flow outward into the border area, suggesting continuity between the garment and the frame. These lines should resemble sketch-like or illustrative strokes.
Question: Are there subtle, hand-drawn floral outlines extending from the robe into the frame?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
