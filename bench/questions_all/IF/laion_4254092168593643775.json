      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the entire image into an energy drink label design. This implies that the composition should resemble a product label, with clear branding elements, visual hierarchy, and layout typical of beverage packaging. The presence of a border or frame around the content would indicate this transformation.",

      "thinking_process": "The rider’s action must be rendered in a minimalist silhouette style, meaning simplified shapes, reduced detail, and likely high contrast between the figure and background. This is distinct from a realistic depiction.",
      "question": "Is the motocross rider depicted as a simplified, high-contrast silhouette with minimal detail, emphasizing form over texture?",

      "question": "Is there a speedometer icon located at the bottom of the image, showing a needle pointing to the maximum speed?",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall narrative must convey power and speed. This can be evaluated through visual cues such as motion lines, high contrast, dynamic angles, and energetic color palette. The combination of all elements should create a sense of adrenaline and performance.",
      "question": "Do the combined visual elements—silhouette, streaks, typography, track, and speedometer—collectively communicate a narrative of power and speed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
