      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the Blue Jay into a \"whimsical miniature sculpture,\" which implies a change in material (e.g., ceramic, metal, or painted resin) and scale, not just a digital alteration. The sculpture should appear crafted, possibly with exaggerated or stylized features typical of whimsical art. This requires assessing whether the bird now appears as a solid, non-living object rather than a living creature.",
      "question": "Is the Blue Jay rendered as a miniature sculpture made of a solid material such as ceramic or metal, rather than a live bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly requires placing the sculpture inside a glass dome terrarium. A glass dome must be visible, enclosing the sculpture, and showing transparency and reflections consistent with glass. This is a key containment element that defines the scene’s structure.",
      "question": "Is the Blue Jay sculpture enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction states the sculpture should be placed atop a wooden perch with ivy winding upwards. This requires both a wooden perch (visible wood grain and structure) and ivy vines growing upward along it. The presence and direction of the ivy are critical to fulfill the garden theme.",
      "question": "Is there a wooden perch beneath the sculpture with ivy vines visibly winding upward along it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for surrounding the sculpture with \"tiny, crafted leaves.\" These leaves should be small in scale relative to the sculpture and appear deliberately designed (not natural foliage), suggesting hand-crafted or decorative elements. They should be scattered around the base or near the perch.",
      "question": "Are there small, stylized, crafted leaves placed around the base or near the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction includes a \"miniature, stylized tree stump\" for added texture. This implies a small, artificial-looking tree stump, possibly carved or sculpted, with bark-like texture and reduced size to match the miniature scale of the scene. It must be present and distinct from natural elements.",
      "question": "Is there a miniature, stylized tree stump present in the scene, positioned near the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies using the bird’s vibrant blue and white palette to contrast against an earthy, moss-covered base. This means the base must have a textured, greenish-brown appearance resembling moss, and the sculpture’s colors must remain prominent and vivid against this background.",
      "question": "Is the base of the terrarium covered in a textured, earthy, moss-like material that contrasts with the blue and white colors of the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall scene must evoke a garden theme, which is supported by the presence of ivy, moss, crafted leaves, and a tree stump. The composition should feel like a curated, naturalistic display typical of a garden terrarium. This involves checking if all elements cohesively support the garden aesthetic.",
      "question": "Does the entire scene, including the dome, perch, ivy, leaves, stump, and base, collectively evoke a garden-themed terrarium environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
