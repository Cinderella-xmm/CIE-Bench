Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the elephant to be placed inside an ornate glass display case. This implies visible transparent glass panels, possibly with decorative framing, surrounding the scene. The presence of reflections or refractive effects on the glass surface would support this.
Question: Is the elephant enclosed within a visible glass display case with ornate framing?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies miniaturizing the elephant. This means the elephant should appear significantly smaller than its original scale relative to the environment, especially compared to the surrounding elements like bonsai trees and the display case.
Question: Has the elephant been scaled down to a miniature size relative to the surrounding elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Intricate golden inlays are explicitly mentioned. These should be visible as metallic gold-colored patterns embedded into the surface of the elephant sculpture, contrasting with the wood tone.
Question: Are there visible golden inlays integrated into the surface of the elephant sculpture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Tiny bonsai trees must surround the elephant. These should be small, stylized trees resembling traditional bonsai, positioned around the base or within the scene, contributing to the miniature jungle aesthetic.
Question: Are there multiple tiny bonsai trees positioned around the elephant?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A lush, miniature jungle in vibrant, earthy tones is required. This includes dense foliage, plants, and ground cover in colors such as green, brown, terracotta, and ochre, creating a rich, naturalistic micro-environment.
Question: Is the scene surrounding the elephant filled with a dense, miniature jungle rendered in vibrant, earthy tones?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The base must mimic a smooth, polished stone with engraved floral details. This means the platform should not be plain but instead feature carved floral patterns and a reflective, stone-like texture.
Question: Does the base resemble a smooth, polished stone with visible engraved floral patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The overall theme must convey elegance and cohesion with a natural motif. This can be assessed by whether all elements (glass case, bonsai, jungle, base) harmonize in style and color palette, avoiding visual discord.
Question: Do all elements in the scene—glass case, bonsai, jungle, base, and elephant—harmonize in style and color to create a cohesive, elegant natural theme?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
