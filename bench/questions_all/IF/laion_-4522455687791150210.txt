Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the woman into a Renaissance-inspired marble statue. This requires evaluating whether the human figure has been converted into a stone-like, sculptural form consistent with Renaissance art—characterized by smooth, polished surfaces, idealized anatomy, and classical proportions. The material should resemble marble, not cloth or flesh.
Question: Is the woman depicted as a marble statue rather than a living person?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires repositioning her in an elegant standing pose. This implies a formal, balanced posture typical of classical statuary—such as contrapposto or upright symmetry—with arms and legs positioned gracefully. The pose must reflect elegance and stability.
Question: Is the figure in an elegant, balanced standing pose characteristic of classical sculpture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The saree must be sculpted with intricate folds and flowing lines to convey movement, even though it is now part of a statue. This means the drapery should appear dynamic and realistically rendered in marble, with depth, shadow, and creases suggesting motion.
Question: Are the folds of the saree intricately detailed and rendered to suggest movement and flow?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A classical pedestal must be added beneath the statue. This is a structural element common in Renaissance statues—typically made of stone, with a rectangular or tiered base, supporting the figure.
Question: Is there a classical-style pedestal beneath the statue?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The fabric details of the saree must be rendered in marble texture, meaning the entire drape should appear carved from stone, not fabric. This includes the pattern, border, and pallu—all transformed into stone relief.
Question: Is the saree entirely rendered in marble texture, including patterns and borders?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The jewelry must remain as engraved accents, meaning they are no longer three-dimensional or metallic but instead appear etched or incised into the marble surface, consistent with stone carving techniques.
Question: Are the necklace and earrings represented as engraved or incised details on the marble surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The background must be an ornate palace hall setting, implying architectural elements such as columns, arches, frescoes, or decorative ceilings, typical of Renaissance palaces. The environment should support the statue's context.
Question: Is the statue placed within an ornate palace hall featuring classical architecture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
