      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the pelican into a cartoon-style magnet. This implies a shift from realistic representation to exaggerated, simplified features typical of cartoon art, such as bold outlines, stylized proportions, and a flat or slightly textured appearance resembling a magnet. The key observable feature is whether the pelican now appears stylized rather than lifelike.",
      "question": "Is the pelican rendered in a cartoon-style with simplified and exaggerated features?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly requires exaggerating the beak for comical effect. In cartoon depictions, this typically means increasing the length, thickness, or curvature beyond natural proportions. The beak should appear larger and more prominent than in the original image.",
      "question": "Has the pelican’s beak been visibly exaggerated in size or shape compared to the original?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for bulging eyes to enhance comical charm. This means the eyes should appear larger, rounder, and more prominent than natural, possibly with wide pupils or expressive highlights, typical of cartoon characters.",
      "question": "Do the pelican’s eyes appear noticeably bulging and enlarged for comedic effect?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies using vivid pastels for the feathers. This means the color palette should include soft but bright hues like pale pink, mint green, lavender, or sky blue, differing from the natural gray tones in the original image. The colors must be clearly pastel and not muted or realistic.",
      "question": "Are the pelican’s feathers colored in vivid pastel shades such as soft pinks, blues, or lavenders?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction states that the original texture of the feathers should be maintained despite the stylistic change. This means even though the colors are altered and the style is cartoonish, the feather patterns and fine details (such as layering or striations) should still be visible and consistent with the original texture.",
      "question": "Are the feather textures from the original image preserved in the edited version, even if colors are changed?",

      "thinking_process": "A playful sailor hat must be added on top of the pelican’s head. This includes a recognizable hat shape—likely a rounded cap with a brim and possibly a band or emblem—and it should be positioned properly on the head, not floating or misplaced.",

This involves combining elements like the sailor hat, pastel colors, cartoon style, and wooden background to create a playful maritime theme. The composition should feel light-hearted and decorative, not serious or naturalistic.",
