      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the entire scene into a snow globe. This implies that the original open-air setting must be enclosed within a transparent spherical boundary, with visual cues such as reflections, refraction, or a visible glass surface indicating enclosure. The presence of a dome-like structure is essential to define the snow globe format.",
      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical boundary resembling a snow globe?",

      "thinking_process": "A key requirement is the creation of a stylized 3D ballerina figure inside the globe that mirrors the original dancerâ€™s pose. This means the figure should be present, three-dimensional in appearance, and maintain the same dynamic leaping posture as the original dancer.",
      "question": "Is there a 3D ballerina figure inside the snow globe that replicates the leaping pose of the original dancer?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The Eiffel Tower must appear inside the globe, not just in the background, and it should be accompanied by other miniature Parisian landmarks (e.g., Arc de Triomphe, Notre-Dame). These structures should be scaled down and positioned around the tower to suggest a cityscape within the globe.",
      "question": "Are the Eiffel Tower and at least two other recognizable miniature Parisian landmarks present inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires gently swirling snowflakes around the Eiffel Tower and landmarks. This indicates animated or visually implied motion of snowflakes, which should be clearly visible within the globe, enhancing the wintry atmosphere.",
      "question": "Are there visible swirling snowflakes surrounding the Eiffel Tower and other landmarks inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The globe must be mounted on a classic bronze and glass base with elegant engravings in French script. This requires both material accuracy (bronze coloration, glass transparency) and textual detail (French writing visible on the base).",
      "question": "Is the snow globe resting on a base made of bronze and glass, with visible engravings in French script?",
