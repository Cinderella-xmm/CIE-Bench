Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating a "miniature 3D scene" inside a "wooden shadow box", which implies a framed, enclosed space with depth, visible edges of wood, and a sense of three-dimensionality. This requires observing whether the image is now presented as if viewed through a shallow wooden frame with depth cues such as shadows, perspective, or layering.
Question: Is the figure displayed within a wooden shadow box that creates a 3D miniature scene effect?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states using "pastel tones for the background". Pastel tones are soft, muted colors such as light pink, lavender, mint, or pale peach. The background must not be neutral, bright, or saturated.
Question: Is the background rendered in soft pastel tones (e.g., light pink, peach, mint, or lavender)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction requires "tiny embroidered floral details to the garment". These should be visible on the fabric of the hanbok—especially on the jeogori (top) and chima (skirt)—and appear as fine, intricate stitching patterns resembling flowers.
Question: Are there visible tiny embroidered floral patterns on the hanbok's fabric?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies adding "a delicate fan in her hand". The fan should be held by the figure, likely in one hand, and appear small, ornate, and consistent with traditional Korean aesthetics (e.g., paper or silk with painted designs).
Question: Is a delicate fan present in the figure’s hand?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for "a small, blooming cherry blossom tree behind" the figure. This means a miniature tree with pink blossoms should be visible in the background, positioned behind the figure, contributing to the layered storytelling.
Question: Is there a small blooming cherry blossom tree visible behind the figure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction aims to convey "refined cultural elegance and layered storytelling". This can be evaluated by checking if multiple symbolic elements (hanbok, fan, cherry blossom, shadow box) are harmoniously arranged to suggest narrative depth and cultural richness. Layered storytelling implies visual depth and symbolic meaning beyond just clothing.
Question: Are multiple culturally significant elements (hanbok, fan, cherry blossom, shadow box) arranged in a way that suggests layered narrative and cultural refinement?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
