Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction "cartoonize the worker slightly" implies subtle stylization such as simplified facial features, exaggerated proportions (e.g., larger eyes or softer edges), or smoother lines while maintaining recognizable human form. This is an observable stylistic change that should be detectable in the final image.
Question: Has the worker been cartoonized with slightly exaggerated or simplified features compared to the original photo?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: "Enlarging hands to emphasize tea picking" means the hands should be proportionally larger than natural scale, drawing attention to the action of plucking tea leaves. This is a specific proportional change that can be observed directly.
Question: Are the worker’s hands visibly enlarged in proportion to the rest of the body to emphasize the tea-picking action?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: "Use vibrant green and earthy tones for the fields" requires that the color palette of the tea plantation includes bright greens (e.g., lime, emerald) and warm earth tones (e.g., olive, brownish-green). These colors must dominate the background and foliage.
Question: Do the tea plantation fields display vibrant green and earthy tones as the dominant color scheme?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: "Incorporate gold foil for the sack's logo" implies that the logo on the sack (currently a white rabbit inside an orange circle) should have a reflective, metallic gold appearance, simulating actual foil material. This is a material-based visual change.
Question: Does the logo on the sack feature a gold foil effect, making it appear shiny and metallic?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: "Add vine-patterned borders" refers to decorative borders around the image with leafy, climbing plant motifs—common in eco-friendly or nature-themed art. These should frame the image and be clearly visible.
Question: Are there decorative vine-patterned borders surrounding the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: "Present in a recycled paper album" indicates the final output should visually resemble a physical album made from recycled paper—textured surface, muted tone, possibly visible fibers or grain. This is a presentation context requirement.
Question: Is the image displayed within a textured, recycled paper-style album background or frame?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
