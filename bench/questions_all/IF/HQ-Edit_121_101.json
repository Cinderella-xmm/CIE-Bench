      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the image into a \"decorative stamp series\" in \"paper-cut style\". This implies that the visual elements should resemble cut-out paper art, with clean edges, layered appearance, and possibly silhouetted or stylized forms. The entire composition should look like individual stamps rather than a continuous photograph.",
      "question": "Is the image presented as a series of separate stamp-like elements arranged in a grid or collection format, each resembling a paper-cut design?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies accentuating the floral embroideries with metallic foils. Metallic foils would appear as reflective, shiny areas on the fabric, particularly on the floral patterns, suggesting a gold, silver, or copper sheen that stands out from the base material.",
      "question": "Are the floral embroidery details on the hanbok enhanced with visible metallic foil effects (e.g., shiny, reflective highlights)?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly states to \"enlarge the bow for emphasis\", meaning the bow tied at the front of the hanbok should be significantly larger than its original size in proportion to the garment and figure.",
      "question": "Has the bow on the hanbok been visibly enlarged compared to its original size in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires selecting traditional Korean architecture as the backdrop. While the current image features such architecture, the editing task is to ensure it serves as a background element within the final presentation â€” not just present but integrated into the stamp series setting.",
      "question": "Is the traditional Korean architectural background clearly visible and properly integrated into the overall composition of the stamp series?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies presenting the entire set on an \"embossed leather-bound panel\" for a professional finish. This means the final image should show the stamps mounted on a textured, leather-like surface with raised patterns (embossing), giving a tactile and refined appearance.",
      "question": "Is the entire stamp series displayed on a surface that resembles embossed leather with visible texture and depth?",
