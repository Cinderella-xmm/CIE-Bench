      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the character into a \"stylized keychain\" with a \"chibi medieval knight appearance\". This implies a significant change in scale and style, including exaggerated proportions typical of chibi art (e.g., large head, small body), simplified features, and a miniature form suitable for a keychain. The original image is a full-sized realistic portrait, so the edited version must clearly depict a small, cartoonish figure resembling a knight on a keychain.",
      "question": "Is the character depicted as a small, stylized chibi figure suitable for a keychain?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires the armor to have \"glossy enamel colors\" and \"thick black outlines\", which are hallmarks of a cartoon or anime-style illustration. These elements must be visually distinct—shiny, colorful surfaces with bold outlines—to match the described stylization.",
      "question": "Does the armor feature glossy enamel-like colors with visible reflections and thick black outlines?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly states that the head should be \"oversized\" while still preserving the detail of the curly hair. This means the head must occupy a disproportionately large portion of the figure compared to the body, but the curls and texture of the hair must remain recognizable.",
      "question": "Is the character's head significantly larger than the body, while still showing detailed curly hair?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the character should be \"attached to a small silver chain\", indicating a physical connection between the chibi figure and a metallic chain, likely extending from the top of the figure or its back. This is a functional element of a keychain.",
      "question": "Is a small silver chain visibly attached to the character, suggesting it is a keychain?",

      "thinking_process": "The background must be changed to a \"simple dark velvet background\" to create contrast and emphasize elegance and whimsy. Velvet implies a soft, textured surface, and \"dark\" suggests deep tones like black or navy. The background should not contain architectural details or complex elements seen in the original image.",
      "question": "Is the background a plain, dark, velvet-textured surface without any architectural elements?",
