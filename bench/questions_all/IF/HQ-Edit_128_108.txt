Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the ornate lantern into a candle brand packaging. This means the original lantern must no longer be present as a standalone object but instead reimagined as a product package. The transformation should preserve its form and decorative qualities while shifting its function to packaging.
Question: Is the ornate lantern now presented as a candle brand packaging rather than a hanging light fixture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The intricate pattern design of the lantern must be preserved in the new packaging. This implies that the detailed geometric or floral motifs visible on the original lantern should still be visible and intact on the surface of the packaging.
Question: Are the intricate patterns from the original lantern retained on the exterior of the packaging?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: A metallic embossed logo of a flame must be added. This requires a distinct flame-shaped emblem that appears raised (embossed) and has a metallic sheen, indicating material quality and branding.
Question: Is there a metallic embossed flame logo visible on the packaging?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The marketplace elements—such as spice bowls, people, stalls, and architectural details—must be transformed into decorative texture patterns on the sides of the box. These should not appear as realistic scenes but as stylized, abstracted designs integrated into the packaging surface.
Question: Are the marketplace elements (e.g., spices, figures, stalls) adapted into decorative texture patterns on the sides of the packaging?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The overall color scheme must be enhanced with deep golds and ambers to give a luxurious, rich finish. This involves replacing or overlaying existing colors with warm, opulent tones consistent with premium candle branding.
Question: Has the color scheme been updated to include deep golds and ambers throughout the packaging?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A scented candle silhouette must be included on the front of the packaging. This means a clear, recognizable outline of a candle (likely with a wick and wax body) should be visible, possibly stylized but clearly identifiable.
Question: Is there a silhouette of a scented candle visible on the front of the packaging?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
