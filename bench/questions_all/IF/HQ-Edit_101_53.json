      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the pug into a \"plush, elaborately carved wood sculpture,\" which implies a change in material and form from a living animal to a crafted object. This requires assessing whether the pug is now represented as a solid, sculpted figure made of wood rather than a realistic animal.",
      "question": "Is the pug depicted as a carved wooden sculpture rather than a living dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly states replacing \"lifelike fur\" with \"smooth, polished wood grains.\" This means the texture of the surface must be visibly changed from soft fur to a hard, grainy wood texture. Observing the surface should reveal visible wood grain patterns typical of polished walnut.",
      "question": "Has the fur been replaced with smooth, polished wood grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies using \"walnut tones\" to maintain the original color pattern. This means the color palette should resemble natural walnut—rich browns with variations in tone—while preserving the general color distribution of the original pug (e.g., light tan face, dark muzzle).",
      "question": "Are the colors of the sculpture consistent with walnut tones, maintaining the original pug's color pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires \"etching delicate lines to mimic facial wrinkles and detail features.\" This implies that the wrinkles around the eyes, forehead, and muzzle should be rendered as carved grooves or incised lines, not soft folds of skin.",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and features represented by etched or carved lines rather than soft skin folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies placing the wooden pug on a \"simple black base\" to contrast its rich textures. This requires verifying the presence of a plain, non-decorative black platform beneath the sculpture, distinct from the original cushion.",
      "question": "Is the wooden pug placed on a simple black base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes showcasing craftsmanship through contrast between the rich textures of the sculpture and the base. This implies the base should be plain and dark to highlight the detailed woodwork, without distracting elements.",
      "question": "Does the black base provide a stark contrast to the rich wood texture of the sculpture, emphasizing its craftsmanship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
