Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the walls should become bark-covered limbs, which implies a transformation from smooth log construction to organic, textured tree-like forms resembling natural branches. This requires visible bark texture and limb-like protrusions or irregularities in the wall structure.
Question: Are the walls of the cabin visibly transformed into bark-covered limbs with naturalistic textures and irregular shapes resembling tree trunks or branches?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The windows are instructed to morph into glowing amber eyes. This means the original rectangular window openings must be replaced with eye-shaped features emitting a warm, amber glow, suggesting illumination from within.
Question: Have the original windows been replaced with eye-shaped features that emit a glowing amber light?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The roof is to shift into a leafy canopy extending upward, implying that the original shingled roof has been replaced with foliage such as leaves and branches forming a natural canopy that grows vertically beyond the original roofline.
Question: Does the roof appear as a leafy canopy composed of green leaves and branches, extending upward beyond the original roof structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Vines and moss must be creeping over the structure, indicating organic growth covering parts of the cabin, especially along edges, corners, and surfaces, adding a sense of age and integration with nature.
Question: Are vines and moss visibly growing over the surface of the cabin, including along the logs, roofline, and corners?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Mystical rune carvings must be present along the logs, meaning symbolic or ancient-looking inscriptions etched into the wood, likely with intricate patterns or magical motifs consistent with fantasy themes.
Question: Are there visible mystical rune carvings etched into the logs of the cabin?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The doors must be replaced with animated forest spirit faces that exude emerald energy trails. This implies facial features (eyes, mouth, nose) on the door areas, with dynamic, glowing green energy lines emanating from them, suggesting movement or animation.
Question: Are the garage doors replaced with animated forest spirit faces that have visible facial features and emit glowing emerald-colored energy trails?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
