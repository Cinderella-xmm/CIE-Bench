      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the pyramid’s steps should become armored body segments of a mythical guardian. This implies a transformation where each tier of the pyramid is reinterpreted as a segment of an armored body (e.g., plates or joints), maintaining structural alignment but altering texture and form to resemble biological armor. The key observable feature is whether the steps are now visually distinct as segmented armor rather than just stone stairs.",
      "question": "Are the pyramid's steps visibly transformed into segmented, armored body parts resembling a mythical creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The entrance of the pyramid must be transformed into a mystical eye. This requires replacing the original doorway with an eye-like structure—possibly with an iris, pupil, and glowing or reflective surface—positioned at the top center of the pyramid where the entrance was. The eye should be clearly visible and integrated into the structure.",
      "question": "Is the original entrance of the pyramid replaced with a mystical eye featuring an iris and pupil, positioned centrally at the top?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The surrounding jungle must be transformed into intricate vine-like scales. This means the trees and foliage should no longer appear natural but instead resemble organic, interwoven scale patterns that mimic vines or reptilian skin, possibly with symmetrical or fractal designs. These should cover the area around the pyramid.",
      "question": "Has the surrounding jungle been transformed into detailed, interconnected vine-like scale patterns covering the ground and vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The base of the creature must integrate ancient stone patterns. This implies that the lower portion of the pyramid or the ground beneath it should display carved or embossed motifs reminiscent of Mayan or ancient Mesoamerican art—such as glyphs, geometric designs, or symbolic figures—indicating cultural continuity with the original temple.",
      "question": "Does the base of the creature display visible ancient stone patterns such as glyphs, carvings, or geometric designs consistent with the temple’s style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Luminescent flora inspired by the temple’s details must surround the creature. This means glowing plants or flowers should be present in the vicinity, with colors and shapes derived from architectural elements (e.g., stepped patterns, serpent motifs, or hieroglyphic forms). The glow should be visible and enhance the magical atmosphere.",
      "question": "Are there glowing plants or flowers around the creature that resemble or are inspired by architectural features of the pyramid, such as stepped forms or symbolic carvings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall fantastical presence must be enhanced. This is a holistic requirement, but it can be evaluated by checking if all previous transformations (armored segments, mystical eye, vine-scales, stone patterns, glowing flora) are cohesively integrated into a single mythological entity that appears alive, powerful, and otherworldly. The creature should not look like a disjointed collage but a unified being.",
      "question": "Is the entire structure transformed into a cohesive, mythical guardian creature with all elements (armor, eye, scales, base, flora) harmoniously integrated to create a strong fantastical impression?",
