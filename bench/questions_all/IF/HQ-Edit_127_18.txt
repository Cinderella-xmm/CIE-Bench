Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the entire scene must be transformed into a diorama housed inside a vintage travel case. This implies the presence of a visible case structure (such as edges, clasps, or wood grain) surrounding the scene, with the landscape and elephant appearing scaled down and contained within it. The case should resemble an old-fashioned suitcase or trunk, possibly with leather or metal accents.
Question: Is the entire elephant and savannah scene enclosed within a visible vintage travel case structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The use of "miniature 3D models" implies that the elements in the scene—especially the elephant and acacia tree—should appear smaller in scale, with realistic proportions and depth cues typical of 3D modeling, such as shadows, perspective, and surface detail consistent with digital miniatures rather than full-scale photography.
Question: Do the elephant and landscape elements appear as detailed miniature 3D models with realistic scaling and depth?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Textured resin simulating grass means the ground cover should not be natural grass but instead a crafted material resembling grass through texture and color, likely with a glossy or slightly reflective surface indicative of resin. It should mimic tall savannah grass but have an artificial appearance.
Question: Is the ground covered with a material that resembles grass but has a textured, resin-like finish?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A tiny acacia tree must be present and positioned in the scene to provide visual scale contrast with the elephant. Its size should be significantly smaller than the original tree in the image, suggesting it is part of the diorama setup and not the actual large tree from the original scene.
Question: Is there a small-scale acacia tree placed in the diorama to indicate scale balance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Painted clouds inside the backdrop lid suggest that the sky area is not real but a painted representation on the inner surface of the case lid. This would create depth illusion and separate the sky from the physical model. The clouds should appear flat and stylized compared to real clouds.
Question: Are the clouds in the sky depicted as painted elements on the inner surface of a backdrop lid?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A brass compass must be included as a decorative element on the base of the diorama. It should be clearly visible, metallic in appearance, and positioned on the lower part of the scene (base), contributing to the adventurous theme.
Question: Is there a brass-colored compass placed on the base of the diorama?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
