      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the image into a classical Baroque painting style. This implies the presence of characteristic elements such as dramatic lighting (chiaroscuro), rich textures, emotional depth, and dynamic composition. These features must be observable in the final image.",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit dramatic lighting with strong contrasts between light and shadow, typical of Baroque art?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires enhancing the angelic figure with dramatic ornate garments that have rich textures and deep colors. This means the clothing should no longer be simple white fabric but should feature detailed patterns, folds, and possibly metallic or embroidered details in darker or more saturated hues.",
      "question": "Are the garments worn by the angelic figure elaborately textured and rendered in deep, rich colors rather than plain white?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Gold accents must be added to the wings to emphasize their feathery detail. This means visible golden highlights or tracings along the feathers, not just natural coloring. The wing structure should remain intact but enhanced with metallic tones.",
      "question": "Do the wings feature visible gold accents along the feathers, enhancing their detail without altering their overall shape?",

      "question": "Is the background now a celestial scene with soft, voluminous clouds and visible distant stars?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "A warm, harmonious palette typical of Baroque art includes dominant use of warm tones such as gold, amber, deep reds, and earthy browns, balanced with soft whites and shadows. The color scheme should feel cohesive and elevated, avoiding cool or modern palettes.",
      "question": "Does the overall color palette consist of warm tones such as gold, amber, or deep reds, creating a harmonious and rich visual effect consistent with Baroque art?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The angelic figure’s core identity—such as facial features, hair, posture, and general pose—should remain recognizable despite stylistic transformation. The edit should not distort or alter the subject’s form beyond recognition.",
      "question": "Has the angelic figure retained its original facial features, hair style, and body posture while being stylized?",

        "Yes",
