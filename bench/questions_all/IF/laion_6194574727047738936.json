      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies creating a cookbook cover titled \"Charming Cereal Creations.\" This requires the presence of a clearly visible title text on the image. The title must be positioned above the characters and styled in a whimsical, cartoonish font to match the playful theme. The term \"cookbook cover\" implies a full-frame design with the title as a prominent element.",
      "question": "Is the title \"Charming Cereal Creations\" displayed prominently at the top of the image in a whimsical, cartoonish font?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly states that the chocolate-covered cereal bars must be anthropomorphized into cute characters with distinct expressions and tiny hands. This means each bar must have added features such as eyes, mouths, and small limbs, and these features must vary slightly across the bars to show individuality.",
      "question": "Do all chocolate-covered cereal bars have distinct facial expressions and tiny hands drawn or attached to them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires the characters (cereal bars) to interact with the pink flamingo mug within a narrative scene across the table landscape. This implies dynamic positioning—such as one bar leaning on the mug, another looking toward it, or hands reaching out—creating a sense of storytelling.",
      "question": "Are the cereal bar characters positioned in a way that suggests interaction with the pink flamingo mug, such as touching, pointing, or looking at it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for lively colors that complement the cereal box background. The original image has warm tones (yellow, brown, pink), so the edited version should enhance this with vibrant hues—such as bright pinks, yellows, or blues—without clashing with the existing palette. The use of color should contribute to the whimsical mood.",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image vibrant and harmonious, enhancing the whimsical tone while complementing the yellow and green tones of the cereal box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The original objects—the pink flamingo mug, the cereal box, and the wooden surface—must remain recognizable but transformed into part of a narrative scene. This means they should not be removed or drastically altered in shape, but may be stylized or partially integrated into the fantasy setting.",
      "question": "Are the pink flamingo mug, the cereal box, and the wooden surface still clearly visible and recognizable in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
