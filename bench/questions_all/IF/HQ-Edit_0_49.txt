- Miniaturize the ornate teapot into a decorative 3D display within a glass dome
- Position the teapot atop a mirrored base with small porcelain cups encircling it
- Add tiny, detailed engravings on an elevation, amplifying its intricate patterns
- Surround the scene with faux steam spirals winding upwards
- Create a whimsical echo of a steaming brew through the steam effect
- Maintain the original ornate design and metallic appearance of the teapot while scaling down
- Ensure the entire composition is enclosed within a transparent glass dome
- Include small porcelain cups arranged in a circular pattern around the base
- Enhance the engraving details on the elevated surface of the teapot
- Make the steam spirals visually distinct and upward-moving, resembling vapor

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the teapot must be miniaturized and placed inside a glass dome. This implies the presence of a transparent spherical or domed enclosure surrounding the entire display. The glass dome should be clearly visible as a structural element enclosing the teapot and surrounding objects.
Question: Is the teapot enclosed within a transparent glass dome?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the teapot to be positioned on a mirrored base. A mirrored base would reflect the teapot and surrounding elements, creating a symmetrical visual effect. This reflection must be visible beneath the teapot.
Question: Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored base?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that small porcelain cups should encircle the teapot. These cups must be visibly present, proportionally smaller than the teapot, and arranged in a circular formation around the base.
Question: Are there small porcelain cups arranged in a circle around the base of the teapot?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for tiny, detailed engravings to be added on an elevation, enhancing the existing intricate patterns. This means the surface of the teapot—particularly on raised or elevated sections—should show increased detail and fine-line carving beyond the original level.
Question: Are there additional tiny, detailed engravings visible on the elevated surfaces of the teapot, amplifying its existing patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction asks for faux steam spirals winding upward, creating a whimsical echo of a steaming brew. These should appear as soft, translucent, swirling lines rising from the teapot, suggesting heat and movement without being solid.
Question: Are there visible faux steam spirals rising upward from the teapot, forming curved, wispy trails?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
