      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the aircraft into a stylized 3D model. This implies a shift from a photorealistic depiction to a more artistic, geometric, or simplified 3D rendering style, possibly with visible edges, shading, or surface textures consistent with digital modeling.",
      "question": "Is the aircraft rendered in a stylized 3D model form rather than a photorealistic representation?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The aircraft must be enclosed within a vintage aviator's glass display case. This means the plane should no longer be flying freely in the sky but instead be contained within a transparent enclosure that resembles a museum or collector's case.",
      "question": "Is the aircraft fully encased within a glass display case?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Miniature clouds must be included inside the case to create a sense of depth and atmosphere. These should be small-scale cloud models positioned within the glass enclosure, not part of the background sky.",
      "question": "Are there small, artificial clouds placed inside the glass display case?",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The plane must be positioned diagonally upward to convey motion and dynamism. This refers to the orientation of the aircraft within the caseâ€”tilted upward from lower left to upper right or vice versa.",
      "question": "Is the aircraft oriented diagonally upward within the display case?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "Tiny spinning propellers must be integrated to suggest flight. This means the propellers should appear animated or blurred in motion, even if static in the image, to imply rotation.",
      "question": "Do the propellers of the aircraft show visual effects indicating they are spinning (e.g., motion blur or rotational distortion)?",
