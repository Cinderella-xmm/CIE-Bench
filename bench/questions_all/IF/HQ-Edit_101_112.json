      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the image into a traditional Japanese woodblock print. This style is characterized by flat areas of color, bold outlines, limited shading, and a lack of perspective depth. It also typically features strong contrast and stylized natural elements. Therefore, the question must verify whether the visual style matches these defining traits.",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit flat color fields, bold outlines, and minimal shading consistent with traditional Japanese woodblock prints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the figure should be depicted in serene contemplation. This implies a calm facial expression, closed or half-closed eyes, still posture, and possibly a meditative pose. These are observable attributes that can be evaluated directly.",
      "question": "Is the figure’s facial expression calm and composed, with eyes slightly closed or downcast, indicating serene contemplation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The kimono must be reimagined with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. Traditional woodblock prints often feature elaborate designs such as floral motifs, geometric patterns, or wave patterns in bright, saturated hues. The current kimono appears plain and dark; thus, the edit must include visible ornate details and richer coloration.",
      "question": "Does the kimono display intricate patterns (e.g., floral, geometric) and use vibrant, saturated colors instead of plain dark tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Cherry blossoms and the bridge must be stylized in line with woodblock art conventions—this includes simplified forms, exaggerated shapes, and symbolic representation rather than photorealism. For example, petals may appear as stylized teardrop shapes, and the bridge may have uniform lines and decorative railings.",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms and the bridge rendered with stylized, non-realistic forms typical of Japanese woodblock prints (e.g., simplified petals, symmetrical bridge structure)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "A textured matte finish is required to simulate aged paper. This would manifest as visible grain, subtle imperfections, and a non-glossy surface appearance. This effect contrasts with smooth digital rendering or photographic clarity.",
      "question": "Does the entire image have a visible textured, matte surface resembling aged paper, with no glossy or reflective areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The basket must be simplified as a key cultural item. In woodblock prints, objects are often reduced to essential forms—clean lines, minimal detail, and symbolic presence. The original basket is detailed; the edited version should reflect this simplification while remaining recognizable.",
      "question": "Has the basket been simplified into a basic, stylized form with minimal detail, consistent with traditional woodblock art representations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall composition must remain harmonious, meaning balanced elements, proper spatial arrangement, and cohesive color palette. In woodblock prints, harmony is achieved through symmetry, repetition, and visual rhythm. This can be assessed by checking alignment, spacing, and visual flow.",
      "question": "Is the composition balanced, with elements arranged symmetrically and proportionally to create a sense of visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
