Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the figure into a chibi-style character, which involves significant changes in proportionsâ€”specifically, an oversized head relative to the body. This is a core stylistic requirement of chibi art. The presence of an enlarged head compared to the body is directly observable.
Question: Is the character's head significantly larger than the body, consistent with chibi-style proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction emphasizes facial features and hair texture. In chibi style, facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth are typically enlarged or stylized for expressiveness. Hair texture should be clearly visible and exaggerated. These elements must be visually distinct and enhanced.
Question: Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) visibly exaggerated and prominent in size compared to the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies dressing the character in a vibrant striped shirt that captures the original pattern. The original shirt has a dark base with red and white stripes. The edited version must retain this pattern but make it more vibrant and suitable for a chibi style.
Question: Does the character wear a striped shirt with a vibrant color scheme that matches the original red and white stripes on a dark background?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction requires shaping the character as a smooth, glossy enamel fridge magnet. This implies a uniform, reflective surface with defined edges and a rounded or slightly curved shape typical of magnets. A magnetic backing is implied but not visually observable; however, the material appearance must suggest enamel.
Question: Does the character appear to have a smooth, glossy surface resembling polished enamel, with a defined outline suggesting a magnet shape?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The background must be bright and pastel-colored. Pastel colors include soft shades like light pink, mint green, baby blue, etc. The background should contrast with the character and contribute to a cheerful, playful tone.
Question: Is the background a bright, pastel-colored solid or gradient, enhancing the playful aesthetic?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for playful, exaggerated expressions to enhance charm. In chibi art, this often includes wide eyes, smiling mouths, or other cartoonish emotional cues. The expression should deviate from the neutral look in the original image.
Question: Does the character display a playful or exaggerated facial expression (e.g., wide eyes, smile, raised eyebrows) that enhances charm?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
