Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the image into a "stylized oil painting on a wooden panel." This implies visible brushstroke textures, impasto effects, warm color tones typical of oil paint, and a surface texture resembling wood grain. These are concrete visual features that can be observed.
Question: Does the edited image display visible oil painting brushstrokes and a textured surface resembling a wooden panel?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires an "exaggerated, elongated mustache and beard flowing like water." This means the facial hair should be significantly longer than natural proportions and have fluid, wavy contours suggesting motion, similar to liquid or waves.
Question: Is the mustache and beard visibly elongated beyond natural proportions and shaped to resemble flowing water?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The figure must wear a "dark velvet cloak with golden embroidery detailing." Velvet implies a rich, soft texture with light reflection, and golden embroidery should appear as intricate patterns in gold thread along the edges or surface of the cloak.
Question: Is the figure wearing a dark cloak with visible golden embroidery details?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A "wide-brimmed hat adorned with peacock feathers" is specified. This means the hat should have a broad brim and include at least one identifiable peacock feather, recognizable by its iridescent eye-pattern and fan-like shape.
Question: Does the figure wear a wide-brimmed hat with at least one visible peacock feather attached?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: An "ornate, gem-encrusted brooch" must be present. This implies a decorative pin with multiple embedded gems (such as rubies, sapphires, or diamonds) arranged in a detailed design, likely placed on the cloak.
Question: Is there a clearly visible brooch on the cloak that features multiple gem-like stones in an ornate design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The background must be an "abstract, swirling starry night backdrop." This refers to a non-representational sky filled with stars, swirling patterns, and possibly nebula-like formations, reminiscent of Van Goghâ€™s style or cosmic imagery.
Question: Is the background composed of an abstract, swirling pattern with stars and cosmic elements resembling a starry night sky?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
