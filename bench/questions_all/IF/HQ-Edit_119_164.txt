Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the elephant’s skin to be transformed into a galaxy-patterned texture. This implies visible cosmic elements such as stars, nebulae, and swirling colors (like blues, purples, pinks) resembling deep space. The original elephant skin is solid gray, so the edit must replace it with a pattern that clearly mimics a galaxy.
Question: Does the elephant’s skin feature a galaxy-patterned texture with visible stars, nebulae, and cosmic swirls?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The tusks must be replaced with a nebula-like appearance, meaning they should glow with ethereal colors (e.g., purple, blue, pink), show cloud-like textures, and appear luminous rather than solid white ivory. This transformation must be visually distinct from natural tusks.
Question: Do the elephant’s tusks exhibit a shimmering, nebula-like appearance with glowing, cloud-like textures?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The ears are to be replaced with celestial sails reflecting starry constellations. This means the ears should no longer resemble elephant ears but instead appear as large, sail-like structures made of translucent material with embedded stars or constellation patterns, possibly glowing faintly.
Question: Are the elephant’s ears replaced with vast, sail-like structures that reflect starry constellations and have a celestial appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The trunk must emit a delicate, swirling cosmic mist. This implies visible vapor or energy emanating from the tip of the trunk, composed of particles resembling stardust, light trails, or nebular clouds, suggesting movement and ethereality.
Question: Does the elephant’s trunk emit a visible, swirling cosmic mist composed of glowing particles or nebula-like vapor?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Radiant planetary rings must be added around the legs. These should resemble the rings of Saturn—thin, glowing bands encircling each leg, possibly with subtle color gradients or light refraction effects, positioned at or near the joints.
Question: Are there radiant, glowing planetary rings encircling the elephant’s legs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The feet must be adorned with luminescent star patterns. This means visible star-shaped designs on the soles or surface of the feet, emitting light or having a glowing effect, distinguishable from natural foot texture.
Question: Do the elephant’s feet display luminescent star patterns that glow visibly against the skin?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
