- Create a weathered pirate map background
- Position the treasure chest as the central landmark, highlighted with detailed ink sketches
- Use ropes and nautical elements as decorative borders
- Integrate the ship's mast and sails at corners for thematic cohesion
- Include a legend with symbols representing coins, gems, and pottery, marked in bold, ancient-style typography
- Overlay a compass rose in the bottom-right corner using rich, metallic hues reflective of the coins
- Enrich the image with subtle, intricate motifs like sea monsters
- Maintain the original visual elements (treasure chest, coins, gems, pottery, ropes, ship structure) while transforming them into map elements

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the background into a weathered pirate map. This implies visible texture resembling aged parchment, possibly with stains, creases, or torn edges, and a color palette consistent with old maps (sepia, brown, beige tones). The presence of such features can be objectively verified.
Question: Is the background of the image now a weathered pirate map with aged parchment texture and sepia-toned colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The treasure chest must be the central landmark and rendered in detailed ink sketches. This means it should appear as if drawn with fine lines, possibly in black or dark ink, with shading to suggest depth, and positioned centrally on the map.
Question: Is the treasure chest depicted as a central element in the image using detailed ink sketch style?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Ropes and nautical elements are specified to serve as decorative borders. This means they should be arranged along the edges of the image, framing the map, not just present in the scene but repositioned or stylized to function as border elements.
Question: Are the ropes and nautical elements used as decorative borders around the edges of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The ship's mast and sails must be integrated into the corners of the image for thematic cohesion. This implies that parts of the shipâ€™s rigging and sails are visually placed at the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right corners, forming part of the frame or design.
Question: Are parts of the ship's mast and sails visible and integrated into the corners of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A legend with symbols for coins, gems, and pottery must be included, using bold, ancient-style typography. This means there should be a key or label section with icons and text styled like old scripts (e.g., gothic, runic, or medieval fonts), clearly identifying each item.
Question: Is there a legend present in the image with symbols for coins, gems, and pottery labeled in bold, ancient-style typography?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A compass rose must be overlaid in the bottom-right corner, using metallic hues similar to the coins. This means a directional symbol (like a wind rose) must be present in that location, colored in gold, bronze, or copper tones, matching the visual tone of the treasure.
Question: Is there a compass rose located in the bottom-right corner of the image, rendered in metallic hues similar to the coins?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: Subtle, intricate motifs like sea monsters must be added to enhance the mysterious, adventurous feel. These should be small, stylized creatures (e.g., krakens, mermaids, seahorses) embedded in the background or margins, not dominant but noticeable upon close inspection.
Question: Are there subtle, intricate motifs such as sea monsters visible within the map design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
