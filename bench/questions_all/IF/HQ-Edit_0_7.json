      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies creating a \"miniature chibi-style parrot diorama within a glass dome.\" This implies that the entire scene must be contained inside a transparent spherical or domed structure. The presence of a visible glass boundary or reflection effect is essential to confirm the dome.",

      "thinking_process": "The parrot must be rendered in a chibi style, which typically involves exaggeratedly large head, small body, and simplified features. This is distinct from the realistic style seen in Image A. The transformation to chibi must be evident in proportions and facial features.",
      "question": "Is the parrot depicted in a chibi style with a large head and simplified body proportions?",
