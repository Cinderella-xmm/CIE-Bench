Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the attire into a mosaic inspired by African tribal art while preserving original geometric patterns. This implies that the dress should now appear as a mosaic composed of interlocking shapes with distinct color blocks, resembling traditional African textile motifs but rendered in a tile-like, fragmented style. The pattern must remain recognizable from the original but reimagined in a mosaic format.
Question: Has the dress been transformed into a mosaic-style design using geometric shapes that resemble African tribal art, while retaining the original pattern layout?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The beaded jewelry (necklace and bracelets) must be reimagined as stained glass tiles. This means the beads should no longer appear as small spherical elements but as flat, translucent, colored panels with defined edges and internal details resembling lead lines in stained glass, with vibrant hues and light transmission effects.
Question: Have the beaded necklace and bracelets been replaced with stained glass tile designs featuring vibrant colors and lead-line-like borders?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The landscape background must be converted into a tapestry of warm earth tones representing Africa’s diverse terrains. This includes a stylized, textured appearance with gradients of ochre, sienna, burnt orange, and brown, possibly incorporating abstract representations of savannas, deserts, and hills, rather than photorealistic scenery.
Question: Has the background been transformed into a stylized tapestry of warm earth tones, depicting varied African terrains through texture and color blending?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The colorful hairstyle must be retained but reimagined as a bas-relief sculpture. This means the braids and beads should now appear three-dimensional and raised from the surface, with depth, shadow, and sculptural texture, giving the impression of carved or embossed artwork, while still maintaining their original form and color scheme.
Question: Has the hairstyle been transformed into a bas-relief sculpture style, with visible depth, shadow, and sculpted texture, while preserving its original color and structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The overall composition must maintain cultural authenticity and visual coherence. This implies that despite the artistic transformations, the elements should still feel culturally grounded—mosaic patterns should reflect African aesthetics, stained glass should mimic traditional beadwork colors, and the relief sculpture should honor tribal art forms. There should be no jarring stylistic mismatches.
Question: Does the edited image maintain cultural authenticity and visual harmony across all transformed elements (attire, jewelry, background, hairstyle)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
