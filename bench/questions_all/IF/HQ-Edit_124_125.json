      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies creating a \"yoga-themed art print collection,\" which implies multiple images or cards designed as part of a cohesive series. This requires assessing whether the image is presented as part of a collection format (e.g., card layout, album context) rather than a standalone image.",
      "question": "Is the image formatted as part of a multi-card art print collection, such as a panorama card within a curated set?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for a \"cartoonized serene figure,\" meaning the character should have exaggerated features typical of cartoon styles (e.g., simplified facial features, smooth outlines, stylized proportions) while maintaining a calm expression. This needs to be evaluated by checking if the figure's style deviates from realism toward animation-like rendering.",
      "question": "Is the figure depicted in a cartoonized style with simplified features and smooth lines, rather than photorealistic detail?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The requirement specifies \"calming earth tones\" as the dominant color palette. Earth tones include muted browns, tans, soft greens, and warm yellows—colors that evoke nature and tranquility. The image must not feature bright or jarring colors.",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image limited to calming earth tones such as muted greens, browns, tans, and soft yellows?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes \"elaborately exaggerated posture lines,\" suggesting that the figure’s limbs and body are stretched or elongated beyond natural proportions to convey grace and fluidity. This can be assessed by comparing limb lengths and angles to realistic human anatomy.",
      "question": "Are the figure’s limbs and body posture elongated and gracefully exaggerated beyond natural proportions?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires \"stylized beach elements on panorama cards,\" indicating that the background should include artistic interpretations of waves, sand, rocks, or ocean, rendered in a non-literal, decorative manner consistent with an art print aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that each card should exhibit \"tranquil expressions.\" This means the figure’s facial expression should reflect calmness, serenity, or peacefulness—no tension or emotionality.",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction mentions curating into a \"sleek photo album with textured covers for tactile elegance.\" While this may not be directly visible in a single image, it implies that the presentation includes a simulated album or cover texture, possibly overlaid or framed to suggest physical tactility.",
      "question": "Is the image presented within a frame or layout that simulates a textured photo album cover or tactile surface?",
