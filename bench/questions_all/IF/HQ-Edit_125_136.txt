```
- Title: The infographic must be titled “Astronaut and Space Station Dynamics”
- Style: Use a clean, vector graphic approach with simplified shapes and texturized spacesuit details
- Color scheme: Incorporate flat colors with high contrast; use existing dark blues and whites, plus gold as an accent color
- Content: Illustrate step-by-step movements showing the astronaut’s interaction with the space station using directional arrows
- Text elements: Include “Step 1: Prepare”, “Step 2: Navigate”, “Step 3: Operate” along the bottom of the image
- Layout: Maintain a vertical layout for easy follow-through and clarity
- Visual retention: Keep the existing visual elements — astronaut, Moon, and ISS — but simplify their forms
- Texturization: Add texture to the spacesuit while maintaining its overall shape and structure
- Arrows: Use arrows to indicate movement direction between steps
- Format consistency: Ensure all elements are aligned vertically and clearly ordered

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly requires the title “Astronaut and Space Station Dynamics” to be included. This is a direct textual requirement that can be verified by checking if the title appears at the top or in a prominent position of the image.
Question: Is the title “Astronaut and Space Station Dynamics” present in the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The style must be vector-based and clean, with simplified shapes. This means the original photorealistic elements (like the astronaut suit and ISS) should be stylized into geometric, simplified forms while preserving key features such as the helmet, flag patch, and solar panels.
Question: Are the astronaut, Moon, and ISS depicted using simplified, vector-style shapes rather than photorealistic rendering?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies adding texture to the spacesuit detail while simplifying other elements. This implies that the suit should have visible surface patterns or stitching effects even if the overall design is flattened.
Question: Does the spacesuit include visible textural details such as stitching or fabric patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The color palette must use flat colors with high contrast, including dark blue, white, and gold accents. Gold should be used selectively for emphasis (e.g., borders, highlights).
Question: Are gold accents used in the image to emphasize certain elements such as labels, borders, or arrows?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The content must show step-by-step movements of the astronaut interacting with the station, indicated by arrows. This means there should be at least three distinct motion phases connected by directional indicators.
Question: Are there three sequential stages illustrated with arrows showing the astronaut's movement toward or interaction with the space station?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The text "Step 1: Prepare", "Step 2: Navigate", "Step 3: Operate" must appear along the bottom of the image. These are specific phrases that must be present and correctly labeled in order.
Question: Are the labels “Step 1: Prepare”, “Step 2: Navigate”, and “Step 3: Operate” displayed in sequence along the bottom of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The layout must be vertical to ensure ease of reading and logical flow from top to bottom. All elements—title, illustrations, steps—should align vertically.
Question: Is the entire infographic arranged in a vertical format with elements stacked from top to bottom?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
