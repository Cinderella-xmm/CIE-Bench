- Transform the individual's torso and attire into an oversized figurine
- The figurine should feature a stylized athletic jersey
- Emphasize the "Craft" logo on the jersey
- Use matte-finished black polymer for the shirt material
- Apply elevated, bold colors to the logo
- Include a detachable base resembling a sleek, contemporary stand made of polished metal
- The base should have a subtle reflection
- Maintain the overall proportions and positioning of the original figure while transforming it into a figurine
- Ensure the figurine is clearly distinguishable from a real person (e.g., through scale, material texture, and form)

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the individual's torso and attire into an oversized figurine. This implies a change in scale and form to resemble a collectible or display model rather than a real human. The key observable feature is whether the body appears exaggerated in size and stylized as a figurine.
Question: Is the individual's torso and attire rendered as an oversized figurine with exaggerated proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the figurine to wear a stylized athletic jersey. This means the clothing must be simplified, exaggerated, or artistically reinterpreted compared to the original realistic garment, while retaining its identity as a jersey.
Question: Does the figurine wear a stylized athletic jersey that differs from the original realistic shirt design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The "Craft" logo must be emphasized, meaning it should be visually prominent, possibly larger, brighter, or more detailed than in the original image. This involves checking if the logo stands out due to color, size, or placement.
Question: Is the "Craft" logo visibly emphasized with increased size, brightness, or contrast compared to the original?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The shirt material must be matte-finished black polymer. This refers to a non-reflective, smooth, uniform black surface resembling plastic or synthetic resin, not fabric. Observing the surface texture and light interaction will determine compliance.
Question: Is the shirt material rendered with a matte-finished black polymer appearance, lacking shine or fabric-like texture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The logo must use elevated, bold colors. This means the colors in the logo (such as red, white, blue) should be saturated, vivid, and distinct, standing out against the dark background.
Question: Are the colors in the logo rendered in elevated, bold tones (e.g., bright red, white, blue) that contrast sharply with the black shirt?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A detachable base resembling a sleek, contemporary stand made of polished metal must be present. This includes a separate structural element beneath the figurine, with reflective properties indicating metallic material.
Question: Is there a detachable base beneath the figurine that resembles a sleek, contemporary stand made of polished metal?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The base must have a subtle reflection, indicating a polished surface. This means visible but soft highlights or mirror-like qualities on the base, suggesting metallic finish.
Question: Does the base exhibit a subtle reflection consistent with polished metal?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
