      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the scene into a nostalgic art print with soft watercolor tones. This implies that the image should have a painterly quality with blended, translucent colors typical of watercolor paintings, lacking sharp digital edges or high contrast. The tone should evoke warmth and memory, often achieved through muted hues and soft gradients.",
      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit soft watercolor tones with blended color transitions and a lack of harsh lines?",

      "question": "Are additional floral elements (such as flowers or foliage) visibly added to the background to increase liveliness?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires framing the print with a warm wooden border. A wooden border implies a physical frame made of wood with a natural or stained finish, typically brown or golden-brown, surrounding the artwork. It should be distinct from the image content and contribute to a rustic aesthetic.",
      "question": "Is the image enclosed by a visible warm-toned wooden border that frames the artwork?",
