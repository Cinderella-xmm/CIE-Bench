Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the image of the food processor into a packaging design. This implies that the original appliance should no longer be shown in isolation but instead be depicted as part of a product box. The presence of a box structure around the appliance is essential.
Question: Is the food processor now enclosed within a box-like packaging structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The color scheme specified is metallic silver and matte black. These colors must be present in the packaging design to match the aesthetic of the appliance and fulfill the visual branding requirement.
Question: Does the packaging feature a combination of metallic silver and matte black colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies bold and modern typography. This means the text elements (especially the brand name) should use clean, contemporary fonts with strong visual impact, not plain or decorative styles.
Question: Are the text elements on the packaging designed using bold and modern typography?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The brand name 'Waring' must be prominently displayed. "Prominently" implies it should be large, centrally positioned, or otherwise clearly visible and emphasized compared to other text.
Question: Is the brand name 'Waring' displayed in a prominent position on the packaging?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: An isometric angle illustration of the processor must be included on the box. This means the appliance should be shown from a 3D perspective where all three axes are visible, giving a technical and dimensional appearance.
Question: Is the food processor illustrated on the packaging from an isometric angle?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Exploded view graphics show individual components separated slightly to illustrate how they fit together. This visual technique is used to demonstrate functionality and assembly.
Question: Are there exploded view graphics showing the disassembled components of the food processor on the packaging?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
