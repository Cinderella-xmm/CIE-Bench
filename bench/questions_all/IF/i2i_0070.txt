Q1：
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states changing the background to an African savanna at night. We need to verify if the background depicts the savanna environment during nighttime.
Question: Is the background showing an African savanna scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2：
Thinking process: To ensure the image correctly reflects a nighttime setting, we need an evaluation of lighting and environmental cues.
Question: Is the image set against a dark, night-time sky indicative of nighttime?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3：
Thinking process: The Milky Way is a distinct feature of the night sky and should be clearly visible as instructed. Confirming this ensures compliance with the instruction.
Question: Is the Milky Way clearly visible in the sky above the savanna?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4：
Thinking process: A starry sky is an essential part of the instruction. We need to confirm the presence of stars to adhere to the edit request.
Question: Are multiple stars visible alongside the Milky Way in the sky?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5：
Thinking process: The train and railway tracks need to remain intact and fit within the new background without appearing out of place. This ensures the visual coherence of the edit.

Choices: Yes, No
