Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating a "four-panel art postcard series," which implies that the final output must consist of four distinct panels arranged as a series. This is a structural requirement, not just a stylistic one. Each panel should be visually separate but part of a cohesive set.
Question: Is the image presented as a four-panel layout, each showing a different view of a serene lake?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the person to be illustrated in "cartoon style with enlarged eyes." This involves stylization beyond realism—specifically, exaggerated facial features typical of cartoon art, especially prominent eyes. The original image shows a realistic human figure, so this transformation must be evident.
Question: Does the person in the image have cartoon-style features, including significantly enlarged eyes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies changing the tank top into a "long flowing robe with floral patterns." This involves replacing the current clothing with a garment that is both longer (reaching at least mid-calf or lower) and decorated with visible floral motifs. The original clothing is a short-sleeve tank top and shorts, so this change is substantial.
Question: Has the person’s tank top been replaced with a long flowing robe featuring floral patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction states the posture should be adjusted to "seated and reading." This means the person must be in a sitting position, holding or interacting with a book or similar object. The original image shows the person standing, so this change must be verified.
Question: Is the person depicted in a seated position, actively reading a book or similar object?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for "watercolor for soft landscape transitions," meaning the background scenery—especially the mountains, sky, and lake—should exhibit the characteristic traits of watercolor painting: soft edges, blended colors, translucent washes, and visible brushwork-like textures. This contrasts with the sharp digital photography style of the original.
Question: Are the landscape elements (mountains, lake, sky) rendered in a watercolor style with soft transitions and visible wash effects?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies printing on "textured cream card stock" with "lilac-edged borders." This refers to the physical medium and framing of the artwork. While the digital version may not show texture, the presence of lilac-colored borders around each panel would be observable. The final presentation should reflect these material qualities.
Question: Does the image display lilac-colored borders around each panel, suggesting a printed format on cream card stock?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No

Q7:
Thinking process: The instruction mentions placing the postcards in a "handmade paper album with natural fiber accents." This is a presentation requirement. Even if not visible in the digital version, the final product should include visual cues such as visible stitching, organic textures, or fiber details indicating handmade craftsmanship.
Question: Is the image shown within a handmade paper album that includes visible natural fiber accents?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No
