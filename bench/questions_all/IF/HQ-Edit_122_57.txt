- Transform the ornate vase into a crystal sculpture with clear faceted surfaces that mimic the original shape
- Replace the floral art on the vase with etched crystal patterns in abstract floral designs
- Convert the flowers into an arrangement of delicately carved pastel-colored crystal blossoms, emphasizing transparency and elegance
- Place the entire composition on a minimalist mirrored pedestal to reflect its intricate beauty
- Maintain the overall structure and proportions of the original vase while changing material and design
- Ensure all new elements (crystal vase, crystal flowers, pedestal) are consistent in style and theme (transparency, elegance, clarity)

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the vase into a crystal sculpture with clear faceted surfaces. This requires evaluating whether the vase is no longer made of ceramic or porcelain but instead appears transparent with geometric facets resembling cut crystal, while retaining the general shape and volume of the original.
Question: Is the vase now composed of clear, faceted crystal material that mimics the original shape?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The original vase has painted floral art; the instruction requires replacing it with etched crystal patterns in abstract floral designs. This means the surface should display engraved or laser-cut patterns resembling flowers, not painted ones, and they should be abstract rather than realistic.
Question: Are the decorative panels on the vase replaced with etched abstract floral patterns in crystal, rather than painted figures or scenes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The flowers must be converted into pastel-colored crystal blossoms, meaning they should appear translucent, delicately carved, and colored in soft hues like pale pink, lavender, or mint—consistent with crystal material and not natural organic blooms.
Question: Have all the flowers been replaced with pastel-colored, translucent, intricately carved crystal blossoms?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies placing the entire composition on a minimalist mirrored pedestal. This means the base should be simple in form (e.g., flat, rectangular, unadorned), reflective in surface, and designed to mirror the object above it.
Question: Is the vase placed on a minimalist, flat, reflective mirrored pedestal that shows a clear reflection of the vase and flowers?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The transformation must preserve the original vase’s silhouette and proportions while changing material and decoration. Thus, the height, width, and handle placement should remain similar, even if the surface texture and content have changed.
Question: Does the crystal vase maintain the same overall shape, size, and structural features (such as handles and foot) as the original ornate vase?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
