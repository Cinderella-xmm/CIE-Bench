Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the scene into a Rococo-era ballroom. This requires identifying key visual elements of Rococo style, such as ornate architectural details, curved forms, gilded surfaces, and luxurious interiors. A correct edit must replace the outdoor setting with an indoor ballroom featuring these characteristics.
Question: Has the background been changed to an opulent ballroom with gold-accented decor and ornate chandeliers?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly calls for the woman to wear an elaborate pastel gown with intricate lace and floral embroidery. The original gray tulle dress must be replaced with a pastel-colored, richly detailed garment consistent with 18th-century fashion, including decorative elements like embroidery and lace.
Question: Is the woman wearing an elaborate pastel gown with visible intricate lace and floral embroidery?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction requires reimagining the woman's pose as a graceful dance position typical of Rococo court dancing. This implies a dynamic, balanced stance with arms and legs positioned in a manner suggesting movement or performance, rather than a static or casual pose.
Question: Is the woman posed in a graceful dance position, such as one leg slightly lifted or arms extended in a balletic or formal dance gesture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A powdered wig is a defining accessory of the Rococo era, especially for formal events. The instruction mandates its addition, which means the woman’s modern hairstyle must be replaced with a voluminous, white or off-white powdered wig styled in period-appropriate fashion.
Question: Does the woman have a powdered wig that matches the Rococo era style?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies accessorizing with pearls, which were common in Rococo fashion. This includes necklaces, earrings, or bracelets made of pearls, visibly integrated into the outfit.
Question: Are pearls visible as accessories on the woman (e.g., necklace, earrings, or bracelet)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for a soft, harmonious color palette. This implies the use of muted, complementary pastel tones (such as pale pink, lavender, mint, cream) rather than stark contrasts or dark colors. The overall tone should be delicate and refined, consistent with Rococo aesthetics.
Question: Is the overall color scheme soft and harmonious, dominated by pastel hues and lacking harsh contrasts?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The instruction requires maintaining the woman’s identity and proportions despite major changes in clothing and setting. Her facial features, body shape, and general silhouette should remain recognizable from the original image, even if her appearance is transformed.
Question: Is the woman’s facial structure and body proportions consistent with the original image, despite changes in clothing and setting?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
