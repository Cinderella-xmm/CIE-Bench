      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies converting the lion into a \"stylized, high-contrast silhouette.\" This implies that the lion should no longer be rendered in full color or detail but instead appear as a dark, sharply defined shape against the background, with strong contrast between the lion and its surroundings. A silhouette typically lacks internal detail and is defined by outline and shadow.",
      "question": "Is the lion rendered as a high-contrast silhouette with minimal internal detail and strong edge definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The original background is a natural savannah scene with sky, trees, and grass. The instruction requires replacing this with an \"abstract gradient backdrop,\" which means the background should consist of smooth, non-representational color transitions (e.g., from deep orange to purple or black), not realistic scenery.",
      "question": "Has the background been replaced with an abstract gradient composed of smooth color transitions rather than a realistic savannah landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly asks to \"add detailed grass textures to the foreground.\" This means visible, textured blades of grass should be present in the lower portion of the image, possibly with depth and variation in tone or direction, enhancing realism or visual interest in the front area.",
      "question": "Are detailed grass textures clearly visible in the foreground of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for \"angular acacia tree silhouettes,\" meaning the trees should not have their natural rounded or organic shapes but instead feature sharp, geometric lines and angles. These should be simplified forms placed within the scene to maintain stylistic consistency.",
      "question": "Are the acacia trees depicted as angular, stylized silhouettes with sharp edges and geometric forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The title \"King of the Wild\" must be added in a \"dramatic typeface\" and positioned across the upper section. This implies a bold, impactful font style (such as serif, gothic, or stencil) with strong letterforms, placed at the top of the image. It must not overwhelm the lion, so balance is key—meaning the lion remains visually dominant despite the text.",
      "question": "Is the title \"King of the Wild\" displayed in a dramatic, bold typeface across the upper section of the image without overpowering the lion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes maintaining the lion’s prominence despite all changes. Therefore, even with new elements like text and background, the lion must remain the focal point—centered, large, and clearly the main subject. Its position and dominance should not be compromised.",
      "question": "Is the lion positioned centrally and visually dominant in the composition, ensuring it remains the primary focus despite other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
