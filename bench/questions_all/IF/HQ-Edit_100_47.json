      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the entire landscape into a shadow box diorama. This implies a three-dimensional, enclosed presentation with layered elements, simulating depth through physical separation of layers. A true diorama would not appear as a flat image but rather as a constructed scene within a frame.",
      "question": "Is the image presented as a three-dimensional shadow box diorama with visible depth created by layered components?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires layering the skyline and foreground using multiple paper cut-outs to create depth. This means distinct visual planes should be apparent, resembling cut paper sheets stacked at different depths.",
      "question": "Are the skyline and foreground elements visibly separated into multiple layered paper cut-out sections to simulate depth?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The lawn in the original image must be replaced with a mirror-like surface. This requires a reflective, smooth, possibly glassy or polished appearance that mirrors surrounding elements or sky.",
      "question": "Has the grassy lawn area been replaced with a reflective, mirror-like surface that shows reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Tiny 3D-printed pedestrians are specified, implying small, detailed human figures with a tangible, sculptural quality, likely placed across walkways and open areas.",
      "question": "Are there numerous small, detailed, three-dimensional-looking pedestrian figures scattered throughout the scene, particularly on pathways and near the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The scene must be encased in a dark-framed shadow box with metallic edges. This suggests a visible border around the image, darker in tone, with shiny or metallic trim along its perimeter.",
      "question": "Is the entire scene framed by a dark border with visible metallic edges, consistent with a shadow box enclosure?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies engraving detailed city names and coordinates finely along the frame. This means text should be present on the frame's edge, legible enough to identify location details such as \"Paris, France\" and geographic coordinates like \"48.8584° N, 2.2945° E\".",
      "question": "Are city names and geographic coordinates visibly engraved along the outer edge of the frame in fine detail?",
