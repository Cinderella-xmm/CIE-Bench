Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies replacing the shoe upper with transparent material showing internal circuitry. This requires verifying whether the original textile upper has been replaced with a clear or semi-transparent surface that reveals visible electronic-like patterns such as circuits or microchips. The transparency should allow visibility of inner components.
Question: Has the shoe upper been replaced with a transparent material that reveals intricate circuitry patterns inside?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The Swoosh logo is explicitly instructed to emit a cool neon blue glow. This means the logo must not only be present but also visibly illuminated in a glowing blue tone, suggesting an active light source effect rather than just a solid color.
Question: Does the Swoosh logo emit a cool neon blue glow?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: A small digital screen must be attached to the strap and actively display dynamic animations. This implies a visible screen element (not just a static image) with motion or changing visuals, likely positioned where the velcro strap is located.
Question: Is there a small digital screen attached to the strap that displays dynamic animations?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for a collapsible digital shoe box with holographic branding and a metallic finish. This object must be present in the scene, visually distinct from the shoe, and exhibit reflective metallic surfaces along with holographic elements (such as floating logos or shifting colors).
Question: Is there a collapsible digital shoe box with a metallic finish and holographic branding visible in the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The digital shoe box must be accented with modern geometric patterns. These should be clearly visible as structured shapes like triangles, hexagons, or lines arranged in a futuristic design, integrated into the box’s surface.
Question: Are modern geometric patterns visible on the surface of the digital shoe box?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The transformation must preserve the sneaker's core structure and proportions while turning it into a futuristic tech gadget. This means the shoe’s silhouette, lacing system, heel shape, and general form should remain recognizable despite material and feature changes.
Question: Does the sneaker retain its original structural proportions and silhouette despite the futuristic modifications?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
