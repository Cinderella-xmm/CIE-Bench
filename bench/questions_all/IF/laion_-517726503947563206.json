      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the cruise ship into a \"floating crystal palace\" made of translucent, iridescent crystals. This implies the entire structure should no longer resemble a conventional metal or painted vessel but instead be composed of crystal-like materials that refract light and exhibit rainbow-like sheen. The visual transformation must be complete across all major components.",
      "question": "Has the entire cruise ship been replaced with translucent, iridescent crystal structures that resemble a palace?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The hull of the original ship is a solid white structure. The instruction explicitly requires replacing it with \"clear, angular structures and faceted domes.\" This means the base shape must be geometrically restructured into sharp angles and dome-like facets, not smooth curves or traditional hull forms.",
      "question": "Has the hull been replaced with clear, angular, and faceted crystal structures rather than a smooth, solid form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The original windows are rectangular openings in the ship's side. The instruction requires reimagining them as \"multifaceted gems,\" meaning each window should now appear as a cut gemstone with multiple reflective surfaces, not flat glass panes.",
      "question": "Have all windows been transformed into multifaceted gem-like elements with visible facets and reflective properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The decks of the original ship are flat, open areas with railings. The instruction specifies reimagining them as \"intricate crystal paths,\" implying they should now consist of detailed, transparent crystal walkways with ornate patterns or lattice designs, not standard wooden or metal flooring.",
      "question": "Have the decks been replaced with intricate, transparent crystal pathways featuring detailed patterns or latticework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The background in the original image features numerous karst islands and a complex seascape. The instruction calls for a \"minimalist horizon,\" which means the background should be simplifiedâ€”likely to a plain sky and water line without distracting landforms or additional vessels.",
      "question": "Has the background been simplified to a minimalist horizon with no visible islands or complex terrain, emphasizing the crystal ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes that the contrast between the ship and its surroundings should highlight the \"shimmering crystalline architecture.\" This means the lighting and color palette must enhance the sparkle and translucency of the crystal, likely through high contrast between the bright, reflective ship and a subdued, neutral background.",
      "question": "Is there strong visual contrast between the shimmering, iridescent crystal ship and the minimalist background, enhancing the perception of brilliance and transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
