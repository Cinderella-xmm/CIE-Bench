Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the image into a Mughal miniature painting style, which is characterized by fine detail, flat perspective, intricate patterns, and use of mineral-based pigments. This includes visible brushwork, stylized figures, and decorative borders or framing elements typical of the genre.
Question: Does the image exhibit the visual characteristics of a Mughal miniature painting, such as fine line work, stylized figures, and decorative patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The elephant must be adorned with ornate floral motifs, not just simple garlands. These should be integrated into its skin or harness in a highly decorative, patterned manner consistent with Mughal art, possibly including symmetrical designs and stylized flowers.
Question: Are ornate floral motifs visibly applied to the elephant's body or harness, beyond mere marigold garlands?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The crowd must be transformed into courtly figures, meaning they should appear as nobles or attendants in formal attire, with delicate brushwork and intricate patterns resembling jewelry or brocade textiles, consistent with miniature painting aesthetics.
Question: Are the people in the background depicted as courtly figures with delicate brushwork and intricate jewel-like patterns on their clothing?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The overall style transformation must maintain the original composition—elephant centered, rider atop—but now rendered in miniature painting technique, which includes flattened perspective, no strong shadows, and stylized proportions.
