This is a specific size modification that should be observable by comparing the needle size relative to the hands and other objects like the cup or yarn. In the original, the needles are proportionally small; in the edited version, they must appear significantly larger while still being held by the character.",

This means the texture should resemble knitted stitches or yarn loops rather than woven or quilted fabric. Observers should see consistent knit-like patterns across the material.",
