      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the image into a Qing Dynasty traditional portrait.

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires \"opulent jade jewelry\" to be added. Jade was highly valued in Qing culture and often used in court jewelry.

      "question": "Are there visible pieces of jade jewelry, such as pendants, necklaces, or earrings, that appear opulent and made of jade material?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The hairstyle must be transformed into an ornate headpiece with \"intricate jade hairpins.\" In Qing Dynasty fashion, women wore elaborate headdresses with pins, combs, and decorative elements, often incorporating precious stones or jade.

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The background must be changed to an elegant study with classic Chinese scrolls.

      "question": "Is the background now an elegant study room featuring at least one classic Chinese scroll or wall hanging?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The color palette must include rich reds, golds, and deep greens.

      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image rich reds, golds, and deep greens, consistent with the specified color palette?",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "While the subject's appearance is being transformed, the instruction does not mention altering facial features or posture.

      "question": "Has the subject’s facial features and overall posture remained consistent with the original image, aside from the additions of costume and accessories?",
