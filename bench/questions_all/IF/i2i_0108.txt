Q1:
Thinking process: The figure needs to be rendered in 3D to give the impression of being a three-dimensional model rather than a flat image. This verifies the transition to a 3D model.
Question: Is the character depicted as a 3D half-body figure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The character should emerge partially from what looks like a flat television screen surface, suggesting depth and interaction, confirming the breaking effect.
Question: Does the character appear to be breaking out from a television screen?
Choices: Yes, No

Q3:
Thinking process: The defensive pose with the shield raised is a key action that needs to be preserved. The figureâ€™s arms and shield position should indicate a defensive stance.
Question: Is the character in a defensive shield-raising pose?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The augmented reality display effect implies realistic lighting, shadows, and spatial interactions that make the scene look immersive and lifelike.
Question: Does the image simulate an augmented reality display effect through lighting, shadows, and spatial realism?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The character's original appearance includes costume details, colors, and posture, which should remain consistent throughout the edit.
Question: Has the character's original appearance and posture been maintained while implementing the new effects?
