Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the waterfall into a water spirit with crystalline hair. This implies that the original waterfall must no longer appear as just falling water but instead as a sentient, humanoid-like figure with hair made of clear, shimmering crystal-like strands. The presence of a distinct head and flowing hair structure is essential to confirm transformation.
Question: Is the waterfall replaced by a humanoid-like water spirit with a visible head and flowing, crystalline hair?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The spirit must blend seamlessly with the rocky surroundings. This means the edges of the spirit’s body should not appear abrupt or artificial; instead, parts of the form should merge with or emerge from the rock formations, suggesting natural integration rather than superimposition.
Question: Does the water spirit’s form merge naturally with the rocks around it, without sharp or unnatural boundaries?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The spirit must have a luminescent blue hue. This refers to a visible glow in shades of blue, possibly with soft light emanating from the figure, distinguishing it from the surrounding environment which is primarily green and neutral-toned.
Question: Does the water spirit emit or display a noticeable luminescent blue glow throughout its form?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Vine-like appendages resembling the surrounding foliage must be added. These should resemble plant tendrils or vines growing from the spirit, matching the textures and shapes of nearby ferns or tropical plants, and should include small floral patterns such as blossoms or intricate leaf designs.
Question: Are there vine-like extensions growing from the spirit that resemble nearby foliage and are decorated with delicate floral patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The pool at the base must be replaced with a mystical, glowing basin. This involves removing the natural dark water pool and replacing it with a luminous surface that emits light, possibly with swirling or wave-like energy patterns visible in reflection or motion.
Question: Has the water pool at the base been replaced with a glowing, luminous basin emitting visible energy waves or reflections?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
