Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the compass into a luxury perfume bottle. This implies that the original compass shape must be replaced by a bottle form while preserving key design elements. A "perfume bottle" typically has a distinct neck, body, and cap structure, so the transformation should reflect this structural change.
Question: Has the compass been transformed into a bottle-shaped object with a distinct body, neck, and cap?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies converting the body into a circular glass container while retaining the compass face as an embossed pattern. This means the surface of the bottle’s body should appear transparent or glass-like, with the compass markings visibly raised or engraved on it.
Question: Is the body of the object a circular glass-like container with the compass face visible as an embossed or raised pattern?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The needle of the compass must be replaced with a metal spray nozzle. This is a functional replacement—removing the magnetic needle and replacing it with a component typical of perfume bottles. The nozzle should be metallic, elegantly shaped, and positioned where the needle was.
Question: Has the compass needle been replaced with a metal spray nozzle?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A vintage map-engraved cap must be added. This means the top part of the bottle (cap) should feature intricate engravings resembling old-world maps, such as lines, coastlines, or cartographic symbols.
Question: Does the cap of the object feature an engraving resembling a vintage map?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for a bronze-toned gradient finish to give an antique aesthetic. This refers to a color treatment that transitions across shades of bronze, copper, or aged gold, mimicking the look of aged metal.
Question: Does the object have a bronze-toned gradient finish that gives it an antique appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Minimalist branding must be imprinted around the rim. This implies small, clean text or logo placed near the edge of the bottle (likely on the base or upper rim), without being flashy or ornate.
Question: Is there minimalist branding (such as small text or logo) imprinted around the rim of the bottle?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
