Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the image to be transformed into a cereal box design, which implies a structured layout resembling a product package. This includes visible edges or borders typical of a box, and possibly a front-facing panel with branding elements. The characters must be positioned within this format.
Question: Is the image formatted as a cereal box design with visible box-like structure or paneling?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The original image shows a natural outdoor setting with grass and sky. The instruction specifies replacing it with an urban sports scene containing graffiti-style elements. Graffiti-style elements typically include stylized lettering, spray-paint textures, tags, or street art visuals.
Question: Has the background been replaced with an urban sports scene featuring graffiti-style elements such as spray paint art, street markings, or urban structures?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states adding the bold title “Basketball Breakfast Blitz!” across the top. This is a textual element that must be clearly legible and placed at the top of the image, consistent with cereal box branding.
Question: Is the text “Basketball Breakfast Blitz!” displayed in bold font across the top of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Patrick’s shirt originally has a simple number "3" on it. The instruction requires modifying it into a printed graphic with basketball motifs—such as basketballs, dribbling lines, or court patterns—integrated into the design.
Question: Does Patrick’s shirt now feature printed basketball-themed motifs (e.g., basketballs, hoops, or court designs)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: SpongeBob’s original footwear consists of black shoes. The instruction specifies replacing them with sneakers that have cereal loop patterns, which implies visible loops resembling breakfast cereal shapes (like rings or O-shaped pieces) on the shoe surface.
Question: Are SpongeBob’s shoes replaced with sneakers that visibly feature cereal loop patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for illustrating cereal hoops flying around SpongeBob and Patrick. These should be cartoonish representations of cereal rings in motion, likely floating or spinning near the characters, to reinforce the theme of “cereal” and “basketball.”
Question: Are there illustrated cereal hoops (ring-shaped cereal pieces) depicted flying around SpongeBob and Patrick?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
