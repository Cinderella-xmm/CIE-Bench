This requires evaluating whether the original floral elements (orange and yellow flowers) have been reimagined in a stylized, simplified, cartoonish chibi form while retaining their placement and color vibrancy. Chibi style typically features exaggerated proportions, rounded shapes, and simplified details.",

      "thinking_process": "The original image shows an intricate braided hair design with black, orange, and yellow strands.

This means the braid must be visually incorporated into the chibi headpiece structure, not just left as natural hair.",

      "thinking_process": "The earrings are to be converted into miniature golden chibi-style charms. This implies a reduction in size, simplification of form consistent with chibi aesthetics, and preservation of the original intricate lace-like patterns. They must also be attached to the headpiece.",
