Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the original image of a bag into a postcard format. This implies that the final output should not be a 3D product photo but a flat, rectangular postcard-style representation. The presence of a border or layout consistent with a postcard is essential.
Question: Is the edited image presented as a flat postcard format rather than a 3D product shot?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Minimalist line art means the visual style should consist of simplified outlines and minimal detail, focusing only on essential forms. The bag’s structure, handles, and zippers should be represented through clean lines without realistic textures or shading.
Question: Are the main features of the bag rendered in minimalist line art style with clean, simplified outlines?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The chevron pattern must be emphasized with raised embossing. In visual terms, this means the pattern should appear three-dimensional, possibly through shading, texture, or depth cues that suggest physical elevation from the surface.
Question: Is the chevron pattern visually enhanced to appear raised or embossed?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Gold zippers are explicitly mentioned to be emphasized with raised embossing. This means the zippers should stand out due to depth effects, metallic sheen, or shadowing to simulate a tactile, elevated appearance.
Question: Are the gold zippers depicted with a raised or embossed effect, distinct from the surrounding surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The muted olive tone palette refers to a limited color scheme dominated by soft, subdued shades of olive green, likely without bright or saturated colors. All elements should conform to this tonal range.
Question: Is the entire image rendered in a muted olive tone palette without vibrant or contrasting colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A blank space for messages on the back is required. This implies that the postcard has a reverse side with an unmarked area intended for writing, which should be visible or implied in the presentation.
Question: Does the edited image include a blank area on the back of the postcard suitable for writing messages?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The postcard must be shown as part of a designer stationery set, meaning it should be displayed within a context that suggests it belongs to a curated collection—specifically, housed in a sleek black portfolio.
Question: Is the postcard displayed inside a sleek black portfolio?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: The interior pages of the portfolio must be ivory-colored to provide contrast and highlight the postcard design. This requires verifying that the inner lining or visible pages are clearly ivory in tone.
Question: Are the interior pages of the portfolio ivory in color?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
