- Transform the jeans into a perfume bottle shaped like a flared leg jeans silhouette
- Use transparent glass tinted with denim blue for the bottle material
- Replace the back pockets with embossed metallic branding
- Add a silver button-styled cap to the top of the bottle
- Incorporate lace-up details along the side as a decorative element for aesthetic cohesion
- Maintain the overall flared leg shape and structural proportions of the original jeans in the design
- Ensure the lace-up details are positioned similarly to those on the original jeans (on the outer side of the leg)
- The branding should be visible and raised, resembling metal embossing
- The cap should resemble a silver button in both shape and placement

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the jeans into a perfume bottle that retains the flared leg silhouette. This means the overall shape must be preserved but reinterpreted as a glass bottle. The key visual feature is whether the object now resembles a bottle while maintaining the flared lower legs.
Question: Has the jeans been transformed into a perfume bottle shape that maintains the flared leg silhouette?

Question: Have the back pockets been replaced with embossed metallic branding?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A silver button-styled cap must be added to the top of the bottle. This implies a small, round, metallic-looking cap resembling a button, placed at the top where the waistband would be.

Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
