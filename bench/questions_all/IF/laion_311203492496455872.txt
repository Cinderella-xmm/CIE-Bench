Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the hairstyle into an exaggerated, swirling cotton candy form using pastel pink and blue hues. This requires identifying whether the hair has been replaced with a voluminous, fluffy, candy-like structure that swirls in shape and displays the specified color palette. The original gray hair must be completely replaced by this new form.
Question: Has the hairstyle been transformed into a swirling, fluffy cotton candy form with pastel pink and blue hues?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The clothing must be converted into a stylized 3D paper doll outfit. This implies a shift from realistic fabric to flat, layered, cut-out appearance typical of paper dolls, with sharp edges and possible shadows suggesting depth. Additionally, the suit should have a sleek, glossy finish and bold geometric patterns, indicating a non-realistic texture and design.
Question: Has the suit been replaced with a stylized 3D paper doll version featuring a glossy surface and bold geometric patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The tie must be adjusted to be a vibrant, oversized cartoon-style element with bright, contrasting colors. This means it should be significantly larger than normal proportions, rendered in a playful, exaggerated cartoon style, and use high-contrast, vivid colors unlike the original blue patterned tie.
Question: Has the tie been replaced with an oversized, cartoon-style element featuring bright, contrasting colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction does not mention altering the face or expression, so it is implied that the facial features and expression should remain unchanged. This includes the smile, eye position, skin texture, and head orientation.
Question: Have the facial features and expression of the person remained unchanged from the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The overall transformation must align with the described stylization—cotton candy hair, paper doll clothing, cartoon tie—all of which are highly stylized and non-realistic. The visual consistency ensures that no parts retain realistic textures or proportions when they should be stylized.
Question: Are all modified elements (hair, clothing, tie) visually consistent with their respective stylized forms (cotton candy, paper doll, cartoon) and not mixed with realistic details?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
