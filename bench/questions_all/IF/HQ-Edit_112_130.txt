- The woman must be dressed in a lavish, brocade gown with puffy sleeves instead of a kimono
- The violin should remain present and being played by the woman
- Cherry blossoms must be replaced with elegant roses
- The background must be transformed into an ornate English garden featuring wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues
- The overall scene must convey opulence and tranquility through visual elements such as rich textures, soft lighting, and classical composition
- The style of the image should resemble a Victorian-era painting, including characteristics like detailed brushwork, muted yet rich color palette, and formal composition
- The woman's posture and action (playing the violin) should remain consistent with the original, but adapted to the new attire and setting

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly requires replacing the kimono with a lavish brocade gown featuring puffy sleeves. This involves changing both the garment type and its specific design features—brocade fabric implies intricate woven patterns and richness, while puffy sleeves are a distinct silhouette feature common in Victorian fashion.
Question: Is the woman wearing a brocade gown with puffy sleeves?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The violin is central to the narrative and must remain present and actively played. While the outfit changes, the act of playing the violin must be preserved to maintain continuity of the subject’s action.
Question: Is the woman playing a violin?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The original cherry blossoms must be replaced with roses. This requires identifying floral elements in the scene and confirming they are now roses—specifically elegant ones, which implies full blooms, layered petals, and possibly deep red or pink hues typical of cultivated rose varieties.
Question: Are the flowers in the scene now elegant roses instead of cherry blossoms?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The background must be reimagined as an ornate English garden. Key elements include wrought-iron gazebos (metallic, decorative lattice structures) and marble statues (classical figures or busts). These must be visible and properly integrated into the environment.
Question: Does the background include wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The scene must convey opulence and tranquility. Opulence can be assessed through rich textures (e.g., brocade, polished stone), elaborate architecture, and luxurious materials. Tranquility is suggested by soft lighting, balanced composition, and absence of motion or chaos.
Question: Does the scene exhibit signs of opulence (e.g., rich fabrics, ornate structures) and tranquility (e.g., calm lighting, harmonious composition)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The overall style must reflect a Victorian-era painting. This includes characteristics such as realistic rendering, attention to detail, use of warm or muted tones, soft shadows, and classical composition. It should not resemble modern digital art or anime-style illustration.
Question: Does the image have the visual style of a Victorian-era painting, including detailed brushwork, classical composition, and period-appropriate aesthetics?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
