      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the jersey into a dynamic sports ad poster. This implies that the original image of a flat jersey must be recontextualized into a full promotional poster format, likely including background elements, layout structure, and visual dynamism typical of advertisements.",
      "question": "Has the image been transformed from a flat jersey display into a full promotional poster layout?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies converting the jersey into an anthropomorphic cyclist character. This means the jersey must now resemble a human-like figure with limbs, posture, or implied movement, rather than just a static garment.",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the jersey as an anthropomorphic cyclist character with a body shape and posture?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Facial features must be added specifically on the chest area where the star motif is located. This implies that the star has been replaced or modified to include eyes, a mouth, or other facial elements, forming a face within the chest region.",
      "question": "Are facial features (such as eyes, nose, or mouth) present on the chest area where the star was originally located?",

      "thinking_process": "The existing color scheme includes blue, white, red, and gray. The instruction requires retaining this palette while adding new elements. The colors should remain consistent with the original jersey design.",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image limited to blue, white, red, and gray, matching the original jersey's color scheme?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Stylized motion lines are required to convey speed around the character. These should be visible as streaks, blur effects, or directional lines suggesting movement, especially around the limbs or edges of the character.",
      "question": "Are there stylized motion lines or speed effects visible around the anthropomorphic cyclist character?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The layout must be both structured (organized, balanced) and energetic (dynamic, visually stimulating). This implies a clear composition with visual flow, possibly including gradients, contrast, or layered elements that suggest action without chaos.",
      "question": "Does the overall layout combine structured composition (e.g., balanced elements) with energetic visual cues (e.g., motion lines, strong angles)?",

        "Yes",
