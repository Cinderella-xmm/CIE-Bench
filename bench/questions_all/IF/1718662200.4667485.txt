```
- Create a postcard series featuring the pig in cartoon style
- Adjust the pig's proportions to have a larger head and smaller body
- Design distinct poses: DJing in green sunglasses, dancing with a tambourine, holding a microphone
- Use disco-themed watercolor backgrounds
- Include blank chat bubbles for writing
- Frame the chat bubbles with vivid soundwave patterns
```

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the image should be in "cartoon style," which implies exaggerated features, smooth lines, bright colors, and stylized forms. This is a clear stylistic requirement that must be evaluated based on visual cues such as line quality, color saturation, and character design.
Question: Is the pig rendered in a cartoon style with exaggerated features and bright colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states that the pig's proportions should be adjusted to have a larger head and smaller body. This is a direct geometric transformation requirement that can be verified by comparing the relative sizes of the head and body.
Question: Does the pig have a significantly larger head compared to its body?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction requires multiple distinct poses including DJing with green sunglasses. Since the original image shows the pig DJing but with red sunglasses, this must be checked to ensure the correct color (green) is used in the edited version.
Question: Is the pig wearing green sunglasses while DJing?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the background should be disco-themed and rendered in watercolor style. Watercolor backgrounds are characterized by soft edges, blended colors, and translucent washes, often with visible brushstrokes or texture.
Question: Is the background a disco-themed watercolor painting with soft, blended colors and visible texture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction requires blank chat bubbles framed by vivid soundwave patterns. These are specific graphical elements that must be present and correctly designedâ€”chat bubbles should be empty and outlined with dynamic, wave-like shapes resembling audio waves.
Question: Are there blank chat bubbles present in the image, each framed by vivid soundwave patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
