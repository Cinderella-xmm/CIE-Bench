-Make the clock in this image appear to protrude from the flat wall.
-Form a three-dimensional projection effect.
```

```
Q1： 
Thinking process: The clock should visually extend outward from the wall to create depth, implying a three-dimensional appearance.
Question: Does the clock appear to protrude from the wall surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2：
Thinking process: Shadows help indicate depth and dimensionality when an object appears to stick out from a surface.
Question: Does the clock cast a realistic shadow on the wall behind it?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3：
Thinking process: For a proper three-dimensional projection, the perspective and edges of the clock should be adjusted so they do not align perfectly with the wall plane.
Question: Have the edges of the clock been modified to indicate it is not flush against the wall?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4：
Thinking process: Lighting effects often support the illusion of depth when combined with shadows and perspective changes.
Question: Is there evidence of lighting changes around the clock to enhance its three-dimensional look?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5：
Thinking process: The flat appearance of the original clock should no longer be present, as the edited version should convey a sense of volume extending into the space.
Question: Has the clock maintained a completely flat appearance, or does it now show signs of depth?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No
