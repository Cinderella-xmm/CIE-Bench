Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire scene into an eco-friendly tea brand packaging concept. This implies a shift from a realistic tea ceremony setting to a stylized product presentation. Key indicators include visual framing as packaging, branding elements, and materials suggesting sustainability. The core of this requirement is whether the overall composition now functions as a conceptual package design rather than a traditional scene.
Question: Is the entire scene reimagined as a conceptual tea brand packaging design, where the original tea setup serves as part of the product presentation?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the table should be framed as a tea box lid with engraved leaf patterns. This means the wooden table must visually transform into a lid-like structure with visible engraving details resembling leaves. The transformation must be clear enough to interpret it as a box lid, not just a table.
Question: Is the central table redesigned to resemble a tea box lid with visible engraved leaf patterns on its surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The cups are to be replaced with illustrations of sustainable materials. This implies that the original ceramic cups are no longer present and instead shown as depictions of eco-materials such as bamboo, recycled paper, or bioplastics. These illustrations should be clearly distinguishable from real cups.
Question: Are the original tea cups replaced with illustrated representations of sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled paper, or plant-based plastics?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A tag with the brand name "Zen Autumn Tea" in elegant calligraphy must be added. This requires a visible label or tag element bearing the exact text in a script style resembling traditional calligraphy. The placement should be prominent but integrated naturally into the packaging concept.
Question: Is there a visible tag displaying the text "Zen Autumn Tea" written in elegant calligraphy style?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The teapot must be depicted within a leaf-shaped contour with subtle earthy textures to convey an organic, natural aesthetic. This means the teapot's outline should follow the shape of a leaf, and its surface should feature textures resembling soil, bark, or natural fibers, distinct from the original metallic appearance.
Question: Is the teapot enclosed within a leaf-shaped silhouette and rendered with subtle earthy textures such as wood grain or soil tones to suggest organic origin?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
