      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the ice swan into a fragrance bottle. This implies that the entire structure should now resemble a perfume bottle in form and function, not just a sculptural swan. Key features include a defined body (bottle), a cap (stopper), and possibly a label area. The transformation must maintain recognizable swan shape but repurpose it into a functional bottle.",
      "question": "Is the ice swan redesigned into a complete high-end winter fragrance bottle with a clear bottle body and cap?",

      "thinking_process": "The wings are specifically instructed to be transformed into frosted glass accents. This means the wing areas should no longer appear as natural ice feathers but instead have a translucent, textured, frosted glass appearance, consistent with decorative elements found on luxury bottles.",
      "question": "Are the wings of the swan replaced with frosted glass accents that have a textured, translucent appearance?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The neck is to be converted into a sleek glass stopper. This implies that the neck should now serve as the closure mechanism of the bottle, likely extending upward from the bottle body with a polished, smooth, glass-like finish typical of high-end fragrance stoppers.",
      "question": "Has the swan's neck been transformed into a sleek, polished glass stopper that appears functional as a bottle cap?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies incorporating red, pink, and green decorative elements into the bottle’s design. These should be visible as part of the bottle’s surface or surrounding decoration—such as floral motifs, ribbons, or embedded details—and not just present in the background.",
      "question": "Are red, pink, and green decorative elements visibly integrated into the design of the fragrance bottle itself?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "An iridescent logo must be added, which implies a shimmering, multi-colored reflective effect typically seen on premium branding. This logo should be clearly visible on the bottle or label, not just implied.",
      "question": "Is there an iridescent logo visible on the fragrance bottle or its packaging?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The fragrance must be named \"Winter Glow\" using a festive font style on the packaging label. This requires the presence of text reading \"Winter Glow\" in a stylized, celebratory font (e.g., cursive, ornamental, glittery) positioned on a label element attached to the bottle.",
      "question": "Does the packaging label display the name \"Winter Glow\" in a festive font style?",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall design must convey elegance. This can be evaluated by observing the use of refined materials (like glass, frosted textures), balanced proportions, clean lines, and harmonious color integration. The absence of clutter or low-quality textures supports elegance.",
      "question": "Does the overall design of the fragrance bottle exhibit elegant visual qualities such as refined materials, balanced proportions, and sophisticated styling?",
