      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the woman into a cartoon-style keychain character with a big head. This implies a significant change in proportions, particularly enlarging the head relative to the body, and stylizing the figure in a simplified, cartoonish manner typical of keychain characters. The term \"big head\" refers to a disproportionately large head compared to the rest of the body, common in chibi or toy-like character designs.",
      "question": "Is the woman's head significantly larger than her body, consistent with a cartoon-style character design?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires maintaining the red boots and lace dress. These are distinctive elements of the original image that must remain recognizable despite the transformation. The red boots should retain their color, shape, and position on the feet, while the lace dress should preserve its texture and style.",

      "thinking_process": "The keychain must be made of soft rubber with bold black outlines. This indicates a specific material appearance (soft rubber) and artistic rendering (bold black lines around the character), resembling a rubber toy or charm. The outline should be thick and defined to emphasize the cartoon style.",
      "question": "Does the character have bold black outlines surrounding its entire form, suggesting a soft rubber toy aesthetic?",

      "thinking_process": "The pose must be exaggerated, specifically showing the woman bending over. This means her posture should be bent forward at the waist with her hands near or touching her knees, as seen in the original image, but exaggerated for cartoon effect.",
      "question": "Is the character depicted in an exaggerated bending-over pose, with her torso angled downward toward her legs?",

      "thinking_process": "The background must be a neutral-toned wooden plank surface. This means the setting should no longer include the water, boat, or sky from the original image, but instead feature horizontal wooden planks in muted or natural tones, such as gray, beige, or light brown.",
      "question": "Is the background composed of neutral-toned wooden planks, without any elements of water, sky, or boat?",
