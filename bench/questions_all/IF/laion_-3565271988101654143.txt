Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the smartphone display into a sci-fi mission control interface. This implies replacing the current financial data with futuristic UI elements such as glowing panels, digital readouts, and dynamic controls. The presence of non-financial, high-tech visual elements is essential.
Question: Does the smartphone screen display a sci-fi mission control interface instead of financial charts and stock data?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies retaining core blue accents. Blue must remain a dominant color in both the phone and laptop interfaces, especially in highlights, outlines, and background lighting, consistent with the original image's palette.
Question: Are blue accents still prominently featured in the smartphone and laptop displays?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Animated holographic widgets and floating 3D elements imply that the phone screen should show layered, translucent, or semi-transparent graphical components that appear to float above the surface, suggesting depth and motion.
Question: Are there visible holographic widgets or floating 3D elements on the smartphone screen?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Simulating the screen projecting forward means the display should visually extend beyond the physical boundaries of the phone, possibly using light rays, depth effects, or refractive edges to suggest a projected interface.
Question: Does the smartphone screen appear to project forward, creating a sense of depth or holographic extension beyond the device?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A detailed hand scanning overlay implies that the hand holding the phone has visible biometric scan lines, grid patterns, or thermal imaging effects indicating identity verification.
Question: Is there a visible biometric scanning overlay on the hand holding the smartphone?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The laptop screen must be transformed from financial data to a panoramic futuristic skyline. This includes tall structures, neon lights, flying vehicles, or other signs of advanced urban development.
Question: Does the laptop screen now display a panoramic view of a futuristic cityscape instead of financial charts and world maps?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: Pixel-perfect graphics refer to crisp, high-resolution rendering of the skyline, with clean lines, sharp details, and no blurring—indicating advanced digital art quality.
Question: Does the laptop’s futuristic skyline display feature sharp, clear, and highly detailed graphics with no visible pixelation or blur?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: Seamless narrative continuity means the visual style, color scheme, and thematic elements (e.g., sci-fi motifs) must align between the phone and laptop displays, creating a unified futuristic environment.
Question: Do the smartphone and laptop displays share a consistent sci-fi aesthetic, including color palette, interface style, and thematic elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
