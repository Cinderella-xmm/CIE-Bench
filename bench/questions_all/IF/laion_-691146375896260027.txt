- Transform the wooden dresser into a LEGO masterpiece using primarily brown and gold bricks
- Reconstruct the intricate patterns with small interlocking pieces
- Craft the elegant curves using smoothly joined sloped bricks
- Replace the marble top with gray flat LEGO tiles
- Set the reimagined dresser on a neutral backdrop to emphasize its structural detail and playful reinterpretation
- Maintain the overall shape and proportions of the original dresser
- Ensure all decorative elements (such as brass inlays) are recreated using LEGO bricks
- Preserve the two-drawer structure and ornate frame design
- Use only LEGO-style construction materials, avoiding realistic textures or surfaces

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the dresser into a LEGO masterpiece using primarily brown and gold bricks. This requires evaluating whether the entire structure is composed of LEGO-like interlocking bricks, with dominant use of brown and gold colors, replacing the original wood and metal materials.
Question: Is the entire dresser constructed from LEGO bricks, primarily in brown and gold colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The intricate marquetry and brass inlay patterns must be reconstructed using small interlocking LEGO pieces to mimic the original design. This involves checking if detailed patterns are made from individual LEGO elements rather than painted or textured surfaces.
Question: Are the decorative patterns on the front of the dresser recreated using small interlocking LEGO pieces?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The original dresser has elegant curved sides and legs. The instruction specifies crafting these curves using smoothly joined sloped LEGO bricks. This requires assessing whether the curves are built from angled or sloped LEGO elements instead of smooth continuous surfaces.
Question: Are the curved sides and legs of the dresser constructed using smoothly joined sloped LEGO bricks?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The original marble top must be replaced with gray flat LEGO tiles. This means the surface should no longer resemble natural stone but instead appear as a flat, uniform layer of LEGO tiles in gray color.
Question: Has the marble top been replaced with gray flat LEGO tiles?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction requires setting the reimagined dresser on a neutral backdrop to highlight its structural details. This implies the background should be plain and non-distracting, such as white or light gray, to emphasize the LEGO construction.
Question: Is the dresser placed on a neutral, plain background that does not distract from the LEGO structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The original two-drawer configuration with ornate framing must be preserved in the LEGO version. This includes maintaining the division between drawers and the surrounding decorative borders made from LEGO elements.
Question: Does the LEGO dresser maintain the original two-drawer layout with ornate frame designs around each drawer?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The instruction emphasizes a "playful reinterpretation" using LEGO bricks, which implies that all materials must be visibly brick-based and not realistically rendered. This includes avoiding any smooth or polished surfaces that resemble real wood or metal.
Question: Are all surfaces of the dresser visibly composed of LEGO bricks, with no realistic wood or metal textures?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
