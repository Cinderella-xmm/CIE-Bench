Q1:  
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the original ship and seascape into a miniature 3D nautical globe. This implies that the entire scene must be reshaped into a spherical form, where the ship and ocean are curved to fit the surface of a globe. The original flat perspective must be replaced with a spherical projection.  
Question: Is the ship and seascape rendered as a spherical 3D globe rather than a flat scene?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The globe must be enclosed in a clear glass dome. This means a transparent, hemispherical or full-spherical casing should visibly surround the globe, allowing full visibility while indicating containment.  
Question: Is the miniature nautical globe enclosed within a transparent glass dome?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The glass dome must rest on a polished wooden base. The base should have a smooth, reflective wood finish and be engraved with detailed compass patterns, such as cardinal directions, rose designs, or navigational markings.  
Question: Is the glass dome mounted on a polished wooden base featuring intricate compass engravings?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q4:  
Thinking process: Miniature sea creatures must be present beneath the ship within the globe. These should include small, stylized aquatic animals like fish, jellyfish, or whales, visible in the water below the vessel.  
Question: Are there miniature sea creatures visible swimming below the ship inside the globe?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The waves beneath the ship must appear tiny and ethereal, illuminated by moonlight, suggesting a soft, glowing, translucent quality. They should not resemble normal ocean waves but rather dreamlike, luminous ripples.  
Question: Are the waves beneath the ship depicted as small, glowing, and ethereal, consistent with moonlit illumination?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The sails must be enhanced with delicate fabric textures, such as visible weave patterns, folds, or translucency, indicating fine material like silk or canvas with realistic detail.  
Question: Do the sails display visible delicate fabric textures such as weave patterns or realistic folds?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q7:  
Thinking process: Swirling, ethereal clouds must be suspended inside the dome, separate from the external sky. These clouds should appear soft, luminous, and floating in mid-air within the enclosed space, contributing to a magical atmosphere.  
Question: Are there swirling, translucent clouds floating inside the glass dome, distinct from the background sky?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The overall ambiance inside the dome should feel dynamic due to the presence of moving elements like drifting clouds and glowing waves. This implies visual cues of motion, such as soft gradients, light trails, or layered depth.  
Question: Does the interior of the dome show signs of dynamic ambiance, such as softly moving clouds or glowing wave patterns?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
