      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the entire military truck into a crystal sculpture. This involves replacing the metallic and painted surfaces with reflective, faceted crystal material in emerald and jade tones. The key observable feature is whether the truck's body now consists of geometric crystal planes rather than solid metal panels.",
      "question": "Is the entire body of the truck composed of layered, reflective crystal planes resembling emerald and jade facets?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The original wheels are muddy and made of rubber/steel. The instruction specifies replacing them with transparent quartz that has intricate detailing. This means the wheels should appear clear, with visible internal crystalline structures, not opaque or dirty.",
      "question": "Are the wheels transparent and made of quartz with visible internal crystalline patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly states that the truck should be positioned on a sleek, white marble platform. This implies a clean, polished surface beneath the vehicle that contrasts with the crystal truck and is distinct from the original muddy ground.",
      "question": "Is the truck placed on a smooth, white marble platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The cabin and body must be shaped using layered crystal planes to allow light refraction and color reflection. This means the surfaces should not be flat or matte but instead have angular, multifaceted geometry typical of cut gemstones.",
      "question": "Do the cabin and body surfaces feature angular, faceted crystal planes that reflect and refract light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The transformation must preserve the general shape and proportions of the original truck while changing its material. This includes maintaining the cab placement, cargo area size, and wheelbase alignment, even if rendered in crystal.",
      "question": "Does the crystal truck maintain the original structural proportions and layout of the military truck?",

        "Yes",
