      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the spiral staircase into a serpent creature. This means the overall structure must no longer resemble a functional staircase but instead take on organic, animalistic form. The visual identity should shift from architectural to biological, with clear indications of a serpent’s body.",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the spiral staircase as a serpent creature rather than a standard architectural structure?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The steps of the staircase are instructed to form segmented scales. This implies that each step should visually resemble a scale—possibly overlapping, textured, or arranged in a pattern resembling reptilian skin. The transformation must be evident in the surface detail and shape of the steps.",
      "question": "Do the steps of the staircase appear as segmented scales, forming a pattern consistent with reptilian skin?",

      "thinking_process": "The railing must evolve into a sinuous spine. This indicates that the handrail should no longer be a simple curved barrier but should morph into a backbone-like structure—possibly ribbed, bony, or elongated with vertebrae-like segments, following the curvature of the spiral.",
      "question": "Has the railing been transformed into a spine-like structure with vertebrae or bone-like segments that follow the spiral path?",

      "thinking_process": "Wooden patterns for a skeletal finish suggest that the material appearance should include exposed wood grain, structural beams, or bone-like textures that mimic a skeleton. This could involve visible joints, crossbeams, or hollowed-out sections resembling bones.",
      "question": "Are there visible wooden patterns or textures resembling a skeletal framework integrated into the serpent's body?",

      "thinking_process": "Stone-like ridges along the body imply raised, rough-textured features running along the length of the serpent, possibly mimicking natural rock formations or fossilized elements. These should be distinct from the scales and add depth and ruggedness.",
      "question": "Are there stone-like ridges or raised, rocky textures running along the body of the serpent creature?",

      "thinking_process": "Each spiral must represent an elegant coil, meaning the original helical structure of the staircase should now clearly function as a coiled segment of a serpent’s body, with smooth transitions between coils and a sense of fluid motion.",
      "question": "Are the spirals of the staircase rendered as graceful, continuous coils resembling those of a serpent?",

      "thinking_process": "The final requirement is that the creature exudes a sense of ancient and natural majesty. While subjective, this can be evaluated through observable features such as weathering, earthy tones, organic textures, and grand scale. It should not look modern or artificial.",
