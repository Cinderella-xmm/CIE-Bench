      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the tree into an \"otherworldly arboreal guardian,\" which implies a fantastical, sentient, and possibly mystical appearance. This requires a clear departure from natural realism—elements like glowing features, non-natural materials, and symbolic design are expected. The presence of luminous elements, non-organic textures, and a sense of guardianship (e.g., imposing posture, radiating energy) should be visible.",
      "question": "Does the tree appear as a fantastical, sentient entity with an otherworldly presence rather than a natural tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly replaces regular leaves with \"luminescent ferns.\" This means the foliage must now resemble ferns (delicate, feathery fronds) and emit light, indicating a glow effect that is visible even in ambient lighting. The shape and texture must differ significantly from typical autumnal leaves.",
      "question": "Are the tree's leaves replaced with glowing, fern-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The bark must feature \"intricate silver tribal patterns,\" meaning decorative, geometric, or symbolic designs resembling tribal art, rendered in silver tone. These patterns must be clearly visible across the trunk and possibly branches, not just faint or implied.",
      "question": "Does the tree’s bark display detailed silver-colored tribal or ornamental patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The canopy must morph into \"translucent, shimmering wings\"—this indicates a transformation where the upper part of the tree takes on wing-like forms, semi-transparent in nature, with a reflective or iridescent quality suggesting movement or light distortion. The structure should resemble wings in silhouette and texture.",
      "question": "Has the tree’s canopy transformed into wing-shaped, translucent, and shimmering structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The trunk must be replaced with \"twisting glass-like fibers\"—this means the central support of the tree should no longer be solid wood but instead composed of thin, transparent or semi-transparent strands resembling glass or crystal, arranged in a spiraling or entwined fashion.",
      "question": "Is the tree’s trunk replaced by a structure made of twisted, glass-like fibers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires \"glowing, vine-like tendrils at the base extending into the ground.\" These tendrils must originate from the tree’s roots or lower trunk, emit light, resemble vines, and visibly penetrate or connect to the soil or field. Their glow should contrast with the surrounding environment.",
      "question": "Are there luminous, vine-shaped tendrils emerging from the base of the tree and extending into the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The tendrils must \"resonate with the surrounding field,\" implying visual continuity—such as matching colors, light effects, or patterns between the tendrils and the grass or terrain. This could manifest as shared glow hues, similar textures, or harmonious lighting.",
      "question": "Do the glowing tendrils visually blend or harmonize with the surrounding field through color, light, or texture?",

        "Yes",
