Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating a "gymnastics-themed art postcard set," which implies the final output should be a collection of postcards, not just a single image. This requires assessing whether multiple card-like elements are present, arranged as a set, and themed around gymnastics.
Question: Is the image presented as part of a multi-panel postcard set with a gymnastics theme?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly mentions "highlighting a contortionist's silhouette with a brushstroke effect." This means the figure should appear as a stylized silhouette with visible brushstroke textures, rather than photorealistic rendering. The presence of brushstrokes must be observable in the outline and surface of the figure.
Question: Does the contortionist’s silhouette feature visible brushstroke textures across its form?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction requires enlarging the hands to emphasize grip strength. This is a specific proportional modification that can be objectively assessed by comparing hand size relative to the rest of the body. In the original image, hands are proportionally normal; enlargement would make them noticeably larger.
Question: Are the hands significantly enlarged compared to the rest of the body to emphasize grip strength?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for elongating the legs to create dynamic proportions. This means the legs should appear longer than natural human anatomy, especially when compared to torso and arms, contributing to an exaggerated, artistic stance.
Question: Are the legs visibly elongated beyond natural proportions to enhance dynamic movement?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies using gradients of blue and silver to accentuate form. This refers to color application—specifically, smooth transitions between blue and silver tones over the figure’s body, likely following contours and muscle definition.
Question: Are gradients of blue and silver applied across the figure’s form to highlight shape and contour?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction includes adding action motifs such as swirling ribbons and stars. These are distinct visual elements that must be present in the scene—ribbons should appear flowing, possibly near limbs, and stars should be scattered to suggest motion or energy.
Question: Are swirling ribbons and star motifs present in the image to convey action and dynamism?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No

Q7:
Thinking process: The instruction states that the artwork should be mounted on matt-finish panels with corner-rounded edges, indicating a physical presentation format. This requires the image to appear framed or printed on panels with rounded corners and a non-glossy surface texture.
Question: Is the image displayed on panels with matte finish and rounded corners, resembling collectible postcards?
Choices: Yes, No
A: No
