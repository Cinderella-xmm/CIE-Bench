      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the scene into an Art Deco illustration, which is characterized by geometric shapes, symmetry, bold lines, and flat colors. This implies that natural forms like mountains and trees must be simplified into angular, stylized representations rather than realistic ones.",
      "question": "Are the mountains rendered as geometric shapes with sharp angles and flat surfaces instead of realistic contours?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Trees in an Art Deco style should be abstracted into simplified, often symmetrical forms such as triangles or stepped pyramids, avoiding natural foliage textures. The presence of coniferous or deciduous tree shapes must be replaced with stylized, angular versions.",
      "question": "Are the trees depicted as geometric forms, such as triangular or stepped shapes, with no realistic leaf details?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies rendering the river as a series of radiating parallel lines. This means the water should not appear as a smooth, reflective surface but as a pattern of straight, evenly spaced lines emanating from a central point or following a directional flow.",
      "question": "Is the river composed of a series of radiating parallel lines rather than a continuous, reflective body of water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Art Deco art typically uses bold outlines and solid color blocks without gradients or soft transitions. This means that all elements should have defined edges and uniform fills, eliminating naturalistic shading or atmospheric effects.",
      "question": "Are all elements in the image outlined with bold, clear lines and filled with solid, unshaded colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes symmetry across the mirrored reflections. In an Art Deco context, this would mean the reflection in the water is a precise, geometrically accurate mirror image of the foreground elements, possibly with enhanced symmetry or repetition.",
      "question": "Is the reflection in the water a perfectly symmetrical and geometrically aligned mirror image of the foreground elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The original image features a naturalistic landscape with soft lighting and gradients. The transformation to Art Deco demands elimination of these qualities in favor of stylized, decorative elements. Therefore, any remaining gradient effects or soft transitions contradict the intended style.",
      "question": "Are there any visible gradients or soft shading in the sky, mountains, or water, or are all areas filled with flat, solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "No",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies \"vibrant\" Art Deco, suggesting the use of bright, contrasting colors typical of the style (e.g., gold, teal, crimson, black). The palette should reflect energy and ornamentation, not muted natural tones.",
      "question": "Does the image use a vibrant, high-contrast color palette typical of Art Deco design, including bold hues like red, gold, blue, and black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
