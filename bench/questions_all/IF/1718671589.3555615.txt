Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the building's walls into spiced biscuit panels, which implies a textured, edible appearance resembling gingerbread. This includes visible crumb-like surface details and warm brown tones typical of baked spice dough. The material must clearly differ from stone or concrete.
Question: Are the walls of the building made of spiced biscuit panels with a gingerbread-like texture and color?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The dome must be replaced with a sugar-glazed cinnamon dome, meaning it should have a glossy, reflective surface indicative of sugar glaze, and a warm reddish-brown hue consistent with cinnamon. It should not resemble metal or stone.
Question: Is the dome replaced with a sugar-glazed cinnamon dome that has a glossy surface and warm brown coloration?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Windows and doors must be decorated with intricate icing patterns, suggesting detailed white or colored piped designs similar to those seen on holiday cookies. These should be clearly visible and cover window frames and door edges.
Question: Are the windows and door adorned with intricate icing patterns resembling decorative frosting?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The surrounding trees must be transformed into candy sculptures, meaning their structure should appear sculpted from confectionery materials such as caramel, hard candy, or fondant. Leaves should be sugar-coated and display warm brown tones, not natural foliage.
Question: Are the trees replaced with candy sculptures featuring sugar-coated leaves in warm brown tones?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The entire scene must be placed on a smooth marble slab, which implies a flat, polished, reflective surface beneath the building and trees. This base should contrast with the ground in the original image and serve as a foundation for the candy-themed composition.
Question: Is the entire structure and surrounding elements placed on a smooth, polished marble slab?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
