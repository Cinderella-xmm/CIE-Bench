Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the robot into a futuristic tech gadget advertisement. This implies a shift in context from a model toy to a commercial product presentation. Key visual cues include professional lighting, clean composition, and emphasis on technological features. The overall aesthetic should align with high-end tech marketing.
Question: Is the robot presented in a manner consistent with a futuristic tech gadget advertisement, such as with professional lighting, clean layout, and product-focused styling?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: A glossy metallic finish is explicitly required. This refers to a reflective, polished surface that mimics chrome or brushed metal, enhancing the futuristic look. It should be visible across major body panels, especially where light reflects visibly.
Question: Does the robot’s surface exhibit a glossy, reflective metallic finish across its body panels?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Holographic display elements on the chest are specified. These must be visually distinct—likely translucent, glowing, or layered with animated patterns resembling digital interfaces or data streams—placed specifically on the chest area.
Question: Are there visible holographic display elements located on the robot's chest, characterized by glowing or semi-transparent digital patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A digital interface overlay with control icons is required. This means graphical elements such as buttons, sliders, or menu symbols should be superimposed over the image, likely floating or semi-transparent, indicating interactive functionality.
Question: Is there a digital interface overlay present in the image that includes control icons such as buttons, sliders, or menus?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Sleek branding must be integrated. This refers to visible logos, text, or stylized design elements that suggest a brand identity, typically placed in prominent but unobtrusive locations (e.g., chest, shoulder, or leg).
Question: Is there visible sleek branding, such as a logo or stylized text, integrated into the robot’s design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A detachable, magnetic smartwatch accessory must be positioned on the robot’s arm. This object should resemble a modern smartwatch with a magnetic attachment point, clearly distinguishable from the robot’s original parts.
Question: Is there a smartwatch-like accessory attached to the robot’s arm, appearing detachable and magnetic in design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The background must be sleek black to emphasize the product and create a high-tech ambiance. Any other color or texture would violate this requirement.
Question: Is the background of the image entirely sleek black, without any gradients, textures, or distracting elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: Floating tech interface symbols are required to enhance the futuristic, cutting-edge feel. These could include abstract icons, circuit patterns, or UI elements suspended in space around the robot.
Question: Are there floating tech interface symbols, such as digital icons or UI elements, present in the scene around the robot?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
