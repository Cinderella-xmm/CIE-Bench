```
- Replace the Sphinx's head with a radiant sun disc adorned with hieroglyphic patterns
- Modify the body to have shimmering golden wings extending from its sides
- Infuse the limbs with flowing desert sands that cascade downward
- Add symbolic ankhs glowing in azure on its paws
- Maintain the overall structure and position of the Sphinx within the scene
- Ensure the sun disc is positioned where the head was, maintaining spatial coherence
- The golden wings should be clearly visible and extend symmetrically from the body
- The cascading desert sands should flow naturally from the limbs and appear dynamic
- The ankhs must be placed on the paws and emit a distinct azure glow
- The hieroglyphic patterns on the sun disc should be visible and stylistically consistent with ancient Egyptian motifs

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies replacing the Sphinx's head with a radiant sun disc. This requires identifying whether the original human-like head has been removed and replaced with a circular, luminous disc resembling the sun. The presence of hieroglyphic patterns on the disc must also be verified as an explicit requirement.
Question: Has the Sphinx’s head been replaced with a radiant sun disc featuring visible hieroglyphic patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states adding shimmering golden wings extending from the sides of the body. This requires checking for the presence of wing structures made of golden material, positioned symmetrically on both sides of the torso, and exhibiting a shimmering or reflective quality.
Question: Are there shimmering golden wings extending from both sides of the Sphinx’s body?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The limbs are required to be infused with flowing desert sands that cascade down. This means the arms and legs should visually transition into sand, with a dynamic, flowing appearance suggesting movement downward, consistent with sand erosion or flow.
Question: Do the limbs of the Sphinx show flowing desert sands cascading downward from them?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies symbolic ankhs glowing in azure on the paws. This requires verification that each paw has an ankh symbol present, and that it emits a clear blue (azure) glow, distinguishing it from ambient lighting.
Question: Are there ankhs glowing in azure color located on the paws of the Sphinx?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The transformation must maintain the Sphinx’s general form and placement in the scene while applying all modifications. The sun disc must be in the correct spatial location (where the head was), and the overall silhouette should remain recognizable as a Sphinx despite changes.
Question: Is the Sphinx still positioned in the same location relative to the background elements (such as the pyramid and sunset), with the sun disc correctly placed where the head was?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
