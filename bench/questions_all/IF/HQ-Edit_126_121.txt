Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the central artwork must feature the gorilla holding bananas. This means the image of the gorilla from Image A must be integrated into a cereal box design, with the gorilla clearly visible in the center and still holding the bananas. The presence of the gorilla in the correct pose and context is essential.
Question: Is the gorilla holding bananas depicted as the central artwork on the front of the cereal box?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The title "Jungle Crunch" must be clearly visible on the packaging. This is a direct textual requirement, so the name should appear in a prominent location, likely at the top or center of the front of the box, using a readable font style.
Question: Is the text "Jungle Crunch" displayed prominently on the cereal box?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The color scheme must use vibrant greens and yellows. These colors should dominate the packaging design, especially in the background, borders, or decorative elements. The use of these specific colors is critical to meeting the visual branding requirements.
Question: Are vibrant green and yellow colors used as the primary colors on the cereal box packaging?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Banana motifs and leafy tropical accents are required to reinforce the jungle theme. These should be visible as patterns, borders, or decorative elements on the box, such as illustrated bananas, leaves, vines, or palm fronds.
Question: Are banana motifs and leafy tropical accents present on the cereal box design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The back of the box must include a playful jungle illustration and fun facts about gorillas and their habitats. This requires two distinct elements: an illustrative scene (not just text) and educational content in a format suitable for children or general consumers.
Question: Does the back of the cereal box feature a playful jungle illustration along with fun facts about gorillas and their habitats?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
