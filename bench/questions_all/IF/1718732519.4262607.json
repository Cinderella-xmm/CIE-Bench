      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly requires transforming the hot dog into a LEGO model made of red, yellow, and tan bricks. This involves replacing the realistic hot dog with a constructed, blocky representation using those specific colors. The LEGO construction must visibly resemble a hot dog in shape and proportions.",
      "question": "Is the hot dog replaced with a model made of red, yellow, and tan LEGO bricks?",

      "thinking_process": "The original bottle must be replaced with a mosaic-style ceramic piece. Mosaic style implies small tiles arranged in geometric patterns. The new object should not resemble a glass bottle but instead have a ceramic texture and patterned surface.",
      "question": "Has the original bottle been replaced with a mosaic-style ceramic object?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The mosaic ceramic piece must feature geometric patterns using the same colors as the LEGO hot dog—red, yellow, and tan—to ensure visual harmony. This means the colors must be present and arranged in a patterned way.",
      "question": "Does the mosaic ceramic piece feature geometric patterns in red, yellow, and tan colors?",

      "thinking_process": "Both the LEGO hot dog and the mosaic bottle must be placed on a smooth wooden base. The base should be flat, uniform, and clearly visible beneath both objects to support the display.",
      "question": "Are both the LEGO hot dog and the mosaic ceramic piece placed on a smooth wooden base?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The hot dog's elongated structure must be preserved despite being transformed into LEGO form. This means it should still appear long and cylindrical, consistent with a traditional hot dog shape, even if built from blocks.",
      "question": "Does the LEGO hot dog maintain an elongated, cylindrical shape similar to a real hot dog?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The bottle must have a rounded, artistic look rather than a realistic or utilitarian shape. This implies a departure from the original glass bottle’s straight sides and cap, toward a more sculptural, organic, or stylized form.",
