Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the armrests must morph into curled horn-like structures. This requires identifying whether the original rounded armrests are now visually replaced by curved, horn-shaped forms resembling those of a woodland creature, such as a stag or mythical beast. The horns should be distinct in form and material, differing from leather.
Question: Are the armrests of the sofa transformed into curled horn-like structures?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The tufted patterns on the back and sides of the sofa are described as being replaced with bark-textured scales. This implies a change in surface texture from smooth leather with stitching to rough, segmented bark-like patterns resembling reptilian or tree bark scales.
Question: Have the tufted patterns on the sofa been replaced with bark-textured scales?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The cushions are instructed to become a mossy, leafy mane. This means the three seat cushions should no longer appear as leather pads but instead resemble organic plant matter—green moss, ferns, or leaves—growing upward like a mane along the back of the sofa.
Question: Are the cushions transformed into a mossy, leafy mane?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Glowing emerald eyes must be added above the center cushion. This involves placing two luminous green eyes in the area where the middle back cushion meets the top of the sofa, positioned symmetrically and emitting light to suggest an animated, living presence.
Question: Are there glowing emerald eyes positioned above the center cushion?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Wooden limbs with vine-wrapped claws must extend from beneath the sofa. These should appear as natural-looking wooden legs or appendages emerging from under the frame, wrapped in climbing vines and ending in claw-like tips, suggesting a creature rooted in nature.
Question: Are there wooden limbs with vine-wrapped claws extending from beneath the sofa?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The earth-toned surface should integrate subtle mythical energy, which could manifest as faint glows, swirling mist, floating particles, or soft luminescence around the base or body of the creature-sofa hybrid. This adds a magical quality without overwhelming the realism of the transformation.
Question: Is there subtle mythical energy visible, such as faint glows, ethereal particles, or a mystical aura, integrated into the earth-toned surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The overall structure must maintain the original sofa's general shape and position while undergoing transformation. The fantasy elements should not distort or misalign the basic silhouette of the sofa; it should still be recognizable as a couch, albeit fantastical.
Question: Does the transformed sofa retain the original shape and positioning while incorporating the fantastical elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
