Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the original full-figure portrait into a chibi-style resin bust. Chibi style is characterized by large heads, small bodies, and simplified features. The object must be a bust (head and shoulders only), made to resemble a resin collectible, suitable for tabletop display. This implies a change in proportions, format, and material appearance.
Question: Is the figure now a chibi-style bust with an oversized head and simplified body proportions, suitable for tabletop display?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies an embroidered brown robe with exaggerated patterns. "Exaggerated patterns" implies that the design elements are stylized, larger than life, or more prominent than natural embroidery. The robe should be clearly visible and dominate the attire.
Question: Does the figure wear a brown robe with visibly exaggerated and stylized embroidery patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: A colorful headdress with vivid stripes is required. The term "vivid" suggests high saturation and contrast in colors, and "stripes" indicates clear linear patterns across the headdress. The headdress should be prominent and colorful.
Question: Does the figure wear a headdress featuring vividly colored, clearly defined stripes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The pomegranate must be accentuated with gloss, meaning it should have a shiny, reflective surface suggesting a polished or lacquered finish, typical of decorative resin items. This is a material transformation from matte to glossy.
Question: Is the pomegranate rendered with a glossy, reflective surface that highlights its shine?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Minimalistic facial lines imply simplified features—such as smaller eyes, reduced detail in eyebrows, nose, and mouth—consistent with chibi art style. The face should not retain realistic anatomical complexity.
Question: Does the figure's face feature minimalistic lines with simplified facial features such as small eyes and soft contours?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The bust must sit atop a smooth wooden base. This means a solid, flat, wood-textured platform beneath the figure, consistent with display collectibles. It should be visible and integrated into the composition.
Question: Is the bust mounted on a smooth, flat wooden base?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
