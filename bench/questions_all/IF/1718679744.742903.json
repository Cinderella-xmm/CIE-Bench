    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the crocodile into a pop art masterpiece, which implies a high-contrast, stylized, graphic representation typical of Andy Warhol’s work. This includes flat areas of color, strong outlines, and exaggerated features. Pop art often involves simplification and repetition of forms.",
      "question": "Is the crocodile depicted with flat, solid color regions and exaggerated features characteristic of pop art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly requires bold black strokes outlining the image. In pop art, especially Warhol-style, thick black outlines define shapes and separate color fields. This is a core visual feature that must be present for accurate execution.",
      "question": "Are the edges of the crocodile, hat, and sunglasses defined by bold, continuous black outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies saturating the hat and sunglasses with neon colors. Neon colors include bright, highly saturated hues such as electric pink, lime green, hot orange, or cyan. These should be visibly intensified beyond natural tones.",
      "question": "Are the hat and sunglasses rendered in highly saturated, vivid neon colors (e.g., electric pink, lime green, hot orange)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires converting the crocodile’s scales into repetitive geometric patterns. This means replacing the natural texture with uniform, repeating shapes like squares, diamonds, or circles—common in pop art abstraction.",
      "question": "Have the crocodile’s scales been replaced with a consistent, repeating geometric pattern (e.g., squares, rectangles, or dots)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes vibrant contrast and stylized expression in Warhol’s style. This includes high color contrast between elements, lack of shading, and exaggerated features to create a dynamic, almost comic-like effect.",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit high color contrast between the crocodile, hat, sunglasses, and background, with minimal shading and a stylized, graphic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction implies maintaining the crocodile’s original pose and position while applying artistic changes. The crocodile must still be recognizable in its environment (water), wearing the hat and sunglasses, but now stylized.",
      "question": "Is the crocodile still in the same pose and position as in the original image, with the hat on its head and sunglasses over its eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
