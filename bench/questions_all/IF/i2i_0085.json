      "question": "Does the painting visibly extend beyond its frame to create a 3D effect?",

      "thinking_process": "To blend the wall painting into the real space, the elements of the painting should appear integrated with the room environment. This means observing if parts of the painting seem to merge into the surrounding wall or floor.",
      "question": "Do the elements from the painting visually merge into the room environment, such as appearing on the wall or floor?",

      "thinking_process": "Ensuring the elements integrate seamlessly involves assessing if the transition between the painting and the room appears natural. This means checking for any abrupt edges or obvious separation between the painting and room elements.",
      "question": "Are the transitions between the painting and the room environment smooth without any abrupt edges?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction asks to maintain the original elements within the painting, which means ensuring the core components like trees, water, and the sun remain recognizable even as they extend into the room.",
      "question": "Are the original elements of the painting, such as trees, water, and the sun, still identifiable in the edited version?",
