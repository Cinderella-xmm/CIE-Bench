Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the character into a chibi-style fridge magnet. This implies a significant change in scale and form—specifically, a cartoonish, simplified, and compact representation suitable for a magnet. The key visual cue is the chibi style, which includes an oversized head relative to the body and proportionally smaller limbs.
Question: Does the edited image depict the character with an oversized head and small, stubby limbs characteristic of chibi style?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction requires maintaining the iconic suit and cape. While the style changes, the core elements like the suit's structure and the presence of the red cape must still be visible and recognizable.
Question: Is the character wearing a version of the iconic Superman suit with a visible red cape?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The "S" symbol must remain prominent and rendered in bright primary colors (red, blue, yellow). This is a critical identifier of the character and must be clearly visible and stylistically emphasized.
Question: Is the "S" symbol on the chest clearly visible and rendered in bright primary colors (red, blue, yellow)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies using vibrant blues and reds. These colors are central to Superman’s palette and must dominate the character’s design in the edited version.
Question: Are the dominant colors of the character's suit and cape vibrant shades of blue and red?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Thick black outlines are required to give the image a bold, cartoonish, and playful look typical of chibi art and fridge magnets. This stylistic choice enhances visibility and gives it a graphic quality.
Question: Does the character have thick black outlines around its body, face, and costume elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The final output should resemble a fridge magnet, implying a flat, two-dimensional appearance, possibly with a rounded edge or metallic sheen suggesting magnetism. It should not appear three-dimensional or lifelike.
Question: Does the edited image appear flat and compact, consistent with the appearance of a fridge magnet rather than a full-sized figure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
