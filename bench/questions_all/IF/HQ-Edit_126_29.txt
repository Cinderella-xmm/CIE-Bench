Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire room into a Victorian literature-themed infographic. This implies a shift from a realistic interior to a thematic, informative visual layout that combines literary elements with decorative Victorian aesthetics. Observable features include the presence of textual content, thematic design cues (e.g., books, inkwells, parchment), and an overall layout resembling an infographic rather than a standard living space.
Question: Is the room visually transformed into a thematic infographic with Victorian literature elements, including layout and design consistent with an educational or narrative display?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The clock face must be replaced with an animation of a page-turning book. This is a direct replacement of a functional object (clock) with a symbolic one (book). The animation should be visible and clearly depict turning pages, suggesting motion or dynamic content.
Question: Has the clock face been replaced with a visual representation of a book with animated or implied page-turning motion?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Text snippets about historical timekeeping milestones must be added to the wallpaper. These should be legible, positioned across the wallpaper surface, and contain factual or descriptive content related to timekeeping history (e.g., "Invention of the pendulum clock, 1656").
Question: Are there visible text snippets on the wallpaper that detail historical milestones in timekeeping?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The framed painting above the fireplace must now depict an ancient sundial. This requires replacing the existing landscape scene with an image of a sundial, possibly showing a stone or bronze device with gnomon and hour markings.
Question: Does the framed artwork above the fireplace now display an image of an ancient sundial instead of a landscape?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The clock hands must be redesigned as stylized pens, integrated into the book cover design. This implies that the hands are no longer traditional clock hands but resemble writing instruments, possibly forming part of the bookâ€™s spine or cover decoration.
Question: Are the clock hands visibly designed as stylized pens, incorporated into the book cover illustration on the clock face?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Elegant serif fonts in an art-nouveau style must be used for captions placed throughout the room. Art-nouveau style includes flowing lines, floral motifs, and ornamental lettering. The fonts must be serif-based and appear in multiple locations (e.g., on walls, furniture, or near objects).
Question: Are there captions visible in the room using elegant serif fonts with art-nouveau stylistic elements such as flourishes or organic curves?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
