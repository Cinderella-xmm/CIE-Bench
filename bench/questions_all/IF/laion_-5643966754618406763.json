This implies that the overall shape must resemble an armadillo—specifically with a segmented, armored back formed by the stacked tires. The tires must no longer appear as separate wheels but integrated into a biological-mechanical body.",
      "question": "Is the stack of tires reshaped into a creature resembling an armadillo with a segmented, armored back made from the tire treads?",

      "thinking_process": "Metallic joints within the wheel openings are explicitly mentioned. These should be visible at the points where tires connect or meet, suggesting articulation points in the creature’s body. They should have a metallic appearance, possibly with rivets or gear-like textures.",
      "question": "Are there visible metallic joints located within the openings between the tires, suggesting mechanical articulation?",

      "thinking_process": "The central wheel hubs must be replaced with glowing mechanical eyes. This means the center of at least one tire (likely the topmost) must now feature an eye-like structure emitting light, replacing the original hubcap.",
      "question": "Have the central wheel hubs been replaced with glowing mechanical eyes that emit light?",

      "thinking_process": "The overall design must reflect a steampunk aesthetic. This includes elements like brass or copper tones, gears, rivets, pipes, and industrial detailing. The creature should appear both mechanical and organic, fitting the theme of a guardian ready to move.",

      "thinking_process": "The tires’ tread patterns must remain visible and serve as armor. This means the original texture of the tires should not be erased but repurposed as part of the creature’s protective shell.",
      "question": "Are the original tire tread patterns still visible and used as part of the creature’s armored exterior?",
