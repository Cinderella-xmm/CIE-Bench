      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires adding cogs and gears to the lamp's armature. This involves visible mechanical components such as interlocking gears or cogwheels integrated into the lamp’s joints or shafts. These should be clearly distinguishable from the original ornamental design and must appear functional within a steampunk context.",
      "question": "Are cogs and gears visibly integrated into the armature of the brass lamp?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The book's pages need to unfold like mechanical schematics, implying that the text or page layout should be replaced or overlaid with technical drawings, gear diagrams, or blueprint-style lines. Additionally, the margins of the pages should feature cog-like shapes or repeating gear patterns along the edges.",
      "question": "Do the book's pages display mechanical schematic designs with cog-like margins?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The floral wallpaper must now feature rivet patterns, meaning metallic rivets should be superimposed onto or embedded within the floral design. These should be evenly spaced, industrial in appearance, and consistent with steampunk aesthetics (e.g., brass or copper-colored rivets).",
      "question": "Are rivet patterns present on the floral wallpaper?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies maintaining the warm, vintage leather-and-brass color palette. This means the dominant colors should remain in the range of golds, browns, deep reds, and dark amber—no cool tones or modern color shifts should be introduced.",
      "question": "Are the overall colors of the image dominated by warm tones such as brass, brown, and amber, consistent with a vintage leather-and-brass palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The original lighting direction and composition must be preserved—specifically, the lamp should still cast a focused beam of light onto the open book. Any changes to lighting should not alter this key compositional element.",
      "question": "Is the lamp still casting a focused beam of light directly onto the open book, maintaining the original lighting setup?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
