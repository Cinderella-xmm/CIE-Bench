Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the figurine into a polished wood carving. This implies that the material appearance must change from a soft, possibly plastic or ceramic-like surface to one resembling finished wood—characterized by visible grain, warm tone, and a smooth, reflective finish typical of polished wood. The texture should not resemble fur or synthetic materials.
Question: Does the figurine appear to be made of polished wood, with visible wood grain and a smooth, reflective surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The original black-and-white color pattern must be preserved but achieved using contrasting wood tones. This means dark areas (like the black half of the face) should be rendered in darker wood (e.g., walnut or ebony), while white areas should be lighter wood (e.g., maple or birch). The transition between tones should mimic the original split-color design.
Question: Are the black and white areas of the dog's fur represented using contrasting natural wood tones (dark vs. light)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Smooth, rounded contours are required for realism. This means sharp edges should be softened, and the overall shape should have gentle curves consistent with both anatomical realism and the fluidity of hand-carved wood. The limbs, head, and ears should not appear blocky or angular.
Question: Do the figurine’s contours appear smooth and rounded, avoiding sharp or angular edges?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth must be accentuated with fine carved lines. This implies visible incised details around the eyes, along the muzzle, and possibly etched fur patterns to suggest depth and expression, consistent with detailed wood carving techniques.
Question: Are facial features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth enhanced with visible fine carved lines?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The figurine must be positioned on a minimalist wooden platform. This platform should be simple in design—likely flat, rectangular, or slightly tapered—with a wood texture matching or complementing the figurine. It should serve to elevate and display the piece, emphasizing craftsmanship.
Question: Is the figurine placed on a minimalist wooden platform that matches the carving style and material?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The editing should highlight craftsmanship and contrast with the original bright palette. This implies that the overall aesthetic should shift from a vibrant, cartoonish, or glossy look to a more subdued, natural, and artisanal feel—emphasizing texture, material authenticity, and subtle lighting that enhances wood grain.
Question: Does the image emphasize craftsmanship through natural wood textures, subtle lighting, and a muted color palette compared to the original bright appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
