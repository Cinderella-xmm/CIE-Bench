      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the entire scene into a miniature diorama enclosed in a sleek, modern glass display case. This implies visible boundaries of a transparent case with clean edges and reflections consistent with glass material, separating the scene from the surrounding environment.",
      "question": "Is the car and coastal road enclosed within a transparent glass display case with visible edges and reflections?",

      "thinking_process": "The car must be rendered as a 3D model with metallic red coloring and gradient hues, which means it should have reflective surfaces with color transitions (e.g., from deep red to brighter highlights) rather than flat or matte colors.",
      "question": "Does the car exhibit metallic red coloring with visible gradient hues across its surface?",

      "question": "Are there visible dynamic curves and sharp detail lines present on the car’s bodywork?",

      "thinking_process": "Layered resin is required for the road and cliffs to simulate depth, meaning the terrain should appear translucent or multi-layered with varying opacity and thickness to suggest depth and dimensionality.",
      "question": "Do the road and cliffs appear to be constructed from layered resin, showing visible stratification and depth?",

      "thinking_process": "Micro gravel must be embedded into the road and cliffs to add texture; this implies tiny granular details visible on the surface of these elements, simulating natural roughness.",
      "question": "Are micro gravel textures visibly embedded in the road and cliff surfaces?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "A sunset sky panel must be positioned atop the diorama to complete the composition. This means there should be a distinct, flat or slightly curved panel at the top of the display case depicting a sunset, contributing to lighting and visual balance.",
      "question": "Is there a sunset sky panel placed at the top of the display case, forming part of the diorama’s upper boundary?",

        "Yes",
