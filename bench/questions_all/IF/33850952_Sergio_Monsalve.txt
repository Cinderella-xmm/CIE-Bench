- Transform the building facade into an organic, alien-like structure on a strange planet
- Turn the curves into tentacle appendages
- Add fibrous textures across sections of the facade
- Replace window surfaces with translucent, membrane-like panels
- Detail the metal with iridescent, scale-like patterning
- Incorporate bio-luminescent lines along the edges that emit an eerie glow across the architectural form

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the building facade into an organic, alien-like structure. This implies a shift from rigid architectural forms to fluid, biological shapes resembling living organisms. The key observable feature is whether the overall structure appears non-mechanical and biologically inspired, particularly through the presence of appendage-like protrusions.
Question: Does the building facade now appear as an organic, alien-like structure rather than a conventional architectural design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly requires turning the curves into tentacle appendages. This means that the original flowing lines should be reinterpreted as flexible, limb-like extensions resembling tentacles—distinct in shape, tapering, and possibly segmented or undulating.
Question: Are the curved elements of the building transformed into distinct tentacle-like appendages extending from the structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Fibrous textures suggest a surface composed of interwoven strands or thread-like material, similar to biological tissue or plant fibers. These should be visibly present across parts of the facade, not just implied.
Question: Are fibrous, strand-like textures visibly applied across sections of the building’s exterior?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The windows must be replaced with translucent, membrane-like panels. This implies a loss of glass clarity and a shift toward semi-transparent, pliable materials that resemble biological membranes—possibly with subtle internal veining or texture.
Question: Have all window surfaces been replaced with translucent, membrane-like panels that appear soft and non-rigid?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Iridescent, scale-like patterning on the metal indicates that the metallic surface should now display overlapping, fish-scale-like patterns with shifting colors under light, mimicking biological skin or exoskeletons.
Question: Is the metal surface detailed with overlapping, iridescent scale-like patterns that reflect multiple colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Bio-luminescent lines emitting an eerie glow imply glowing, luminous veins or streaks along the edges of the structure, likely in cool tones such as blue, green, or purple, creating a supernatural ambiance.
Question: Are there glowing, bio-luminescent lines along the edges of the structure that emit an eerie, unnatural light?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
