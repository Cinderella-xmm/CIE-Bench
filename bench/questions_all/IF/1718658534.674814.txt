Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the plush toy into a ceramic figurine, which implies a change in material from soft knitted yarn to hard, smooth ceramic. A glossy finish indicates reflective surface properties, distinct from the matte texture of knit fabric. This requires evaluating whether the object now appears non-porous, shiny, and rigid.
Question: Is the figurine made of a glossy, smooth ceramic material instead of knitted yarn?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The color must be changed to a vibrant terracotta tone, which is a warm reddish-brown hue commonly associated with fired clay. This is distinct from the original beige or light gray of the knit toy. The vibrancy implies saturation and richness, not dullness.
Question: Is the figurine's color a vibrant terracotta tone (a rich reddish-brown)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Intricate floral engravings imply detailed patterns carved into the surface, likely visible as recessed designs with defined edges. These should be present across the body, consistent with decorative ceramic craftsmanship.
Question: Are there visible intricate floral engravings on the surface of the figurine?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The eyes must be remodeled to resemble small polished amber stones. This means they should appear translucent, golden-yellow, and smooth, like gemstones, rather than black plastic beads. Their shape should also be rounded and embedded.
Question: Do the eyes resemble small polished amber stones in color, texture, and appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The figurine must be placed on a simple wooden tabletop, indicating a flat, natural wood surface with minimal decoration. The background should be neutral and uncluttered to support a minimalist presentation.
Question: Is the figurine placed on a simple wooden tabletop with a minimalist background?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
