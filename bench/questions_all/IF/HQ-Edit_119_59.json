      "thinking_process": "The reflection in the mirror is supposed to contain creative shadow illustrations instead of a realistic reflection. This means the mirrored side should not replicate the original scene but instead feature artistic interpretations of shadows—possibly abstract shapes, silhouettes, or symbolic designs related to fitness or strength.",
      "question": "Does the reflection in the mirror display abstract or creative shadow illustrations rather than a realistic depiction of the weightlifter and surroundings?",
