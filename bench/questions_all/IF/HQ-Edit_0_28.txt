Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire scene into a bookmark series, which implies a change in composition and framing to resemble a bookmark—typically narrow, vertical, and designed for text placement. This involves adjusting proportions, removing excess elements, and possibly adding decorative borders or margins typical of bookmarks.
Question: Has the overall scene been resized and framed vertically to resemble a bookmark format?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The robe must be stylized with abstract geometric patterns in muted earth tones (such as beige, olive, terracotta, or brown) to convey sophistication. This means the original fabric texture should be replaced or overlaid with intentional geometric designs without bright or contrasting colors.
Question: Does the man's robe feature abstract geometric patterns rendered in muted earth tones?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The lamps are to be reimagined as "intricate corner flourishes," meaning they should no longer appear as functional table lamps but instead transformed into ornamental, decorative elements positioned at the corners of the image, possibly resembling scrollwork or filigree designs.
Question: Have the lamps been transformed into decorative corner flourishes with intricate design elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The bookcase is to be extended as a textured background with subtle script incorporated. This means the bookshelves should visually expand beyond their original boundaries, possibly blending into the backdrop, and include faint calligraphic or script-like textures that suggest writing or ancient texts.
Question: Is the bookcase extended into a textured background that includes subtle script elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies adding space for inspirational quotes, which implies the presence of blank areas or designated zones—possibly near the top, bottom, or sides—where text can be inserted without overlapping key visual elements.
Question: Are there clearly defined blank spaces or margins in the image suitable for placing inspirational quotes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
