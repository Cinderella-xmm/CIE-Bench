      "thinking_process": "The suit’s pattern (referring to the man’s clothing) should include faint ornate filigree details. Filigree refers to delicate, intricate patterns, often resembling lace or metalwork, typically in fine lines.

      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies maintaining earthy hues for a sophisticated finish. Earthy tones include shades of brown, olive green, deep red, and muted gold—colors derived from nature. The overall color palette should avoid bright or unnatural colors and instead emphasize warm, grounded tones consistent with a vineyard and vintage aesthetic.",
      "question": "Does the image maintain an overall color palette dominated by earthy tones such as browns, greens, and deep reds?",
