- The marble top of the cabinet has been transformed into a royal crown with gemstone inlays
- The body of the cabinet has been morphed into an ornate, patterned robe
- The intricate drawer engravings have become elaborate belt buckles
- The legs of the cabinet have been transformed into regal, clawed feet
- The drawers have been modified to open like functional pouches on adventurer's attire
- The overall transformation maintains anthropomorphic character features (head, torso, limbs)
- The materials and textures are consistent with royal or adventurer-themed attire (e.g., fabric-like patterns, metallic embellishments)
- The original structure is no longer recognizable as a cabinet but instead as a personified figure

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the marble top becomes a royal crown with gemstone inlays. This implies a clear transformation from a flat, polished stone surface into a three-dimensional crown shape, with visible gemstones embedded within it. The crown should be positioned where the top was, and must retain a regal appearance.
Question: Is the marble top replaced by a crown-shaped structure with visible gemstone inlays?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The body of the cabinet must be transformed into an ornate, patterned robe. This requires replacing the wooden paneling with fabric-like texture and decorative patterns resembling clothing. The form should suggest a draped garment rather than a rigid box.
Question: Has the cabinet’s body been replaced with a fabric-like, patterned robe design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The drawer engravings are described as becoming elaborate belt buckles. This means the metal trim and decorative elements on the drawers must now resemble functional or decorative buckles, possibly with embossed details, placed across the waist area of the anthropomorphic figure.
Question: Are the drawer engravings reimagined as detailed, ornamental belt buckles positioned across the midsection of the figure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The legs of the cabinet are to become regal, clawed feet. This implies a change from straight wooden legs to stylized, animalistic or mythical feet with claws, possibly metallic or sculpted, consistent with royal or heroic imagery.
Question: Have the cabinet’s legs been transformed into clawed, regal feet resembling those of a noble creature or warrior?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The drawers are to open like functional pouches on adventurer's attire. This suggests they are no longer fixed drawers but appear as wearable pockets or bags that can be opened and closed, integrated into the robe or waist area.
Question: Do the drawers now resemble openable pouches attached to the robe, mimicking adventurer-style gear?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The entire object must be anthropomorphized — meaning it should visually represent a character with a head (crown), torso (robe), and limbs (clawed feet). The transformation should preserve the general proportions of a standing figure.
Question: Does the edited image depict a standing anthropomorphic figure with a crown, robe, and clawed feet, clearly derived from the original cabinet?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The materials and textures must align with royal or adventurer themes. This includes fabric textures for the robe, metallic accents for buckles and crown, and possibly leather or armor-like finishes for pouches and feet.
Question: Are the materials and textures consistent with royal or adventurer attire (e.g., fabric, gemstones, metal, leather)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
