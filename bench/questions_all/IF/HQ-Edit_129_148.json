      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies creating a miniature diorama inside a vintage globe. This requires the entire scene to be contained within a spherical object resembling an old-fashioned globe, with visible structural features such as a brass stand or aged glass surface. The presence of the globe is essential to fulfill this requirement.",
      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a vintage-style globe?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The figure must be transformed into a stylized 3D model, meaning it should appear rendered with digital modeling characteristics—such as smooth surfaces, defined edges, and consistent lighting—while maintaining its original pose and identity. The \"seated gracefully\" part implies a composed, elegant posture.",
      "question": "Is the figure presented as a stylized 3D model with a graceful seated posture?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for an earthy color palette combined with vibrant tribal patterns that are mirrored on the walls. This means the interior walls of the globe should display repeating or symmetrical patterns inspired by African tribal art, using colors like green, red, orange, and brown, consistent with the original attire's motifs.",
      "question": "Are the walls inside the globe decorated with vibrant tribal patterns in an earthy color palette?",
      "choices": [

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Tiny, detailed roots must be interwoven beneath the figure to add depth and natural texture. These roots should be visibly small in scale compared to the figure and intricately arranged to suggest organic growth within the confined space.",
      "question": "Are there tiny, detailed roots visible beneath the figure, interwoven into the ground for depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Miniature wildlife must peek from the textured ground, contributing to vitality and cultural narrative. This includes small animals such as birds, insects, or mammals, clearly scaled down to match the diorama’s size and positioned to appear hidden or emerging from the terrain.",
      "question": "Are there miniature animals visible peeking from the textured ground within the globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The cultural narrative must be conveyed through visual elements, such as symbolic patterns, traditional motifs, or environmental storytelling. This goes beyond mere decoration—it requires intentional design choices that reflect cultural heritage, possibly through clothing echoes, artifacts, or nature symbolism.",
      "question": "Are there visual elements within the diorama that convey a cultural narrative related to the figure’s origins?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The globe must have a vintage aesthetic, including signs of age such as weathered metal, cracked glass, faded maps, or ornate detailing typical of antique globes. This distinguishes it from a modern or plain sphere.",
      "question": "Does the globe exhibit vintage features such as aged materials, brass trim, or faded cartographic details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
