This implies anthropomorphic features such as facial expression, limbs, and clothing consistent with a librarian character. The presence of a face, arms, and a stern demeanor should be observable.",

      "thinking_process": "The knife must be transformed into a feather pen, which means it should no longer look like a kitchen knife but instead resemble a quill pen, likely held in the pie's hand. The shape and texture should reflect that of a writing instrument.",
      "question": "Has the knife been visually altered to resemble a feather pen, and is it being held by the pie character?",

      "question": "Is the lattice crust pattern visible on the pie character as a patterned apron, draped over its lower half?",
