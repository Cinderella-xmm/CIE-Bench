Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies enlarging the shopping bags and turning them into vibrant geometric patterns while preserving their original assorted shapes. This implies that each bag should be visibly larger than in the original image and stylized with bold, colorful geometric designs (e.g., triangles, stripes, tessellations), but still recognizable as shopping bags in form.
Question: Are the shopping bags enlarged and transformed into vibrant geometric patterns while retaining their distinct shapes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The coat must be modified to have a velvety texture and a darker crimson tone. Velvet is characterized by a soft, plush surface with visible pile and depth; "darker crimson" refers to a deeper, richer red hue compared to the original maroon.
Question: Does the coat display a velvety texture and a darker crimson color tone?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The gloves need to be changed to a sleek, glossy finish, indicating a reflective, smooth surface like patent leather or polished synthetic material, contrasting with the original matte black leather.
Question: Do the gloves exhibit a sleek, glossy finish?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The background should feature illustrated abstract retail symbols (such as price tags, shopping carts, stars, or icons) on a smooth, matte card-like surface. This means the environment around the subject should not be a real-world wall but a stylized, flat illustration with symbolic elements related to retail.
Question: Is the background composed of illustrated abstract retail symbols on a smooth, matte surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The final output must be formatted as an art postcard with an open panel for personal messages. This requires a clear visual area—typically blank or lightly textured—intended for writing, positioned either at the bottom or side of the composition.
Question: Is there an open panel designated for personal messages within the image layout?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The overall scene must remain a fashion-oriented image with enhanced colors. This includes increased saturation and contrast across the entire image, particularly in clothing, accessories, and background elements, to give a more vivid and artistic appearance.
Question: Are the colors throughout the image significantly enhanced, contributing to a vibrant and artistic fashion scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
