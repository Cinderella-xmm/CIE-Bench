Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires replacing the circular dough with a realistic atom illustration. This means the original dough should no longer be present, and instead, a scientifically accurate depiction of an atom (with nucleus and orbiting electrons) should occupy that space. The replacement must be visually distinct from the original dough and match the style of a scientific illustration.
Question: Has the circular dough been replaced with a realistic atom illustration?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that atoms should be centered as cookie designs in various colors. This implies multiple atom-shaped cookies are present, each rendered in different colors, and positioned centrally within their respective sections. The use of "cookie designs" suggests they retain a baked-good appearance but are stylized as atoms.
Question: Are there multiple atom-shaped cookie designs centered in the image, each in a different color?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Arrows must be added to label electrons, protons, and neutrons. These labels require clear directional indicators (arrows) pointing to specific parts of the atom illustration, with corresponding text identifying each particle. The presence of these elements ensures educational clarity.
Question: Are there arrows pointing to and labeling electrons, protons, and neutrons on the atom illustrations?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for a playful, whimsical font for the text. This refers specifically to the title and any other textual elements. A whimsical font would include features such as rounded letters, uneven baselines, or decorative flourishes, contrasting with standard sans-serif or serif fonts.
Question: Is the text in the image displayed using a playful, whimsical font?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction requires sectioning the illustrations neatly with dotted lines. This means the layout should be divided into distinct areas using dashed or dotted borders, separating different components of the infographic (e.g., title area, atom diagrams, labels).
Question: Are the illustrations separated by dotted lines?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The color scheme must complement the natural dough and cutter tones. This implies that while colors may be varied for the atom cookies, they should harmonize with the beige/brown hues of the original dough and white plastic cutter, avoiding jarring contrasts.
Question: Does the color scheme of the image harmonize with the natural tones of the dough and cutter (beige, brown, white)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The infographic must be titled “Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry”. This is a direct textual requirement—there must be a visible title at the top or prominent position of the image with this exact wording.
Question: Is the title “Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry” clearly displayed in the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
