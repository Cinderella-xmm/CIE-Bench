- Convert the ceiling fan into a snow globe scene.
- The exterior setting should show the snow globe resting on a tabletop under soft lighting with a warm and minimalist background.
- Light passing through the globe should create delicate shimmering effects on nearby surfaces.
- The interior of the globe should feature the fan in a playful, cartoon-style 3D design.
- The fan should be situated in a tiny room within the globe where snowflakes drift gently through the air.
