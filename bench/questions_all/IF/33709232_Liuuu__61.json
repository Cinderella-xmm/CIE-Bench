This implies replacing the original architectural form with a mechanical structure that has a sleek, white, armored appearance. The windows should be reimagined as mechanical apertures, suggesting non-organic, possibly glowing or segmented openings. The transformation must preserve the verticality and prominence of the original building but in a robotic form.",
