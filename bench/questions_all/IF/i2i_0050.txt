```
- Break down the skater's starting motion into three frames
- Show the push-off, ground contact, and forward lean phases
- Maintain a real image style 
- Include motion trajectory lines in the image
- Ensure the three images are combined cohesively
```

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states breaking down the skater's motion into three distinct frames. We need to verify if this requirement has been fulfilled.
Question: Does the edited image contain three separate frames capturing the skater's motion?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The phases of the skater's motion (push-off, ground contact, and forward lean) are critical components of the instruction. We need to ensure these specific phases are represented accurately.
Question: Are the three frames clearly showing the push-off, ground contact, and forward lean of the skater?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies maintaining a real image style, meaning the photo should retain its original realism without being overly stylized or cartoonish.
Question: Does the edited image retain the real image style without any significant stylistic distortions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Motion trajectory lines were explicitly requested in the instructions. These lines are meant to visually indicate the direction and path of the skater's movement.
Question: Are motion trajectory lines present in the edited image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The three frames should be integrated cohesively into a single image; otherwise, the edited result may appear disjointed or confusing.
Question: Are the three frames combined in a cohesive manner within the edited image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
