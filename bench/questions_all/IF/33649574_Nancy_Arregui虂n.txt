Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the rooster into a phoenix-like creature. This implies a fundamental shift in appearance from a realistic bird to a mythical, fantastical being, including changes in coloration, form, and aura. A phoenix is typically associated with fire, rebirth, and ethereal qualities, so the overall design should reflect these traits.
Question: Has the rooster been transformed into a mythical phoenix-like creature with an otherworldly appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: "Iridescent, fiery hues with shimmering gradients" refers to a dynamic, multi-colored glow resembling flames or heat waves, with colors shifting across reds, oranges, yellows, and possibly purples or blues. This effect must be visible across the feathers, not just flat coloring.
Question: Do the feathers display iridescent, fiery colors with visible shimmering gradients that simulate heat or flame effects?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The original tail of the rooster must be replaced entirely with new elements—extravagant plumes that extend outward and transition into smoke-like tendrils. This means the tail should no longer resemble natural feathers but instead have flowing, ethereal, semi-transparent trails resembling smoke or vapor.
Question: Has the rooster’s tail been replaced with long, flowing plumes that transition into wispy, smoke-like tendrils?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Molten gold accents imply metallic, glowing golden highlights that mimic liquid metal or lava, specifically placed along the wings and head crest. These should stand out as bright, reflective, and luminous against the fiery base coloration.
Question: Are there molten gold accents visibly applied along the edges of the wings and the head crest, resembling liquid metal or glowing gold?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The eyes must be modified to resemble flickering flames—this includes animated or stylized flames within the eye sockets, with dynamic light and shadow suggesting movement and heat, rather than normal avian eyes.
Question: Have the rooster's eyes been replaced or altered to look like flickering flames, with internal motion and glowing orange/yellow tones?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Ancient rune patterns on the talons suggest symbolic, etched markings resembling runic or mystical inscriptions, likely dark or glowing, positioned clearly on the feet. These runes should appear intentional and stylistically consistent with mythological or fantasy themes.
Question: Are there visible ancient rune-like patterns etched or drawn onto the rooster’s talons?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
