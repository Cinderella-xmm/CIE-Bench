      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the cookies into anthropomorphic characters with added facial features and limbs. This involves visible modifications such as eyes, mouths, and arms/legs drawn or attached to each cookie. Since the original image shows plain cookies without any facial or limb features, the edited version must clearly show these additions.",
      "question": "Are expressive faces and limbs added to the cookies to make them anthropomorphic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies three distinct emotional expressions: grinning, pouting, and winking. These are abstract emotions that must be visually represented through specific facial features—such as a wide open mouth for grinning, downturned lips for pouting, and a closed eye with raised eyebrow for winking. The edited image must contain at least one cookie with each of these expressions.",
      "question": "Does the image include at least one cookie with a grinning expression, one with a pouting expression, and one with a winking expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The setting needs to be transformed into a cozy tea party scene. This implies changes to the environment beyond just the cookies—such as adding elements like a small tea table, teacups, saucers, or other tea-related accessories. The overall atmosphere should suggest a gathering or social event involving the cookies.",
      "question": "Is there a tea party scene depicted, including props such as a tiny tea table or teacups?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The cup is meant to function as a clubhouse for the cookie characters. This means it should be stylized or reimagined to resemble a house or shelter—possibly with doors, windows, or decorative elements suggesting habitation. It should not remain a plain mug but serve as a central structure in the narrative.",
      "question": "Has the cup been modified to resemble a clubhouse, such as having windows, doors, or other architectural details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The original pink plate must be replaced with a floral-patterned picnic blanket. This change involves altering the surface texture and pattern of the plate to resemble fabric with flowers, likely spread out on the table. The shape may remain similar, but the material and design must reflect a picnic blanket.",
      "question": "Has the pink plate been replaced with a floral-patterned picnic blanket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
