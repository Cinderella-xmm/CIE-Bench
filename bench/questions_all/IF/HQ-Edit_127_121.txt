Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the spider into a mythical dream-weaver. This implies a shift from a realistic arachnid to a fantastical creature with magical or symbolic traits. The presence of wings, luminous elements, and ethereal features would confirm this transformation.
Question: Does the spider now appear as a mythical dream-weaver rather than a realistic spider?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies iridescent, woven wings that resemble a stained-glass mosaic. This means the wings should have a translucent, colorful, geometric pattern similar to stained glass, with visible lines and shifting colors.
Question: Are there iridescent wings on the spider that resemble a stained-glass mosaic in design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The abdomen must be replaced with a luminous orb that generates gentle, moving patterns. This implies a glowing sphere replacing the original abdomen, with visible dynamic light effects such as swirling or pulsing patterns.
Question: Has the spider's abdomen been replaced with a luminous orb displaying gentle, moving light patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The legs should be adorned with golden filigree spirals. This means decorative spiral patterns made of gold-like material should be visibly wrapped around or integrated into each leg segment.
Question: Do the spider's legs feature golden filigree spirals along their length?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The fangs need to be modified to resemble delicate crystal needles. This means they should no longer look like typical spider fangs but instead appear sharp, transparent, and crystalline, possibly with facets or refractive qualities.
Question: Have the spider’s fangs been transformed into delicate, transparent crystal-like needles?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: An ethereal, wispy aura must emanate from the spider’s body. This refers to a soft, glowing, translucent mist or energy field surrounding the creature, suggesting magic or otherworldliness.
Question: Is there a wispy, ethereal glow or aura emanating from the spider’s body?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
