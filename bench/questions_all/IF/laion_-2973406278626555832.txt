Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires creating a two-panel comic strip. This means the final image must be divided into two distinct panels, each serving a different purpose as described. A single image or non-divided layout would not satisfy this requirement.
Question: Is the edited image divided into two distinct panels?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: Panel 1 must feature a detailed, realistic rendering of the vape device in use. This implies the device should be clearly visible, properly proportioned, and depicted in an active state (e.g., being held or used), with high visual fidelity.
Question: Is the vape device in Panel 1 rendered in a detailed and realistic manner, showing it in use?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The text bubble in Panel 1 must contain the exact phrase “This device vaporizes liquid at low temperatures.” This is a specific textual requirement that must be present and legible.
Question: Does Panel 1 include a text bubble with the exact phrase “This device vaporizes liquid at low temperatures.”?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The background of Panel 1 must reflect a simplified laboratory setting to indicate innovation. This includes elements like lab benches, equipment, or clean, sterile aesthetics typical of a research environment, but simplified rather than highly detailed.
Question: Does Panel 1 have a background depicting a simplified laboratory setting that suggests innovation?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Panel 2 must show a cross-section diagram of the vape device with labeled internal components: coil, liquid, battery, and airflow. These labels must be clearly visible and correctly positioned relative to the corresponding parts.
Question: Does Panel 2 display a cross-section diagram of the vape device with clear labels for coil, liquid, battery, and airflow?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The text box in Panel 2 must contain the exact phrase “Understanding its internal magic!” This is a required caption to accompany the diagram.
Question: Does Panel 2 include a text box with the exact phrase “Understanding its internal magic!”?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The overall font used in both panels must be handwritten-style to give a dynamic, educational feel. This means the text should not be in standard sans-serif or serif fonts, but rather resemble hand-drawn lettering.
Question: Is all text in the comic strip rendered in a handwritten-style font?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: The vape device shown in the comic must be based on the original device from Image A. This means its shape, size, color, and design features (such as the black cap and transparent body) must be accurately preserved.
Question: Is the vape device in the comic strip visually consistent with the one shown in the original image (black cap, transparent body, etc.)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
