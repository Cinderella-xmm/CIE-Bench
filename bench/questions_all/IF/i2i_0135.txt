```
- Make the right-side skier appear to “slide out” of the image
- Create a 3D effect of coming towards the viewer from the poster
```  

```
Q1：  
Thinking process: The skier sliding out implies that part of their body should extend beyond the frame and create a visual illusion of depth.  
Question: Is part of the right-side skier’s body visibly extending beyond the right edge of the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q2:  
Thinking process: A 3D effect requires shadows, perspective changes, or visible layers to enhance dimensionality.  
Question: Does the right-side skier cast a shadow that suggests depth and closeness to the viewer?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The skier should show exaggerated motion lines or perspective distortion that enhances the sensation of sliding towards the viewer.  
Question: Are there motion lines or blurring effects around the edges of the right-side skier to simulate movement?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q4:  
Thinking process: To achieve a 3D effect, the skier’s positioning in relation to the background must change, making them appear closer to the viewer.  
Question: Has the right-side skier been repositioned to appear significantly closer to the viewer than any other objects in the scene?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The skier's body should be angled or tilted in a way that gives the impression they are coming towards the viewer rather than simply standing still.  
Question: Is the right-side skier positioned at an angle that simulates leaning forward or moving closer toward the viewer?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
