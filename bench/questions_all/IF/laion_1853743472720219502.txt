Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the feather should be redesigned as fiery, golden plumage with iridescent tips. This implies a complete change in material appearance from leather to fire-like golden feathers, with visible color gradients and shimmering effects at the tips. The original brown leather texture must no longer be present.
Question: Has the feather been transformed into golden, fiery plumage with visible iridescent tips?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The beads are explicitly instructed to be changed into glowing ember-like orbs with swirling magma patterns. This requires replacing the current turquoise stones with luminous, molten-looking spheres featuring internal flow patterns resembling lava or magma, and emitting a soft glow.
Question: Have the turquoise beads been replaced with glowing ember-like orbs that display swirling magma patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The metallic feather ornament must be replaced with phoenix claws holding a radiant, ethereal flame. This means removing the silver feather charm and introducing a new element: stylized, sharp claws made of gleaming metal, gripping a translucent, floating flame that emits light and has a mystical appearance.
Question: Has the silver feather charm been replaced with phoenix claws holding a radiant, ethereal flame?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The overall scene should convey an aura of ancient magic and rebirth. This can be observed through atmospheric effects such as subtle glows, light diffusion around the flame and beads, warm color tones (gold, orange, red), and possibly faint energy trails or particle effects suggesting magical essence.
Question: Does the edited image include visual cues such as glowing effects, warm hues, and ethereal light to create an atmosphere of ancient magic and rebirth?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The wooden backdrop must remain intact but serve as a contrasting base for the mystical elements. The wood grain and surface should still be visible, providing grounding while the foreground elements appear elevated in fantasy. The talisman's position and orientation relative to the wood should not be drastically altered.
Question: Is the wooden background still present and clearly visible, serving as a contrast to the mystical elements without being obscured or removed?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
