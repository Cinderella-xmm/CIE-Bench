Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the capybara into a Victorian-era gentleman. This involves changing its appearance from a casual, modern animal to one dressed in formal historical attire. A key indicator is whether the character now exhibits human-like posture and formal clothing consistent with the era.
Question: Is the capybara depicted in a standing upright position with human-like posture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies an "impeccably tailored suit." This implies a structured, period-appropriate garment with visible details such as lapels, buttons, and fabric texture typical of 19th-century menswear.
Question: Does the capybara wear a full suit with visible lapels, buttons, and tailoring consistent with Victorian fashion?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: A top hat is explicitly required. It must be present on the capybaraâ€™s head, shaped like a traditional 19th-century top hat (cylindrical crown, brim), made of appropriate material (e.g., felt or silk).
Question: Is there a top hat on the capybara's head that matches the style of a Victorian-era top hat?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The monocle is a distinct accessory specified in the instructions. It should be visible over one eye, typically round and mounted in a frame, indicating a refined, aristocratic look.
Question: Is there a monocle visible over one of the capybara's eyes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The original drink (a tropical cocktail) must be replaced with an ornate teacup and saucer. The teacup should have decorative elements (e.g., gold trim, floral patterns), and the saucer must be present beneath it.
Question: Has the modern cocktail glass been replaced with an ornate teacup and matching saucer?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The background must change from the Sydney Opera House scene to a 19th-century London riverscape. Key visual indicators include the River Thames, foggy atmosphere, gaslit street lamps, and architecture typical of Victorian London.
Question: Is the background now a riverscape featuring the River Thames and 19th-century London architecture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The skyline of the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben must be clearly visible in the background. These are iconic landmarks; their presence is essential for authenticity.
Question: Are the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben clearly visible in the background skyline?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for a "realistic steampunk atmosphere," which includes elements like brass gears, copper piping, steam effects, or clockwork motifs integrated into the environment or clothing. The textures should be detailed and polished.
Question: Are there visible steampunk elements such as brass fittings, gears, or mechanical details in the environment or attire?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
