Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the final image must be a digital character card in the style of an RPG collectible. This implies a structured layout resembling trading cards, with defined borders, text fields, and thematic design elements typical of such cards (e.g., border framing, stats, name display). The presence of a card-like format is essential.
Question: Is the image formatted as a digital character card with a structured layout resembling an RPG collectible?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The cat must be the central character named 'Solara the Watcher'. This requires both visual identification of the cat and textual confirmation of the name. The name must appear on the card, preferably on the nameplate at the bottom.
Question: Is the name 'Solara the Watcher' displayed on a sleek nameplate at the bottom of the card?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The art style must be semi-realistic 3D with a soft, polished finish. This means the rendering should have depth, subtle lighting, smooth textures, and a slightly stylized but lifelike appearance—distinct from flat 2D or fully cartoonish styles.
Question: Does the cat and surrounding elements exhibit a semi-realistic 3D art style with a soft, polished finish?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Stat bars must be present and clearly labeled as [Agility +9], [Curiosity +10], [Charm +8]. These are specific values and formats that must be included without variation.
Question: Are the stat bars [Agility +9], [Curiosity +10], and [Charm +8] visibly present on the card?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A golden title banner must be placed at the top of the card. This refers to a decorative element at the upper edge, likely containing a title or theme related to the character, rendered in gold color.
Question: Is there a golden-colored banner located at the top of the card?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The card must be framed with metallic trim. This means the border of the card should have a reflective, metallic appearance (e.g., silver, bronze, or gold), giving it a premium, collectible look.
Question: Is the entire card surrounded by a metallic trim border?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The background must feature a serene window scene with clear skies, matching the cat's tranquil and observant nature. This includes visible window panes, daylight, and a calm sky—consistent with the original image but integrated into the card design.
Question: Does the background include a window with clear blue skies, consistent with the original image and the described tranquil atmosphere?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
