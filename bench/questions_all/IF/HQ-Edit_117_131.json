      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The background must be transformed from a wooden fence and grass into a whimsical forest scene. This implies elements such as stylized trees, soft lighting, possibly floating leaves or magical elements, and a setting that feels fantastical rather than realistic. The current image shows a real-world backyard, so this needs full replacement.",

      "thinking_process": "Cartoonish flowers and mushrooms are required to surround the squirrel.

      "thinking_process": "A title banner with specific text and font style is required.

      "thinking_process": "The overall aesthetic must reflect a children's book character. This includes exaggerated proportions, soft edges, vibrant colors, and a cheerful tone. The squirrel should look like it belongs in an illustrated storybook, not a realistic photograph.",
