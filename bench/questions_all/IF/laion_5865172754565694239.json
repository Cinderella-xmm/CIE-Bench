The face should be expressive and \"cheeky,\" suggesting playful or mischievous features like a smirk or raised eyebrow.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The red frame must be transformed into a hero suit.

      "question": "Has the red frame been redesigned to resemble a superhero suit, including visual elements like patterns, textures, or symbols associated with a hero costume?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall style must be consistent with a lively comic page scene. This includes bold outlines, bright colors, exaggerated proportions, and a sense of action. All edits should contribute to a cohesive animated character interpretation rather than a static bike.",
