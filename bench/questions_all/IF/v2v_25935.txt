Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies recreating the entire urban street scene as a stop-motion Lego diorama. This means every element should be made out of Lego bricks.
Question: Is the entire urban street scene recreated using Lego bricks?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The cobblestone path is a specific element that needs to be reimagined using Lego bricks. This involves replacing the actual cobblestones with Lego representations.
Question: Are the cobblestones on the path represented using Lego bricks?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The buildings in the background are part of the urban scene and should also be reimagined using Lego bricks. This includes their walls, windows, and doors.
Question: Are the buildings in the background recreated using Lego bricks?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The man and his elements (clothing, bag, cap) should be reimagined using Lego bricks while maintaining the overall appearance and posture.
Question: Is the man and his clothing, bag, and cap represented using Lego bricks?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The overall composition and perspective of the original image should be maintained even after the transformation into a Lego diorama. This ensures that the spatial relationships between elements remain consistent.
Question: Does the edited image maintain the original composition and perspective of the urban street scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
