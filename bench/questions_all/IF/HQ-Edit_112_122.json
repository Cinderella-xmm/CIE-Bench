This implies simplified lines, exaggerated proportions, flat or stylized color areas, and reduced realism—typical features of cartoon art. We must verify whether the rendering shows these characteristics.",
      "question": "Is the overall visual style of the image simplified with exaggerated forms, bold outlines, and flat coloring consistent with a semi-cartoon aesthetic?",

This means that flowers in the foreground, background, and surrounding environment should appear significantly larger than natural scale, especially compared to the original image. We assess whether this scaling has been applied uniformly across key floral elements.",
