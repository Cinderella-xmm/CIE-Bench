      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the entire scene must be transformed into a miniature porcelain diorama. This implies a change in scale, material, and enclosure. A key observable feature is the presence of a transparent or ornate dome enclosing the scene, consistent with baroque styling (e.g., curved forms, decorative elements, possibly gilded accents). The scene should appear smaller and contained.",
      "question": "Is the entire church and square scene enclosed within a visible baroque-styled dome?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The church must be rendered in fine china, meaning it should have a smooth, glossy, white or off-white ceramic appearance with visible fine detailing such as painted patterns, delicate moldings, or crackle glaze effects typical of porcelain. It should no longer appear as stone or real-world architecture.",
      "question": "Is the church depicted with a glossy, white or off-white porcelain-like surface featuring intricate painted or molded details?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The people in the scene must be replaced with tiny, detailed pewter figures. Pewter has a metallic gray tone, often with subtle reflections and a matte or slightly polished finish. These figures should be significantly smaller than life-size and proportionally scaled to match the miniature diorama.",
      "question": "Are all human figures in the scene replaced with small, metallic gray pewter-like figures with detailed features?",
      "choices": [

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The diorama must rest on an antique marble base. This requires a visible platform beneath the scene made of aged-looking marble—possibly with veining, weathered edges, or classical carvings—consistent with antique design.",
      "question": "Is the entire diorama placed upon a visible base made of textured, veined, or aged-looking marble?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The street café tables must be rendered as petite and detailed, made of delicate glass. Glass would show transparency, reflections, and possibly thin legs or ornamental designs. They should be proportionally small and integrated into the miniature setting.",
      "question": "Are the café tables in the scene rendered as small, transparent, or reflective glass objects with delicate structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The trees must be crafted from delicate glass, implying they are translucent, possibly with visible internal structures or light refraction, and not solid wood. They should maintain their shape but appear fragile and luminous like stained or blown glass.",
      "question": "Are the trees in the scene made of transparent or translucent glass with visible internal details or refractive qualities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall composition must convey a vibrant and timeless nature. This can be assessed by observing whether the materials (porcelain, glass, pewter) harmonize to create a sense of elegance and permanence, and whether colors and lighting enhance the visual richness and enduring quality of the scene.",
      "question": "Does the scene exhibit a cohesive, elegant aesthetic with rich textures and balanced lighting that conveys a sense of vibrancy and timelessness?",

        "Yes",
