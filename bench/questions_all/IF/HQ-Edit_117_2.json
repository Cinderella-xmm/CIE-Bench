      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies creating \"a series of three\" postcards, which implies multiple distinct images. The original image is a single scene; therefore, the edit must produce three separate compositions. This requires verifying whether the output contains exactly three distinct postcards.",
      "question": "Does the edited version contain three separate postcards?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The first vignette must highlight pots with embossed tribal patterns. This means the pots should be visually altered to include raised or engraved tribal designs, distinct from their original appearance. The focus should be on the pots' surface texture and pattern.",
      "question": "Are the pots in the first postcard visibly modified with embossed tribal patterns?",

      "thinking_process": "The second vignette requires cartoonizing the vibrant dress with expanded motifs. This involves stylizing the dress in a cartoon-like manner—exaggerated colors, simplified shapes, and possibly enlarged or repeated patterns—while retaining its cultural design essence.",
      "question": "Is the dress in the second postcard rendered in a cartoon style with expanded or exaggerated motifs?",

      "question": "Are the bread and cucumber in the third postcard depicted as cute, character-like figures with facial features or limbs?",
