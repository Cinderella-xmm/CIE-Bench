      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies replacing the shoe upper with transparent material showing internal circuitry. This requires verifying whether the original textile upper has been replaced with a clear or semi-transparent surface that reveals visible electronic-like patterns such as circuits or microchips. The transparency should allow visibility of inner components.",
      "question": "Has the shoe upper been replaced with a transparent material that reveals intricate circuitry patterns inside?",

      "thinking_process": "The transformation must preserve the sneaker's core structure and proportions while turning it into a futuristic tech gadget. This means the shoe’s silhouette, lacing system, heel shape, and general form should remain recognizable despite material and feature changes.",
      "question": "Does the sneaker retain its original structural proportions and silhouette despite the futuristic modifications?",
