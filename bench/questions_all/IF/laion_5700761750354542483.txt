Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the jeweled butterfly into a plush toy made of soft fabrics. This implies a complete change in material from hard, reflective gemstones to soft, textile-based materials. The visual appearance should reflect fabric textures rather than metallic or crystalline surfaces.
Question: Is the butterfly now made of soft fabric instead of metallic or gemstone materials?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The gemstones in the original image are replaced with embroidered patterns. Embroidery is a textile technique involving threadwork, so the surface should show stitched designs in vibrant blues and golds rather than faceted stones.
Question: Are the decorative elements on the butterfly’s wings replaced with embroidered patterns in vibrant blue and gold colors?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states that the wings should be made of velvety material. Velvet has a distinct soft, plush surface with a slight sheen, different from shiny or rough textures.
Question: Do the wings of the butterfly appear to be made of a velvety material?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Fluffy texture along the edges suggests a soft, fuzzy trim or fringe around the wing outlines, typical of plush toys. This must be visually distinguishable from smooth or sharp edges.
Question: Are there fluffy or fuzzy textures visible along the edges of the butterfly's wings?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The butterfly shape must be preserved despite material changes. This means the overall silhouette—wing span, body proportion, and antennae—should remain consistent with the original butterfly form.
Question: Does the butterfly retain its original shape and proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The final placement requires the butterfly to rest on a plain pearl-white cushion. This means a soft, neutral-colored base must be present beneath the butterfly, contrasting with any background or surrounding elements.
Question: Is the butterfly positioned atop a plain pearl-white cushion?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
