Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the cat's body into a cloud-like spirit. This implies a complete change in physical appearance from solid feline form to ethereal, misty texture with a consistent sky-blue coloration. The original tabby pattern and solid fur must be replaced entirely.
Question: Is the cat's body now composed of a fluffy, mist-like substance with a sky-blue hue?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The knitted hat must be replaced with a natural cloud formation resembling a cumulus cluster. This means removing the blue knit cap and replacing it with a voluminous, puffy cloud structure that appears to float or swirl above the head like a crown.
Question: Has the knitted cap been replaced with a swirling cumulus cloud cluster on top of the cat's head?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Delicate cloud patterns need to be integrated into the fur. Since the body is now mist-like, this likely refers to subtle cloud textures embedded within the form, such as soft gradients, wispy edges, or streaks resembling fog or cirrus clouds.
Question: Are there visible cloud-like patterns woven into the cat’s misty body, such as soft streaks or wisps resembling fog or cirrus clouds?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Small, translucent wings must be added with faint, swirling cloud shapes. These should appear light and airy, not solid, and display internal cloud formations to match the theme.
Question: Does the cat have small, translucent wings with faint, swirling cloud patterns?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The eyes must be adorned with gentle, breezy swirls, indicating decorative cloud-like lines or motion effects around the eye area, suggesting wind or vapor.
Question: Are the cat’s eyes decorated with gentle, swirling patterns resembling breezes or vapor?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Vapor trails must follow the cat’s form, implying thin, flowing streams of mist or cloud emanating from its body, especially near limbs or tail, to suggest movement or ethereal presence.
Question: Are there visible vapor trails extending along the cat’s body, particularly from its tail or limbs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
