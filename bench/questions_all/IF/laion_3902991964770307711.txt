Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the top portions (originally candle holders) into tapered glass perfume caps. This implies replacing the metallic cup-like structures with transparent, conical glass elements that resemble high-end perfume bottle caps. The material change from metal to glass and shape change from cup-shaped to tapered must be observed.
Question: Are the three top portions of the candelabra replaced with transparent, tapered glass perfume caps?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The original metal arms connecting the candle holders must be replaced with gold-finish tubing. "Sleek, seamless" indicates smooth, uninterrupted lines without visible joints or texture, and the color should be gold rather than silver. The material transformation from reflective silver metal to polished gold tubing is essential.
Question: Have the curved arms connecting the top portions been replaced with sleek, seamless gold-finish tubing?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: A minimalist brand logo must be embossed at the base. This requires a subtle, raised design (not printed or painted) located on the bottom part of the structure. The logo should be simple in form, consistent with luxury branding, and physically integrated into the surface.
Question: Is there a minimalist brand logo embossed on the base of the object?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The surface must be overlaid with intricate floral-engraved patterns. These should be visible as fine, detailed carvings or etchings across the body of the structure, adding a classic decorative element. The engraving should not be painted but appear as part of the materialâ€™s texture.
Question: Are intricate floral-engraved patterns visible across the surface of the object?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A subtle, elegant script font label must be positioned on the central tube. This implies a text element written in cursive or flowing lettering, placed on the main vertical shaft, and designed to be understated yet legible. It should not dominate the design but complement it.
Question: Is there a subtle, elegant script font label positioned on the central tube of the object?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
