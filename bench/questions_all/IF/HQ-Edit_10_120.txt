Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies transforming the attire into a fashion-themed art postcard, which implies a shift from a realistic photograph to a stylized, artistic representation suitable for display or mailing. This requires changes in overall composition and aesthetic style to resemble a postcard format.
Question: Has the image been transformed into a postcard-style composition with a clear focus on fashion artistry?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: "Silk-like watercolor texture in pastel hues" refers to a specific visual treatment of the robe—soft blending of colors resembling watercolor painting, combined with a smooth, lustrous surface like silk. This must be observable in the fabric’s appearance.
Question: Does the robe exhibit a watercolor-like texture with soft pastel tones and a silky sheen?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly mentions "emphasizing floral patterns with gold foil accents," meaning that existing floral elements should be enhanced with metallic highlights that simulate the reflective quality of gold foil.
Question: Are there visible gold foil accents applied to the floral patterns on the robe?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A "matching floral border" implies a decorative frame surrounding the image, consistent in style and color with the robe’s floral design, reinforcing the cohesive art postcard theme.
Question: Is there a floral border surrounding the image that matches the style and colors of the robe's floral pattern?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The inclusion of a "writing space framed by delicate branches" indicates a designated blank area for text, bordered by naturalistic branch elements, typical of postcards.
Question: Is there a clearly defined writing space within the image that is framed by delicate tree branches?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies showcasing the artwork on "textured ivory paper," which means the background surface should resemble high-quality, slightly rough-textured paper in an off-white or cream tone, not a plain or glossy surface.
Question: Is the entire image displayed on a surface with a visible textured ivory paper background?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
