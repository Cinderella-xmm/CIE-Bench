      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the image into a vintage comic panel style. This involves a specific visual language including exaggerated lines, stylized elements, and a flat, illustrative appearance typical of mid-20th century comics. The presence of bold ink outlines is a defining feature of this style.",
      "question": "Are bold ink outlines visible around all major elements of the car and scene?",

      "thinking_process": "Halftone dot shading is a hallmark of vintage comic illustrations used to simulate gradients and shadows. Its absence would mean the texture requirement is not met.",
      "question": "Is halftone dot shading applied to at least one surface of the car or background to create texture?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The color palette must be restricted to muted retro tones—cream, muted orange, and deep gray. Any other colors (such as bright reds or blues) would violate this constraint.",
      "question": "Are all visible colors limited to cream, muted orange, and deep gray without any additional hues?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "A dynamic scene showing the car skidding must include motion lines, which are essential in comic art to convey speed and movement. Their absence would fail to meet the motion depiction requirement.",
      "question": "Are motion lines present around the car to indicate skidding or rapid movement?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies adding an action word such as “VROOM!” in a comic-style speech bubble. This is a required text element that must appear above the car in a stylistically appropriate format.",
      "question": "Is there a speech bubble above the car containing an action word like “VROOM!” in comic-style lettering?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The background should be simplified to emphasize the car’s motion. This means removing or abstracting details like spectators, fencing, or complex terrain, replacing them with minimalistic or stylized elements.",
      "question": "Has the background been simplified to remove detailed elements such as spectators and fencing, focusing only on motion and basic environment?",
