Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the original painting into an RPG-style digital character card. This involves adding structural elements typical of collectible cards such as borders, stats, and text elements. A "digital character card" implies a rectangular format with clear framing and UI-like components.
Question: Is the image formatted as a rectangular digital character card with defined edges and layout consistent with an RPG collectible?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the characters should be portrayed as 'The Bonded Souls,' which is a named identity for the duo. This name must appear in a designated location—specifically on a golden nameplate below the image—as per the instructions. The presence and correct placement of this element are essential.
Question: Is there a golden nameplate located below the image that displays the name 'The Bonded Souls'?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction mandates the addition of a ribbon-textured title banner above the image. This means a decorative banner with visible texture resembling fabric or ribbon, positioned at the top of the card, likely containing the title 'The Bonded Souls'.
Question: Is there a ribbon-textured banner positioned above the central image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The stat bars specified—[Empathy +10], [Protection +9], [Grace +8], [Healing +10]—must be visibly present and correctly labeled. These are functional elements common in RPG cards and must be legible and placed within the card's design.
Question: Are the following stat bars clearly visible and correctly labeled: [Empathy +10], [Protection +9], [Grace +8], [Healing +10]?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for ornate filigree framing the card. Filigree refers to delicate, intricate metalwork patterns, typically found along borders. This must surround the entire card, enhancing its collectible aesthetic.
Question: Does the card have an ornate filigree border surrounding the entire image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies a soft parchment backdrop to evoke timeless affection. Parchment implies a textured, aged paper appearance, light beige or cream in tone, serving as the background behind the main image and elements.
Question: Is the background of the card a soft, textured parchment-like surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The instruction requires preserving the gentle embrace and warm color palette from the original painting. This means the core composition—mother and child hugging—must remain intact, and colors should maintain warmth (e.g., soft reds, creams, golds) without significant shifts toward cold or harsh tones.
Question: Are the mother and child still depicted in a gentle embrace, and does the overall color scheme retain warm tones?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q8:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies using a painterly, neoclassical art style. This includes soft brushwork, classical drapery, idealized forms, and balanced composition—consistent with 18th–19th century European portraiture. The editing must not alter this stylistic quality but rather preserve it while adding new elements.
Question: Does the artwork retain a painterly, neoclassical aesthetic with soft lighting, classical clothing, and idealized figures?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
