Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the grand piano into a cookie sculpture, which implies changing its material and appearance while preserving its overall form. This includes replacing the pianoâ€™s physical structure with edible elements like icing and sugar, but maintaining its recognizable silhouette and proportions.
Question: Is the grand piano replaced with a cookie sculpture that retains the same overall shape and structure as the original piano?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies a rich caramel hue for the cookie piano, indicating a shift from the original black color to a warm, golden-brown tone typical of baked cookies. This change must be consistent across the entire surface.
Question: Is the surface of the piano sculpture uniformly colored in a rich caramel hue instead of glossy black?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for embellishment with white and gold icing, suggesting decorative patterns that mimic the ornate details of the original piano. These should be visible and artistically applied.
Question: Are there visible white and gold icing designs on the cookie piano that replicate the ornate details of the original piano?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The keys of the piano must be represented using sugar crystals, implying a textured, crystalline appearance that contrasts with the smooth icing or caramel base. This is a specific material substitution requirement.
Question: Are the piano keys made of embedded sugar crystals rather than solid black or white material?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies placing the cookie piano on a simple white marble tabletop, which serves to isolate and emphasize the sculpture. The background must not include the original concert hall setting.
Question: Is the cookie piano positioned on a plain white marble tabletop, devoid of any surrounding stage, audience, or theater elements?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
