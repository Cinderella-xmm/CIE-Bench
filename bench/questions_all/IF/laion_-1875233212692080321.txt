Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming rose petals into a luxury perfume packaging design. This implies that the original rose petals must no longer be visible and instead replaced by a new object — a perfume bottle — that is visually derived from or inspired by the roses. The transformation should be complete and not leave remnants of the original petals.
Question: Has the original rose petals been completely replaced by a perfume bottle design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies creating a tall, elegant glass bottle with petals etched around its surface. "Tall" refers to vertical proportion, "elegant" implies refined proportions and smooth lines, and "petals etched" means decorative petal patterns are engraved or carved into the glass surface, not painted or overlaid.
Question: Is there a tall, slender glass bottle present with visible etched petal designs on its surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The bottle cap must be replaced with a stylized rose shape made of glossy gold. This involves two elements: the shape (a rose) and the material finish (glossy gold). The cap should not resemble a standard screw-on lid but rather a sculpted floral form with reflective metallic properties.
Question: Has the bottle cap been replaced with a stylized rose-shaped element that has a glossy gold finish?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A deep crimson gradient inside the bottle indicates the liquid content should display a rich red tone that transitions smoothly from dark to lighter shades. This gradient must be visible through the transparent glass, suggesting depth and luxuriousness.
Question: Does the interior of the bottle show a deep crimson gradient, transitioning from dark to lighter red tones?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for a minimalist gold font logo placed vertically along the side of the bottle. This requires a text element in gold color, using simple typography (no ornate or decorative fonts), positioned vertically (top to bottom) on the bottle’s body.
Question: Is there a vertical, minimalist gold-colored text logo placed along the side of the bottle?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
