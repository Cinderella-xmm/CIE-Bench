Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires replacing the traditional attire with a Victorian-era nobleman's wardrobe. This involves changing the clothing style from Indian royal garments to Western formal wear typical of the 19th century. Key features include a tailored suit, high collar, and cravat—distinctive elements of Victorian menswear.
Question: Is the figure wearing a tailored suit with a high collar and cravat?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The turban must be replaced with a top hat ornamented with a feather. This is a clear object substitution task. A top hat is a defining accessory of Victorian nobility, and the presence of a feather adds authenticity to the period styling.
Question: Has the turban been replaced with a top hat that includes a feather?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The background must be changed to a 19th-century British countryside estate. This implies the presence of manor houses, rolling green fields, trees, and possibly stone walls or pathways typical of English rural estates during the Victorian era.
Question: Does the background depict a 19th-century British countryside estate with architectural elements such as a manor house or estate grounds?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The background must be rendered in an oil painting style using rich, muted tones. This means visible brushstrokes, soft blending of colors, absence of sharp digital edges, and a palette dominated by earthy, subdued hues like olive green, deep blue, sepia, and warm browns—typical of classical oil paintings.
Question: Is the background rendered in an oil painting style with visible brushwork and rich, muted tones?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The figure’s posture and facial expression should remain unchanged as per implicit constraints in image editing tasks—preserving identity while altering context. The original image shows a smiling figure with a white beard and closed eyes; this should be retained even after clothing and background changes.
Question: Has the figure’s facial expression and overall pose remained consistent with the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
