      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the entire scene must be transformed into a miniature diorama enclosed within a decorative glass dome. This implies the presence of a transparent, spherical or domed structure enclosing the entire scene, visible as a boundary with reflections or refractions, and possibly ornate framing or detailing on the dome itself.",
      "question": "Is the scene enclosed within a visible decorative glass dome that surrounds the entire diorama?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires \"delicate, powdery snow\" to recreate the landscape. This refers to a soft, fluffy texture of snow rather than compacted or icy snow, which should appear light and evenly distributed across surfaces like ground, trees, and structures.",
      "question": "Does the snow in the scene have a delicate, powdery texture, appearing soft and lightly settled rather than dense or icy?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction calls for \"tiny silhouetted figures with vintage attire.\" This means the people in the scene must be significantly smaller in scale relative to the Eiffel Tower and other elements, and their clothing should reflect historical fashion (e.g., long coats, hats, boots) typical of early 20th-century Parisian style.",
      "question": "Are all human figures in the scene noticeably smaller in scale and dressed in vintage-style clothing consistent with early 20th-century Parisian fashion?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies \"micro-sized streetlamps emitting a subtle glow.\" This means the lampposts must be proportionally much smaller than in reality, and they should emit a faint, warm light (not bright or harsh), suggesting illumination without overpowering the ambient lighting.",
      "question": "Are the streetlamps in the scene significantly smaller than normal scale and do they emit a soft, subtle glow?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires \"miniature bare-branched trees with a light dusting of snow.\" These trees must be small in size, lack leaves, and have only a thin layer of snow on their branches, not fully covered or heavy.",
      "question": "Are there small, leafless trees in the scene with only a light dusting of snow on their branches?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction includes \"fine cobblestone pathways weaving through the scene.\" This means visible, narrow paths made of small stones should be present, curving or intersecting through the snow-covered ground, indicating detailed ground texture beneath the snow.",
      "question": "Are there visible cobblestone pathways, partially exposed and winding through the snow-covered ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
