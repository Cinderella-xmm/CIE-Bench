This means the original elements (chalet, mountains, stream) must no longer exist as distinct natural or architectural features but must be integrated into a cohesive, creature-like form. The key is whether the image now appears as a single entity resembling a living being.",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the entire alpine scene transformed into a unified, creature-like form rather than separate landscape elements?",

      "thinking_process": "The chalet's triangular roof must be morphed into a protective shell with visible icy etchings. This implies a structural transformation where the roof’s shape remains somewhat triangular but now functions as a shell, and detailed frost-like patterns are present on its surface.",
