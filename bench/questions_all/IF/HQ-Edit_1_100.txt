Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire scene into an art calendar page. This implies visible elements typical of a calendar, such as a date or month label, border design, or layout resembling a printed calendar page. The transformation should not just be stylistic but include structural features that identify it as a calendar.
Question: Is there a visible calendar layout element (such as a date, month, or decorative border) indicating the image is formatted as an art calendar page?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The figure should be rendered in a half-cartoon style, which means a blend between realistic and stylized cartoon features. This includes exaggerated proportions, simplified facial features, or smooth outlines while retaining recognizable human form. The term "half-cartoon" suggests partial stylization, not full animation.
Question: Does the figure exhibit characteristics of a half-cartoon style, such as stylized facial features, smooth lines, or exaggerated proportions while maintaining realism in other areas?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The book must be elongated, meaning its length is visibly stretched beyond natural proportions. This is a clear geometric modification that can be observed by comparing the book's dimensions to standard proportions.
Question: Is the book in the foreground visibly longer than a normal book, with an elongated shape that exceeds typical proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The sleeves must be transformed into soft drapery, implying flowing, fabric-like folds with gentle curves and light shading to suggest softness and movement. This contrasts with the original stiff or plain sleeve appearance.
Question: Do the sleeves display soft, flowing drapery with visible folds and gentle curvature, suggesting fabric texture and movement?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The buttons must be detailed with golden filigree, meaning intricate gold patterns or ornamental designs on each button. This requires visible decorative elements that resemble fine metalwork or lace-like patterns in gold color.
Question: Are the buttons on the figureâ€™s garment decorated with visible golden filigree patterns, such as delicate engravings or ornate designs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The library shelves must be presented as a wooden frame background, meaning the bookshelves are reinterpreted or stylized to appear as part of a wooden frame surrounding the scene. This could involve framing the image with shelf-like borders or rendering the shelves as structural elements forming a frame.
Question: Are the library shelves stylized or positioned to form a wooden frame around the central figure and scene, creating a framed composition?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The scholarly atmosphere must be enhanced, which involves reinforcing elements like warm lighting, old books, academic setting, and quiet focus. This can be assessed through visual cues such as aged paper, wooden furniture, and ambient lighting.
Question: Are visual elements such as warm lighting, aged books, wooden surfaces, and focused reading posture present to enhance the scholarly atmosphere?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
