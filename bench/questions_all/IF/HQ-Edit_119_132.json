      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the husky into a life-sized plush toy. This implies that the dog must no longer appear as a real animal but as a stuffed toy. Key indicators include soft, non-realistic textures, lack of lifelike details like realistic skin or fur movement, and overall appearance consistent with a plush object.",
      "question": "Is the husky depicted as a plush toy rather than a live animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies \"exaggerated proportions,\" particularly oversized paws and an extra-fluffy tail. These are key visual cues for identifying whether the transformation into a plush toy is accurate. Oversized paws would be visibly larger relative to the body, and the tail should appear unusually thick and fluffy compared to a real husky.",
      "question": "Do the husky's paws appear significantly larger and more exaggerated than those of a real husky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly states replacing the fur texture with soft, velvety fabric. This means the surface should look smooth, matte, and textile-like, not like natural fur with individual strands and sheen. Observing the texture across the body will determine if this change was made.",
      "question": "Has the fur texture been replaced with a soft, velvety fabric appearance throughout the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Embroidered facial features are required, especially bright blue eyes. This means the eyes should appear stitched or drawn onto the fabric surface, not realistically rendered. The shape and placement should suggest embroidery, possibly with visible thread lines or uniform coloration.",
      "question": "Are the facial features, particularly the eyes, rendered as embroidered details rather than realistic ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The plush toy must be positioned on a clean wooden shelf. This involves checking the base surface—whether it is flat, light-colored wood with visible grain—and whether it appears to be a shelf structure rather than snow or ground.",
      "question": "Is the plush toy placed on a clean wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "A minimalist backdrop is required to emphasize the plush toy’s cuddly nature. This implies a simple, uncluttered background—such as plain white or neutral tones—with no distracting elements like trees, sky, or snow.",
      "question": "Is the background minimalist, without any natural elements like snow, trees, or sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
