```
-Combine the current front view with a left-side 90-degree view 
-Generate a sofa space illustration that blends both angles
```


```
Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires combining a front view with a 90-degree side view. To verify this, we must check if a left-side perspective of the sofa is visible while maintaining the front view.
Question: Does the edited image show a left-side 90-degree view of the sofa alongside the front view?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: When blending two perspectives, the continuity of features across these angles is critical. The sofaâ€™s dimensions in both views should align logically.
Question: Are the dimensions of the sofa consistent between the front and left-side views?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The transition between the two angles should appear natural and not disjointed. This ensures the seamless integration of both perspectives.
Question: Is the transition between the front and side views of the sofa smooth and coherent?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The lighting and shadows should remain consistent across the two views to ensure realism and alignment with the original single perspective.
Question: Are the lighting and shadows on the sofa consistent in both the front and side views?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Objects surrounding the sofa, such as the wall art, should appear appropriately scaled and positioned in relation to the new combined perspective.
Question: Do objects around the sofa (e.g., wall art) appear correctly scaled and positioned relative to the combined view?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
