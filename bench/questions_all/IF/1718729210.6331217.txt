Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the scarecrow into a premium Halloween decor box set. This implies that the scarecrow should no longer be standalone but part of a product package. The presence of a box-like structure around or beneath the scarecrow is necessary to satisfy this requirement.
Question: Is the scarecrow presented within a box-like packaging structure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies a "spooky nighttime farm scene" on the packaging. This means the background must depict a farm setting under night conditions, including elements like fields, distant mountains, and a dark sky with stars or moonlight. The scene should be rendered in a way consistent with Halloween aesthetics.
Question: Does the background feature a nighttime farm scene with a dark sky, stars, and a field under moonlight?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The original scarecrow is made of straw. The instruction explicitly states replacing it with glossy, weather-resistant materials. This change should be visually evident through reflective surfaces, smooth textures, or synthetic-looking fibers instead of rough, dry straw.
Question: Has the scarecrow's body been replaced with glossy, weather-resistant materials instead of natural straw?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The hat must be modified into a detachable candle holder. This means the hat should have a visible opening or cavity suitable for holding a candle, and its design should suggest it can be removed from the scarecrow’s head. Visual cues such as a hollow top or a separate base are expected.
Question: Is the scarecrow's hat designed with a visible cavity or opening suitable for holding a candle, indicating it is a detachable candle holder?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction requires adding LED string lights for accenting. These should be visibly present in the image—either wrapped around the scarecrow, draped along the packaging, or illuminating parts of the scene with soft, glowing light. Their presence should enhance the festive Halloween ambiance.
Question: Are LED string lights visibly present in the image, either on or near the scarecrow or packaging, emitting a soft glow?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A decorative crow figurine must be positioned atop the box. This means there should be a distinct, non-flying crow model placed on the upper surface of the packaging, clearly separated from any birds in flight in the background.
Question: Is there a decorative crow figurine placed on top of the box packaging?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
