Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies replacing the original navy blue uniform with a brown leather trench coat. This involves changing both the material (from fabric to leather) and color (from dark blue to brown), while preserving the silhouette and fit of the clothing. The presence of a trench coat implies a long, structured outer garment with a collar and possibly lapels.
Question: Is the officer wearing a brown leather trench coat instead of the original naval uniform?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The addition of brass gears and mechanical details is a core element of the steampunk transformation. These should be visibly integrated into the clothing—such as on the sleeves, chest, or belt—to reflect a fusion of fashion and machinery. They must be metallic and gear-shaped, not merely decorative patterns.
Question: Are brass gears and mechanical components visibly attached to the officer's clothing?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The original bell held in the hand must be replaced with a gadget-like chronometer. This device should resemble a timekeeping instrument with a mechanical or digital appearance, possibly with dials, wires, or glowing elements, consistent with steampunk technology.
Question: Is the object in the officer's right hand a chronometer-like gadget instead of a bell?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The background must transition from a beach sunset scene to a sky filled with airships and floating cities. This requires removing the ocean and sand and replacing them with aerial structures, dirigibles, and cloud-based urban environments typical of steampunk worldbuilding.
Question: Does the background depict a sky with airships and floating cities?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Goggles must be added to the tricorne hat to enhance the adventurer’s steampunk aesthetic. They should be positioned on the hat, likely resting on the brim or secured with straps, and made of metal or glass to match the mechanical theme.
Question: Are goggles visible on the tricorne hat?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The character’s posture and facial expression should remain unchanged to preserve identity and continuity. The officer should still stand upright, facing slightly to the side, with the same neutral expression and positioning of limbs.
Question: Has the officer’s posture and facial expression remained unchanged from the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The overall visual style must reflect Victorian-era steampunk, which includes brass fittings, leather, rivets, intricate mechanical parts, and an industrial yet elegant atmosphere. This style should be evident across the costume, accessories, and environment.
Question: Does the overall visual style of the image reflect Victorian-era steampunk aesthetics, including brass elements and mechanical design?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
