      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the makeup brushes should be transformed into sculpted crystal wands. This requires replacing the brush bristles and handles with crystalline structures resembling wands, which are typically elongated and smooth with a polished appearance. The transformation must fully replace the original brushes without retaining any brush-like features.",
      "question": "Are all makeup brushes replaced with sculpted crystal wands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The instruction states that each wand must be topped by a unique gemstone. This implies that there must be one distinct gemstone per wand, varying in color, shape, or cut, and positioned at the tip of each crystal wand. The uniqueness must be visually discernible.",
      "question": "Does each crystal wand have a unique gemstone at its tip?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The original glass jar must be replaced with a transparent crystal vase featuring etched floral patterns. The new vase should be made of crystal material (clear and reflective), and the floral designs must be visibly engraved or etched into the surface, not painted or applied as a sticker.",
      "question": "Is the container a transparent crystal vase with visible etched floral patterns?",
      "choices": [

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The lace band around the original jar must be transformed into a carved crystal ribbon. This means the decorative band should no longer be fabric but instead appear as a three-dimensional, intricately carved crystal structure mimicking a ribbon form, possibly with lace-like details but made of crystal.",
      "question": "Has the lace band been replaced with a carved crystal ribbon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The arrangement must be placed on a mirrored surface to enhance elegance and detail. A mirrored surface will produce a clear reflection of the objects above it, allowing visibility of the base of the vase and the wands reflected below. This is a key environmental change from the original image.",
      "question": "Is the entire arrangement placed on a mirrored surface that reflects the crystal vase and wands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
