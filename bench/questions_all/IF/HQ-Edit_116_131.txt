Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the image should be transformed into a cartoon style, which implies exaggerated proportions, simplified lines, and bold outlines typical of cartoon art. This requires assessing whether the character and clothing have been stylized accordingly, rather than remaining photorealistic.
Question: Has the womanâ€™s outfit and overall image been rendered in a cartoon style with exaggerated features and simplified lines?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: "Exaggerated floral embroidery" means the floral patterns on the outfit must be larger, more prominent, or stylistically distorted compared to the original. This involves checking if the flowers are visibly enlarged or artistically enhanced beyond realistic proportions.
Question: Are the floral patterns on the outfit significantly larger or more stylized than in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The clasp of the outfit is explicitly instructed to be styled as "intricate jade patterns." Jade is typically green or translucent, and "intricate" suggests detailed carving or ornamental design. Thus, the clasp must appear decorative and resemble jade in color and texture.
Question: Has the clasp of the outfit been redesigned to feature intricate patterns resembling jade in color and detail?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction requires vibrant colors, meaning the palette should be intensified and saturated beyond natural tones. This includes the red of the dress, the background, and any added elements being brighter or more vivid.
Question: Are the colors in the image significantly more vibrant and saturated than in the original?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Detachable writing sections imply physical or visual areas meant for text, separate from the main image, placed on a silk-like background with gold foil borders. These should be clearly visible and distinct from the rest of the artwork.
Question: Are there visible detachable writing sections with gold foil borders on a vibrant silk-like background?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
