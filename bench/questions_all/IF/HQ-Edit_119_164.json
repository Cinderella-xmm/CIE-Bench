This implies visible cosmic elements such as stars, nebulae, and swirling colors (like blues, purples, pinks) resembling deep space. The original elephant skin is solid gray, so the edit must replace it with a pattern that clearly mimics a galaxy.",

      "thinking_process": "The tusks must be replaced with a nebula-like appearance, meaning they should glow with ethereal colors (e.g., purple, blue, pink), show cloud-like textures, and appear luminous rather than solid white ivory. This transformation must be visually distinct from natural tusks.",

This means the ears should no longer resemble elephant ears but instead appear as large, sail-like structures made of translucent material with embedded stars or constellation patterns, possibly glowing faintly.",
