Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the woven texture into scales. This implies replacing the visible horizontal ridges of the original basket with a scaled pattern, possibly overlapping and textured like reptilian or fish skin, while preserving the general form of the bag.
Question: Has the woven texture of the handbag been replaced with a scaly pattern?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The gray ribbons must be reimagined as wings. This means they should take on an organic, feathered, or layered appearance suggestive of wings, possibly with curvature and spread to imply flight or elegance.
Question: Do the gray ribbons now appear as elegant wings rather than flat bows?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The white flowers are to become eyes, meaning they should be positioned to resemble eyes and have added features such as lashes or eyeliner-like details around them to create a whimsical facial expression.
Question: Have the white flowers been transformed into eye-like features with surrounding ornate lashes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A pair of delicate, sparkling antennas must be added near the handle. These should be thin, elongated structures with sparkle effects (such as glitter or light reflections) and positioned close to the top of the bag, near the handles.
Question: Are there two delicate, sparkling antenna-like structures present near the handle of the bag?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The chain attached to the bag must be modified into a serpentine tail, which implies it has been reshaped into a long, curved, snake-like form extending from the bottom of the bag and curling underneath it.
Question: Has the chain been transformed into a serpentine tail that curls gracefully beneath the bag?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The overall transformation should maintain the bag’s identity as a basket-shaped creature—meaning the base structure remains recognizable as a basket, but with added fantastical elements. The core silhouette should not be distorted beyond recognition.
Question: Does the bag retain its original basket-like shape while being transformed into a creature?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
