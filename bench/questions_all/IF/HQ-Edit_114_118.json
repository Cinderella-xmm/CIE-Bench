      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires the entire scene to be enclosed within a curved glass dome. This implies a transparent, rounded enclosure that frames the diorama, altering the perspective and adding reflections or refraction effects. The dome must be clearly visible as a structural element surrounding the ship and other components.",
      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible curved glass dome?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The sails must be rendered in papercraft style, which involves textured surfaces, sharp folds, and defined edges resembling paper layers. Shadows and highlights should emphasize the three-dimensional nature of folded paper, not fabric.",
      "question": "Are the sails depicted with visible creases, layered edges, and shadows consistent with a papercraft material?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "A layer of shimmering blue resin is required beneath the ship to simulate ocean waves. This resin should appear translucent, glossy, and possibly with internal light reflections or ripples to suggest fluidity and depth.",
      "question": "Is there a translucent, shimmering blue resin layer beneath the ship that mimics ocean waves?",

      "thinking_process": "The seagulls must be tiny and suspended on fine wires to create a sense of floating motion without appearing to fly freely. These wires should be faintly visible, suggesting artificial suspension typical in dioramas.",
      "question": "Are the seagulls suspended by fine, barely visible wires, giving them a static yet dynamic floating appearance?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The shipâ€™s details must remain intact while being transformed into a miniature diorama. This includes maintaining the structure, rigging, hull shape, and deck features, now scaled down and integrated into a display format.",
      "question": "Does the ship retain its original structural details such as masts, rigging, and hull design, now presented in miniature scale within the diorama?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The resin layer must reflect light and show wave-like patterns to emulate moving water. It should not be flat or opaque, but rather have a dynamic, luminous quality consistent with liquid simulation.",
      "question": "Does the blue resin layer exhibit shimmering surface textures and light reflections that simulate flowing water?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The curved glass dome must visually distort or frame the scene slightly, possibly showing reflections, refractions, or a rounded edge around the diorama. It should not be invisible or absent.",
