- Create a steampunk-themed diorama inside a glass bell jar
- Place the robot on a small, cog-adorned pedestal
- Surround the robot with miniature clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils
- Add tiny glowing orbs as decorative accents
- Etch intricate steampunk patterns on the jar's base
- Set the backdrop to a rusted metal texture that harmonizes with the robot's antique bronze tones

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the entire scene to be enclosed within a glass bell jar, which implies a transparent dome-like structure enclosing the robot and all surrounding elements. This is a key spatial constraint that defines the diorama setup. The presence of a visible glass boundary or dome is essential for verifying this requirement.
Question: Is the robot and its surroundings enclosed within a transparent glass bell jar?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The robot must be placed on a small pedestal that is specifically adorned with cogs. This detail is critical for maintaining the steampunk aesthetic and ensuring the robot is elevated appropriately within the diorama. The pedestal should visibly feature mechanical gear components.
Question: Is the robot standing on a small pedestal decorated with cogs?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the robot should be surrounded by miniature clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils. These objects are meant to enhance the steampunk theme and add depth to the scene. Their presence must be clearly observable around the base of the robot or within the diorama.
Question: Are there miniature clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils visible around the robot?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: Tiny glowing orbs are mentioned as decorative accents. These should be visually distinct—small, luminous, and likely emitting soft light—to serve as ambient lighting or ornamental features within the diorama. Their glow should contrast subtly with the metallic tones.
Question: Are there small glowing orbs present as decorative elements in the scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The base of the glass bell jar must have intricate steampunk patterns etched into it. This involves detailed engravings such as gears, filigree, or mechanical motifs that reflect the steampunk style. The pattern should be visible on the lower part of the jar.
Question: Are intricate steampunk-style patterns etched onto the base of the glass bell jar?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The backdrop must feature a rusted metal texture that matches the antique bronze tones of the robot. This ensures visual harmony and thematic consistency. The background should not be plain or neutral but instead display signs of corrosion, scratches, and metallic wear.
Question: Does the background display a rusted metal texture that complements the robot’s antique bronze coloration?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
