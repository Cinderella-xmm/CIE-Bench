      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the office chair into a LEGO model. This implies that the entire chair must be constructed from visible LEGO-like bricks, not just styled to look like LEGO. The structure should show modular, blocky components typical of LEGO assembly.",
      "question": "Is the chair constructed entirely from visible LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The cushions (seat and backrest) are explicitly required to be sleek black. This means both the seat and backrest surfaces must be rendered in solid black, consistent with LEGO brick coloration, and not retain any original leather texture or material appearance.",
      "question": "Are the seat and backrest cushions rendered in sleek black, resembling LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The armrests and base must be silver. This refers to metallic silver finish, consistent with LEGO’s metal-like structural elements. The material appearance should reflect this metallic tone, not chrome or other finishes.",
      "question": "Are the armrests and base of the chair rendered in silver color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The wheels are specified to be translucent gray. This requires them to appear semi-transparent with a gray tint, mimicking LEGO's translucent wheel pieces, rather than solid black or opaque.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The seat and backrest must be assembled from layered bricks with smooth gradients. This means visible horizontal layers forming the surface, with subtle shading between layers to suggest depth and smooth transitions, typical of LEGO construction.",
      "question": "Are the seat and backrest composed of visibly layered bricks with smooth gradients between them?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Armrests must be simple hinged parts. This implies minimalistic design without complex joints or padding, resembling basic LEGO hinge pieces. They should not have curved or padded designs seen in real chairs.",
      "question": "Are the armrests designed as simple hinged parts without complex padding or curves?",

      "thinking_process": "The chair must be positioned on a plain white tabletop. This means the surface beneath the chair is flat, uniformly white, and distinct from the background, emphasizing the chair’s geometry.",
      "question": "Is the chair placed on a plain white tabletop?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction emphasizes highlighting the geometric construction. This means the visual style must emphasize clean lines, modular blocks, and visible brick edges to showcase the LEGO-like nature of the build.",
      "question": "Does the image clearly highlight the geometric, modular construction of the chair through visible brick edges and clean lines?",
