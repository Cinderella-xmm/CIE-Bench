Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire figure into a Byzantine mosaic style, which involves replacing solid surfaces with small, reflective tiles (tesserae) arranged in patterns. This is a specific artistic medium with distinct visual characteristics—fragmented yet cohesive imagery, use of gold leaf, and religious symbolism. The question checks whether this core stylistic change has occurred.
Question: Has the entire figure been rendered in a mosaic style composed of small, interlocking tesserae?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The original image features metallic armor. The instruction specifies converting this into shimmering tesserae. This means the material must no longer appear as polished metal but as a surface made of many tiny, reflective pieces, typically glass or stone, with a glittering effect under light.
Question: Have the metallic components of the armor been replaced with shimmering tesserae that simulate the appearance of mosaic tiles?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies the use of intricate geometric patterns in gold and azure. These are signature colors in Byzantine art, especially in religious mosaics. The presence of these colors in complex, repeating designs is essential to meet the style requirement.
Question: Are the mosaic patterns on the figure’s armor composed of intricate geometric designs using gold and azure hues?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The wings in the original image have detailed feather structures. The instruction calls for stylizing these feathers into ornate, decorative motifs typical of Byzantine art—possibly including symmetrical, floral, or symbolic patterns rather than realistic feathers.
Question: Have the wing details been stylized into ornate feather motifs consistent with Byzantine decorative art?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The background must be transformed into a celestial dome, which implies a curved, vaulted architectural space often seen in churches and domes. It should include a radiant circular light source, symbolizing divine presence, and decorative borders reminiscent of ancient Christian iconography such as halos, crosses, or vine patterns.
Question: Has the background been changed to depict a celestial dome with a central circle of radiant light and decorative borders resembling ancient Christian iconography?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The figure must be depicted as a valiant archangel. While "valiant" is abstract, it can be interpreted through visual cues such as an upright, heroic posture, a halo, or regal attire. However, since the original figure already appears heroic, the key is ensuring the transformation does not distort the figure’s identity or dignity. The pose and facial expression should remain consistent with an archangelic representation.
Question: Does the figure maintain a heroic, dignified posture consistent with the depiction of a valiant archangel?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
