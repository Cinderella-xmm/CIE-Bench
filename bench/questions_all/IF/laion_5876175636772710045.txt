Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the man should wear a brocade doublet and tights. Brocade implies a richly patterned fabric, typically with gold or silver thread, and doublets are fitted jackets common in Renaissance fashion. Tights are also characteristic of male attire from that era. These must be visually distinct from the original modern shirt and trousers.
Question: Is the man wearing a brocade doublet and tights instead of a modern shirt and pants?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The woman's dress must be transformed into an ornate, flowing gown with visible jeweled accents. This includes intricate embroidery, gem-like embellishments, and a voluminous silhouette typical of Renaissance court gowns. The current white dress with pink trim is modern and lacks such details.
Question: Does the woman wear an ornate, flowing gown with visible jeweled accents?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The background must be replaced with a grand ballroom featuring marble floors. Marble floors are identifiable by their polished stone surface, often with veining patterns, and they should extend across the floor space beneath the dancers.
Question: Are the floor tiles made of polished marble with visible veining, consistent with a grand ballroom?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the inclusion of grand chandeliers, which are large, ornate light fixtures typical of Renaissance palaces. These should be visibly suspended from the ceiling and feature multiple candle-like lights or crystal elements.
Question: Are there large, ornate chandeliers hanging from the ceiling in the scene?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The overall style must reflect traditional Renaissance art, characterized by rich detail, balanced composition, soft lighting, and classical proportions. This includes realistic rendering of textures, use of perspective, and attention to decorative elements like architectural moldings or frescoes.
Question: Is the entire scene rendered in a detailed, painterly style consistent with traditional Renaissance art, including soft lighting and intricate textures?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The couple's pose and relative positions must remain unchanged to preserve the dance dynamic. While clothing and background change, the physical interaction—such as hand placement and body orientation—should be preserved.
Question: Have the couple’s poses and relative positions been maintained from the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
