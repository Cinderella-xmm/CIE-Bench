-Design a fresh set of chibi-style stickers featuring a wombat as the central character.
-Showcase six distinct poses: cheerfully making a double peace sign while winking playfully; displaying an adorable crying look with teary eyes and slightly quivering lips; reaching out with open arms in an inviting, heartfelt hug position; sleeping peacefully on its side, smiling softly and using a tiny pillow for support; confidently pointing forward amidst sparkling visual effects; sending a kiss with floating heart icons surrounding it.
-Follow the chibi design style: overly large, expressive eyes; gentle facial features; a fun Hawaiian shirt and straw hat inspired by the reference image; sitting posture reminiscent of the original image when applicable.
-Use bright tropical tones featuring hibiscus flowers, palm fronds, or fruity drink designs for decoration while leaving clean white space around each sticker.
-Dimension ratio: 9:16.
