      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the original single image into a two-page comic spread. This implies a clear division of content across two panels/pages, with each page having a distinct focus and layout typical of comic book formatting (e.g., separate panels, page borders, sequential storytelling).",
      "question": "Is the edited image presented as a two-page comic spread with distinct left and right panels?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly states that the swirling energy blast should be anthropomorphized into a sentient spirit with eyes and a mischievous grin. This means the energy form must have facial features—specifically eyes and a smiling expression—that are clearly visible and integrated into the energy structure.",
      "question": "Does the swirling energy blast contain visible eyes and a mischievous grin, indicating it has been anthropomorphized into a sentient spirit?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Page 1 must focus on the spirit inside the energy orb. Therefore, the primary subject of the first panel should be the anthropomorphized spirit, centered or prominently featured within the energy sphere, with no major distraction from other characters or actions.",
      "question": "Is the anthropomorphized spirit clearly the central focus of the first page (left panel)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The dialogue bubble on Page 1 must contain the exact phrase \"You've met your match, ninja! Prepare yourself!\" This is a direct textual requirement; any variation or omission would violate the instruction.",
      "question": "Does the first page include a dialogue bubble with the exact text \"You've met your match, ninja! Prepare yourself!\"?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Page 2 must depict the climax where the spirit merges with the opposing force. This requires a visual representation of convergence or fusion—such as overlapping energy forms, directional motion toward unity, or combined shapes—between the spirit and the opposing entity (e.g., Naruto’s chakra or attack).",
      "question": "Does the second page (right panel) show a visual depiction of the spirit merging with the opposing force, such as overlapping energy forms or a unified strike?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The action bubble on Page 2 must contain the exact phrase \"Ultimate fusion strike!\" This is a specific textual element required for narrative clarity and alignment with the described climax.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The background of Page 2 must convey chaos through swirling debris and elemental fragments. This implies visual elements like broken rock pieces, glowing particles, or shattered energy remnants in dynamic motion around the central action.",
      "question": "Does the background of the second page feature swirling debris and elemental fragments to represent chaos?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
