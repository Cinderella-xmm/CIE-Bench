Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the individual into a plush doll. This involves changing the human figure into a soft, stuffed toy-like appearance, which includes altering the skin texture to appear fabric-like and adding characteristics typical of plush toys such as rounded edges and a non-realistic form.
Question: Has the individual been transformed into a plush doll with a soft, stuffed appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies wild, fluffy white hair that should be emphasized as soft and tactile. This means the hair must appear voluminous, textured like fur or stuffing, and not realistic human hair.
Question: Does the doll have wild, fluffy white hair that appears soft and tactile, resembling plush material?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The sweater must be miniaturized and styled to look cute, with visible black stitching details. This implies the sweater should be proportionally smaller than normal clothing and feature hand-stitched textures rather than smooth knit.
Question: Is the doll wearing a miniaturized, cute sweater with visible black stitching details?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for exaggerated proportions—specifically a large head and a rotund body. This means the head should dominate the figure’s size, and the body should be round and bulky, consistent with stylized plush dolls.
Question: Does the doll have an exaggeratedly large head and a rotund, rounded body?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The sweater must retain the distinct vertical black stripes, but these must be rendered as soft stitched patterns, indicating they are part of the textile design and not painted or printed elements.
Question: Are the vertical black stripes on the sweater depicted as soft stitched patterns, maintaining their original orientation and visibility?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: While the figure is transformed into a plush doll, key facial features such as the mustache and eyes should remain recognizable but stylized in a way appropriate for a plush toy (e.g., embroidered or simplified).
Question: Are the facial features, including the mustache and eyes, preserved in a stylized form consistent with a plush doll?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
