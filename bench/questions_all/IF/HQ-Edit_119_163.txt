Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the teapot into a luxury tea brand packaging. This implies changing the overall form from a traditional teapot to a modern, functional tea canister. The core change is the shape transformation, which must be clearly visible and aligned with typical packaging design—specifically, a cylindrical form suitable for storage.
Question: Has the body of the teapot been transformed into a sleek cylindrical shape?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The dragon engravings are explicitly required to be maintained. Since they are a defining feature of the original object, their presence and stylistic fidelity must be preserved even after reshaping the body. This includes ensuring that the dragons remain detailed, three-dimensional, and integrated into the new surface.
Question: Are the dragon engravings still present and visibly detailed on the body of the canister?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The original lid must be replaced with a streamlined metallic screw cap. A screw cap is identifiable by its threaded edge and flat or slightly domed top. It should not resemble a hinged lid but instead suggest a twist-off mechanism typical of premium packaging.
Question: Has the original hinged lid been replaced with a metallic screw cap?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies embossing intricate tea leaves around the screw cap. This means decorative relief patterns of tea leaves must be visible on the outer surface of the cap, near its base or perimeter, contributing to the luxurious and thematic design.
Question: Are intricate tea leaf patterns embossed around the circumference of the screw cap?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The brand name "Dragon's Delight" must be inscribed along the spout. This requires legible text placed in a linear fashion along the length of the spout, possibly engraved or etched into the metal, matching the font and style expected in luxury branding.
Question: Is the text "Dragon's Delight" visibly inscribed along the length of the spout?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: A minimalist tea leaf logo must be added to the top of the cap. This refers to a simple, stylized representation of a tea leaf, likely centered on the cap’s flat surface, designed with clean lines and no excess detail to reflect minimalism.
Question: Is there a minimalist tea leaf logo located on the top center of the screw cap?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
