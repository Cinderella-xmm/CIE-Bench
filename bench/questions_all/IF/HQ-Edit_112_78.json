      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the teapot into a candle holder. This implies that the object's function and form must be redefined from a teapot to a candle holder, which involves structural changes such as removing the spout and handle if they are not part of the new design, and introducing features like a wick or candle receptacle. The core visual identity should now reflect a candle holder rather than a teapot.",
      "question": "Has the teapot been transformed into a candle holder with a visible candle or wick structure?",

      "thinking_process": "The lid must be modified into a finial-style candle snuffer. This implies the top part should resemble a decorative finial (a stylized cap or ornament) and include a functional element like a metal snuffer tip used to extinguish candles. It should no longer resemble a traditional teapot lid.",
      "question": "Has the lid been redesigned into a decorative finial-style candle snuffer with a snuffing mechanism?",

      "thinking_process": "The original lace tablecloth must be replaced with a sleek marble base that has a reflective surface. This means the fabric must be removed entirely and replaced with a solid, polished stone-like material that reflects light, possibly showing subtle veining typical of marble.",
      "question": "Has the tablecloth been replaced with a sleek, reflective marble base?",
