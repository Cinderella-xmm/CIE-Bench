Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the spiral staircase into a serpent form. This involves replacing the entire structure of the stairs with a serpentine shape while maintaining the spatial flow and curvature of the original staircase. The transformation must be complete—no part of the original stair should remain visible.
Question: Has the spiral staircase been fully replaced by a serpent-shaped form that follows the same helical path?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the serpent should have intricate lattice-like scales. These are not just simple textures but structured, repeating geometric or interwoven patterns resembling a lattice, which must cover the body of the serpent.
Question: Does the serpent’s body feature detailed lattice-like scales across its surface?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The steps of the original staircase must be mimicked by the extended body of the serpent. This implies that the segmented, descending nature of the stairs should now be represented by the coiled or segmented segments of the serpent’s body, maintaining the downward progression.
Question: Is the serpent’s body extended downward in a way that visually replicates the step-like descent of the original staircase?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The original railing has ornate filigree details. The instruction requires that similar decorative patterns be added to the serpent’s body, suggesting a visual continuity between the old railing and the new design elements on the serpent.
Question: Are ornate, filigree-like patterns present on the serpent’s body, matching the style of the original railing?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The banister must be replaced entirely with delicate, translucent fins. This means no solid handrail should remain; instead, a series of thin, possibly semi-transparent, fin-like structures should extend along the serpent’s side, following its curve.
Question: Has the banister been replaced with a series of delicate, translucent fins along the serpent’s side?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The serpent’s head must be embedded at the top of the spiral, where the original staircase ends. It must include glowing gem-like eyes, indicating luminous points that stand out from the rest of the design, likely emitting light or having a reflective quality.
Question: Is there a serpent’s head positioned at the uppermost point of the spiral, featuring two distinct luminescent gem-like eyes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: The material of the original stairs appears to be marble or stone. The instruction requires embedding a marble-like texture onto the serpent’s body to maintain visual consistency with the original materials. This includes veining, subtle shading, and a smooth, polished appearance.
Question: Does the serpent’s body display a marble-like texture with visible veining and polished surface characteristics?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
