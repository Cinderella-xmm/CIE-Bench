Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly requires replacing the wooden surface with a marble texture. This involves changing the material and visual properties of the surface beneath the teapot, from wood grain and wear to smooth, veined marble. The presence of characteristic marble patterns (e.g., veins, polished finish) must be observed.
Question: Has the wooden surface been replaced with an elegant marble texture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies overlaying a transparent label on the pot that includes flavor text such as "Earl Grey Elegance." This requires detecting a semi-transparent layer with readable text positioned on the teapot’s body or side, consistent with labeling in packaging design.
Question: Is there a transparent label overlaid on the teapot with visible text including "Earl Grey Elegance"?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: A finely embossed gold monogram logo must be present on the lid. This implies a metallic, raised design in gold color, likely stylized initials or emblematic form, located specifically on the lid’s top surface.
Question: Is there a finely embossed gold monogram logo visible on the lid of the teapot?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The instruction requires creating a box with similar engravings to the teapot. This means a separate container (box) should appear in the scene, featuring engraved decorative patterns matching the style of the teapot’s ornamentation.
Question: Is there a box present in the image with engravings similar in style to those on the teapot?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The overall transformation into a luxury tea brand packaging design implies that all elements—teapot, label, box, surface, and logo—must align with a cohesive high-end aesthetic. This includes refined materials, elegant typography, and harmonious composition typical of luxury branding.
Question: Does the overall composition reflect a luxury tea brand packaging design with cohesive branding elements such as elegant textures, consistent engravings, and premium presentation?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
