Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the tiger figure into a paper-cut style, which implies flat, silhouette-like shapes with clean edges and no shading or depth. This style is typically characterized by sharp outlines and visible layering effects, similar to traditional Chinese paper cutting.
Question: Is the tiger figure rendered in a flat, cut-paper style with defined edges and no realistic shading?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: "Exaggerated stripes" implies that the natural pattern of the tiger’s fur has been stylized and widened beyond realism to enhance visual impact and achieve a playful tone. This should be clearly visible on the face and body.
Question: Are the tiger's stripes visibly wider and more stylized than natural tiger markings?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: "Enlarged whiskers" means the whiskers are longer and thicker than typical, contributing to a cartoonish or whimsical appearance. They should stand out due to size and prominence.
Question: Are the tiger's whiskers noticeably longer and thicker than natural proportions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The floral kimono must be designed as layered paper panels, suggesting visible separation between layers, possibly with slight offsets or shadows indicating depth, mimicking actual folded paper.
Question: Does the kimono appear as if composed of multiple overlapping paper layers with distinct edges?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: Gold foil cherry blossoms imply metallic sheen and reflective highlights on the floral patterns, particularly on the kimono. These should be visually distinct from regular printed flowers.
Question: Are there shiny, metallic gold accents on the cherry blossom patterns of the kimono?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: Detachable panels suggest physical separability—either through perforations, tabs, or fold lines—indicating that parts of the image can be removed or unfolded independently.
Question: Are there visible perforations, tabs, or fold lines indicating detachable sections of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: Interactive folding elements mean the design includes creases, flaps, or hinges that allow movement when manipulated, such as pop-up or accordion folds.
Question: Are there visible fold lines or structural elements suggesting the image can be physically folded or interacted with?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
