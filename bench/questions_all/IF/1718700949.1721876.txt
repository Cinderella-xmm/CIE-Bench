Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the elephant must be transformed into a "majestic miniature" and placed inside a "glass display case." This implies a reduction in scale and the presence of transparent enclosure boundaries. The key observable features are the size reduction relative to the original and the visible glass casing with reflections or transparency.
Question: Is the elephant depicted as a smaller-scale version enclosed within a transparent glass display case?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The armor on the elephant must be made of "metallic resin," which suggests a reflective, possibly textured material with a synthetic sheen, distinct from fabric or plain metal. The visual cue would be a shiny, slightly industrial or polished appearance consistent with resin casting.
Question: Are the intricate armor details on the elephant rendered with a shiny, metallic-resin-like texture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction requires "miniature silk-gold banners" placed at the "case corners." These should be small decorative elements, golden in color, resembling silk fabric, positioned at each corner of the glass case.
Question: Are there four small golden banners made of silk-like material positioned at each corner of the glass display case?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: A "backdrop of layered, translucent mountain silhouettes" indicates that the background mountains should appear faded, semi-transparent, and arranged in depth layers to create a mystical atmosphere. They should not be solid or opaque.
Question: Does the background feature multiple layers of mountains with translucent, soft-edged silhouettes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for "small bonsai-like trees" at the "foreground edges." These should resemble stylized, miniature trees with carefully pruned forms typical of bonsai art, located along the front edges of the scene.
Question: Are there small, stylized bonsai-like trees placed along the foreground edges of the display?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
