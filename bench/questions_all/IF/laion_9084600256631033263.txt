Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the entire car into a whiskey decanter. This means the overall form and structure must resemble a bottle, not just a modified car. The transformation should maintain recognizable curvature from the original car but reinterpreted as a glass bottle shape.
Question: Has the body of the car been transformed into a sleek, silver glass bottle that reflects the original car's curves?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The headlights are explicitly instructed to be replaced with faceted glass stoppers. This implies they should no longer resemble automotive lights but instead look like crystal or gem-like stoppers commonly seen on premium bottles.
Question: Have the original headlights been replaced with faceted glass stoppers?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: A chrome-finish, gear-shaped lid is specified. This means the top of the decanter must feature a mechanical-looking, gear-shaped cap made of chrome material, replacing the convertible top or roof.
Question: Is there a chrome-finish, gear-shaped lid on top of the decanter?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The model’s emblem (Datsun 1600) must be embossed on the front. This implies a raised, three-dimensional logo or text integrated into the surface of the glass bottle, maintaining brand identity in a tactile way.
Question: Is the Datsun 1600 emblem embossed on the front of the decanter?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The design must incorporate both vintage style (e.g., retro fonts, classic shapes) and modern branding elements (e.g., clean lines, minimalist typography). This suggests a blend of old-world craftsmanship with contemporary aesthetics.
Question: Does the decanter design combine vintage styling (such as classic curves or script) with modern branding elements (such as clean lines or minimalist text)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
