      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies converting the original diagram into a whimsical comic illustration. This requires transforming the formal layout into a cartoonish, storybook-style scene with characters and narrative elements. The presence of anthropomorphic animals and comic elements like speech bubbles and expressive features indicates a shift from a technical diagram to a playful narrative format.",
      "question": "Is the image now a whimsical comic illustration rather than a formal diagram?",

      "thinking_process": "The central data element must be transformed from a database icon into a visually engaging, fantastical object—specifically, a glowing loot of data crystals. This symbolizes data in a magical, storybook context and must be centrally located and shared among characters.",
      "question": "Is the central \"Data\" element replaced with a glowing pile of data crystals, surrounded and guarded by all characters?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Humor through speech bubbles is required to clarify each character’s role in an entertaining way. For example, the squirrel should have a line like “I dig data acorns!” which reflects both its action and the metaphorical meaning of data preparation.",
      "question": "Does each character have a speech bubble with a humorous line describing their role in the data journey?",
