      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies transforming the Tai Chi practitioners into Song Dynasty poets in elegant robes. This implies a change in clothing style—replacing modern attire with traditional Chinese robes such as hanfu, with flowing sleeves and refined silhouettes. The transformation must be visually consistent across all three figures.",
      "question": "Are all three figures wearing elegant, flowing robes characteristic of Song Dynasty attire?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The gesture requirement is explicitly tied to calligraphy inspiration—meaning movements should resemble brushstrokes, with elongated limbs, deliberate curves, and dynamic flow. These gestures must appear intentional and stylized rather than naturalistic.",
      "question": "Do the figures' arm and hand positions reflect flowing, calligraphy-inspired movements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Willow trees in classical Chinese ink paintings are often rendered with expressive, thin brushstrokes that suggest draping branches and foliage without full detail. The instruction requires these trees to be transformed into brushstroke-rendered elements, meaning their forms should not look photorealistic but instead emulate ink lines.",
      "question": "Are the willow trees depicted using visible brushstroke-like lines rather than realistic textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Lotuses in the scene must also follow the ink painting style—this means their petals and leaves should have defined outlines resembling brushwork, possibly with ink bleed effects or simplified shapes, avoiding photographic realism.",
      "question": "Are the lotus flowers and leaves rendered with brushstroke-style outlines and textures, consistent with ink painting techniques?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Distant mountains in classical ink paintings are typically rendered as soft, hazy forms using layered ink washes, creating depth through tonal variation and fading edges. The instruction calls for misty ink washes, so the mountains must lack sharp definition and blend into the background.",
      "question": "Are the distant mountains depicted as soft, misty forms with gradient ink washes rather than clear, detailed peaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall atmosphere must reflect serenity and contemplation, which in ink painting is achieved through minimalism, balanced composition, muted colors, and use of negative space. The absence of bright colors or dynamic lighting contributes to this mood.",
      "question": "Is the color palette dominated by muted tones of black, gray, white, and subtle earth tones, with minimal saturated colors, contributing to a tranquil atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "All figures must be stylistically unified under the ink painting aesthetic—this includes line quality, texture, and proportion. Any figure retaining photorealistic features would violate the instruction.",
      "question": "Are all three figures fully integrated into the ink painting style, without any photorealistic textures or details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
