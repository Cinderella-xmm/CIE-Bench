Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the image into a baroque sculpture style. Baroque sculptures are characterized by dramatic expression, dynamic movement, rich ornamentation, and a sense of grandeur. The subject must be portrayed as a powerful deity, implying elevated posture, divine attributes, or regal presence. This can be assessed by observing whether the figure exhibits exaggerated musculature, theatrical pose, and symbolic elements typical of divine representation in baroque art.
Question: Is the subject depicted in a manner consistent with a powerful deity, including divine posture, expressive features, or symbolic elements typical of baroque religious sculpture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies enhancing the hair texture into intricately detailed marble curls. Marble hair in sculpture is typically rendered with smooth, flowing forms, defined edges, and realistic curl patterns that reflect light like stone. This requires checking if the hair has been transformed from its original appearance into a sculpted, textured form resembling carved marble.
Question: Has the hair been transformed into intricately detailed, sculpted marble curls with visible texture and form consistent with carved stone?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction calls for ornate ornamental carvings on the neck and shoulders. These should resemble high-relief decorative elements found in baroque sculpture—such as scrolls, floral motifs, or symbolic emblems—carved into stone. The ornaments must appear three-dimensional and integrated into the figure’s anatomy as part of the sculpture.
Question: Are there ornate, sculpted carvings present on the neck and shoulders, resembling baroque-style relief decorations made of stone?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The background must be modified into an elaborate bas-relief featuring angelic figures. Bas-relief involves shallow carving with depth, often depicting scenes with multiple figures. "Angelic figures" implies winged beings in classical or religious poses. The background should no longer resemble the original setting but instead show carved, layered imagery typical of baroque altarpieces or temple reliefs.
Question: Does the background feature an elaborate bas-relief with clearly defined angelic figures, such as winged beings in dynamic poses, carved in low relief?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The instruction requires a monochrome palette to mimic polished white marble. Polished marble appears predominantly white or off-white with subtle gray veining, and reflects light smoothly. The entire image—including skin, clothing, accessories, and background—should lack color variation beyond grayscale tones, with highlights and shadows suggesting stone-like surface qualities.
Question: Is the entire image rendered in a monochrome palette, simulating the appearance of polished white marble, with no visible color except variations in gray tone?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
