      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the human figure into a wise owl character. This involves changing facial features, body shape, and adding owl-specific traits such as feathers, beak, and eyes. The transformation must be complete and recognizable as an owl, not just partially altered.",
      "question": "Has the speaking figure been fully transformed into a wise owl character with distinct owl features such as a beak, feathers, and large eyes?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The original blue attire must be retained but adapted to resemble a feathered cloak. This means the clothing should still appear blue but have a textured, feathery appearance consistent with an owl's plumage while maintaining the general shape and color scheme.",
      "question": "Is the blue attire replaced with a feathered cloak that retains the original blue color but has a textured, feather-like surface?",

      "question": "Are small glasses visibly present and securely placed on the owl’s beak?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The hand gestures of the original figure must be reinterpreted as expressive wing movements. This implies that the hands are no longer visible as human limbs but have been transformed into wings in motion, conveying similar expressiveness.",
      "question": "Have the hand gestures been replaced with expressive wing movements that mimic the original gesture's meaning?",
