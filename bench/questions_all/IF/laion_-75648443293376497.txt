Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires replacing the original canvas-like fabric with a rugged leather texture. This involves changing the material appearance to show grain, creases, and a more durable, aged look typical of leather, rather than the smooth, woven texture of canvas.
Question: Has the backpack's fabric been replaced with a visible rugged leather texture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The buckles are specified to have an antique brass finish, which implies a golden-yellow tone with patina or tarnish effects to simulate age and use. This is distinct from the original silver-colored metal hardware.
Question: Have the buckles been updated to feature an antique brass finish instead of the original metallic silver color?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: Vintage travel patches are explicitly mentioned to be added along the sides. These should resemble worn, stitched-on badges or labels commonly found on travel gear, possibly featuring maps, flags, or destination names.
Question: Are there visible vintage-style travel patches attached along the side panels of the backpack?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The text "EXPLORE VINTAGE" must be overlaid on the front flap in a readable, stylized font that matches the vintage aesthetic—possibly serif, slightly distressed, or hand-lettered—and positioned centrally or prominently.
Question: Is the text "EXPLORE VINTAGE" clearly visible and overlaid on the front flap of the backpack?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: A sketch-style compass graphic must be subtly embossed near the base. This means it should not be fully colored or prominent but rather lightly etched or textured into the surface, resembling a hand-drawn compass rose with faint lines and markings.
Question: Is there a subtle sketch-style compass graphic embossed near the bottom of the backpack?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
