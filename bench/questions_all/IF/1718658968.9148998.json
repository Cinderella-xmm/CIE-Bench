      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires replacing the stone texture with wooden puzzle pieces. This involves changing the surface material from stone to wood, specifically using natural oak and mahogany tones. The visual cue for success is the presence of visible wood grain, color variation between oak and mahogany, and a segmented appearance resembling puzzle pieces.",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the castle composed of visible wooden puzzle pieces with natural oak and mahogany coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The architectural form must be preserved, meaning the number of towers, windows, archway, and wall structure should remain identical in shape and layout to the original image. This ensures that only the material has changed, not the design.",
      "question": "Does the castle retain its original architectural structure, including two towers, arched entrance, multiple windows, and connecting walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the tower tops must have intricate interlocking details, which implies visible mechanical or geometric joints typical of puzzle construction. These details should be clearly observable at the crown of each tower.",
      "question": "Do the tops of both towers display detailed interlocking puzzle piece patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The scene must be repositioned onto a smooth wooden tabletop. This means the base of the castle should rest on a flat, polished wooden surface that contrasts with the previous natural ground and water setting. The background should no longer include sky, trees, or water.",
      "question": "Is the castle placed on a smooth, flat wooden tabletop that serves as the new base of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The transformation into a puzzle structure implies that individual wooden pieces should be discernible, fitting together with visible seams and edges. This creates a sense of modularity and craftsmanship, essential to the \"puzzle\" concept.",
      "question": "Are the wooden components of the castle visibly segmented into individual puzzle-like pieces with defined edges and joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The original image includes a body of water reflecting the castle. Since the scene is now on a wooden tabletop, this reflective water must be removed or replaced with a solid surface. The absence of water and reflection is necessary to maintain consistency with the new setting.",
      "question": "Is the reflective water in front of the castle absent or replaced by the wooden tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
