      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the butterfly into a whimsical floral creature. This implies a complete metamorphosis of its form, not just superficial changes. The core identity must shift from insect to plant-like being, which can be assessed by observing whether the overall shape and structure align with botanical features rather than insect anatomy.",
      "question": "Has the butterfly been transformed into a creature that visually resembles a floral being, with no recognizable insectoid body parts?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The wings must fold into petal forms, indicating a structural change where rigid wing membranes are replaced by soft, curved, overlapping petal shapes. This is an observable transformation in silhouette and texture.",
      "question": "Do the wings appear folded into distinct, vibrant petal-like structures instead of flat, membranous insect wings?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The body must resemble a delicate flower stalk, meaning it should have a slender, elongated, vertical form typical of plant stems, possibly with subtle textures like nodes or ridges, replacing the segmented insect thorax and abdomen.",
      "question": "Does the butterfly's body now resemble a thin, upright flower stalk rather than an insectâ€™s segmented torso?",

      "thinking_process": "Wing patterns must be replaced with intricate leaf designs, implying that the original orange and black veins are substituted with detailed leaf venation, serrated edges, or organic green motifs. This is a visual replacement task.",
      "question": "Are the original wing patterns replaced with detailed, naturalistic leaf designs across the entire surface of the wings?",

      "thinking_process": "Small blossoms must be integrated at the wing edges and foot. This means tiny flowers should be present along the outer margins of the wings and at the base (foot) of the creature, adding floral detail to key points.",
