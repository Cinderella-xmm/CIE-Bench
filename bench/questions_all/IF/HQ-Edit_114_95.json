      "thinking_process": "The instruction requires transforming the Eiffel Tower into a perfume bottle. This implies that the entire structure must be reimagined as a bottle shape—specifically, a tall, slender container with a defined neck and base—while retaining recognizable elements of the original tower’s form in its design. A \"yes\" answer would confirm that the iconic tower has been replaced by a bottle-shaped object.",
      "question": "Has the Eiffel Tower been replaced with a bottle-shaped object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies a \"sleek glass silhouette\" with \"delicately embossed patterns resembling the tower's lattice.\" This means the surface should appear transparent or translucent like glass, and the intricate ironwork of the original tower must be translated into raised or etched designs on the glass surface. The material and texture must reflect both clarity and fine detail.",
      "question": "Does the structure have a transparent or glass-like appearance with embossed lattice patterns resembling the Eiffel Tower's framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "A \"gold-plated base\" is explicitly mentioned as the foundation of the bottle. This indicates a metallic, reflective golden element at the bottom of the bottle, serving as its support. It must be visually distinct from the glass body and positioned at the lowest point.",
      "question": "Is there a gold-colored, metallic-looking base supporting the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction asks for a \"subtle Parisian skyline motif along the glass.\" This implies a faint, integrated design of Parisian buildings (such as rooftops, spires, or landmarks) embedded within or etched onto the glass surface, not as a separate image but as part of the bottle's decoration.",
      "question": "Is there a faint depiction of a Parisian skyline visible on the surface of the glass bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "A \"modern, minimalist logo\" is required at the bottle's neck. This means a clean, simple, possibly abstract or typographic mark placed near the top of the bottle, just below the cap or opening. It should not be ornate or cluttered, and it should be clearly distinguishable from the rest of the design.",
      "question": "Is there a small, simple, and modern logo located at the neck of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
