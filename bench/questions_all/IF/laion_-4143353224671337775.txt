Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires transforming the original ceramic form into a puzzle piece sculpture. This means the entire structure must be composed of visible, interlocking puzzle pieces rather than a solid ceramic form. The transformation must be complete and not just partial.
Question: Is the entire ceramic form now constructed from interlocking puzzle pieces?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies using beige and brown puzzle pieces. These colors must be present and dominant in the sculpture. Any other color scheme would violate this requirement.
Question: Are the puzzle pieces primarily beige and brown in color?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction emphasizes creating a smooth, continuous shape by aligning the puzzle edges. This implies that the edges of the puzzle pieces should fit together seamlessly without gaps or misalignment, forming a cohesive surface.
Question: Are the puzzle piece edges aligned smoothly to create a continuous surface without visible gaps?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The conical top of the original object must be replaced with a smooth green-colored puzzle fragment. This involves both a change in shape (from conical to flat/smooth) and color (to green), while maintaining the puzzle piece style.
Question: Has the conical top been replaced with a smooth green puzzle fragment?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The final placement of the artwork must be horizontal on a plain white shelf. This includes both orientation (horizontal) and background (plain white shelf), which indicates a specific display context for a contemporary look.
Question: Is the sculpture positioned horizontally on a plain white shelf?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
