- Create a glass dome display showcasing the eagle as a 3D stylized sculpture in mid-flight
- Include swirling miniature clouds under its wings
- Accent the miniature clouds with gold leaf for elegance
- The display base should be crafted from polished dark wood
- The base should be engraved with the phrase "Noble Sky Guardian"
- Add small brass compass roses around the dome for a hint of adventure

Q1:
Thinking process: The instruction requires the eagle to be presented as a 3D stylized sculpture inside a glass dome. This implies that the eagle must no longer appear as a natural bird in flight against the sky, but instead be enclosed within a transparent spherical structure, rendered with sculptural detail and depth. The presence of a visible glass dome is essential to fulfill this requirement.
Question: Is the eagle enclosed within a transparent glass dome?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q2:
Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the eagle should be a 3D stylized sculpture. This means the eagle must have a modeled, three-dimensional appearance, possibly with exaggerated or artistic proportions, rather than being a photorealistic depiction. The rendering style should reflect sculptural qualities such as defined edges, lighting highlights, and material texture consistent with a statue.
Question: Does the eagle appear as a 3D stylized sculpture with sculptural features (e.g., defined form, modeling lines, or material texture)?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q3:
Thinking process: The instruction requires swirling miniature clouds positioned under the eagle’s wings. These clouds must be smaller in scale than the surrounding sky clouds and arranged in a dynamic, swirling pattern beneath the wings to suggest motion and elevation within the display.
Question: Are there miniature swirling clouds located directly under the eagle's wings?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q4:
Thinking process: The miniature clouds are to be accented with gold leaf, which implies visible golden highlights or decorative elements applied to the cloud surfaces. This adds an elegant, luxurious touch and must be distinguishable from natural cloud coloration.
Question: Are the miniature clouds under the eagle’s wings decorated with visible gold leaf accents?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q5:
Thinking process: The display base must be made of polished dark wood, indicating a smooth, reflective surface with a deep brown or black tone typical of fine hardwoods. It must support the glass dome and serve as a foundation for the entire display.
Question: Is the base of the display made of polished dark wood?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q6:
Thinking process: The base must be engraved with the specific phrase "Noble Sky Guardian". This text must be legible and clearly visible on the wooden surface, likely in a refined font suitable for engraving.
Question: Is the phrase "Noble Sky Guardian" visibly engraved on the base of the display?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Q7:
Thinking process: Small brass compass roses must be added around the dome. These are symbolic navigational elements, typically circular with directional markings, and should be metallic in appearance, matching brass in color and finish.
Question: Are there small brass compass roses placed around the base or exterior of the glass dome?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
