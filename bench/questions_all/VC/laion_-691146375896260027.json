      "thinking_process": "The bombe silhouette is the defining shape of this commode, distinguishing it from other chest styles. Its outward curve at the center and inward tapering toward the ends is a hallmark of Rococo design. If lost in the LEGO version, the object would lose its identity. This is a core recognition feature, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the overall bombe (curved, outward-bulging) silhouette of the commode preserved in the LEGO version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The two vertically stacked drawers are central to the function and visual rhythm of the piece. Their presence and alignment define the structure. Removing or merging them would alter the objectâ€™s fundamental design. This is an important structural and functional element, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Are there exactly two drawers stacked vertically on the front of the dresser, each framed by brass mounts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The geometric marquetry pattern (herringbone and starburst) is a signature decorative feature, unique to this piece. It identifies the craftsmanship and origin. Replacing it with random LEGO patterns would destroy the visual identity. This is a core decorative element, critical for recognition, hence 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the herringbone and starburst marquetry pattern visible on the front of both drawers in the LEGO version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The brass mounts with acanthus leaf scrolls are iconic Rococo embellishments that frame the drawers and sides. Their intricate shape and placement are essential for stylistic accuracy. Altering their form or removing them would make the piece unrecognizable. This is a key decorative element, so it is weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the ornate brass mounts with acanthus leaf scrolls present around the edges of both drawers and along the side panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The cabriole legs with brass sabots are characteristic of the period and provide structural balance. Their curved shape and terminal details are distinctive. Changing their form would disrupt the visual harmony and historical accuracy. This is a major design feature, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Do the legs curve outward in a cabriole fashion and terminate in brass sabots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The scalloped apron beneath the drawers is a subtle but essential design element that contributes to the elegance and fluidity of the form. Its absence would flatten the silhouette. Though less prominent than other features, it supports visual coherence and is therefore worth 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a scalloped apron below the drawers, following the curve of the bombe shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The rectangular top surface, even though replaced with LEGO tiles, must retain its shape and position. The instruction specifies replacing the marble with gray tiles, so the form must be preserved. This is a key spatial element, affecting the overall proportion, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the top surface rectangular and flush with the upper edge of the dresser body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetry of the decorative elements (brass mounts, marquetry, legs) is crucial for aesthetic balance and historical fidelity. Asymmetry would break the design logic. This is a secondary but important compositional feature, so it is weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Are the decorative elements (brass mounts, marquetry, legs) symmetrically arranged on both sides of the dresser?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
