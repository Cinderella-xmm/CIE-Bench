Description of reference image: The original image shows two people inside a café-like setting. One person is seated and holding a cake with lit candles, smiling towards the camera. Another person is standing beside them, seemingly throwing a gray object, possibly flour, over the seated individual's head. Behind them, there is a well-lit interior with various items like shelves, a refrigerated section containing beverages, menu boards with text, and a variety of wall decor including illustrations and small objects. Both individuals appear to be enjoying a casual, festive moment.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

- The specific doll figure and wooden stump are removed and replaced with an oil painting-style artwork.
- The color palette of the new artwork should be adjusted to warm tones.
- The texture of the artwork should resemble a canvas.
  
### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

#### Thinking process:
- **Core recognition elements:** The seated person holding the cake and the standing person’s action of throwing the gray object are critical as they define the key action and atmosphere of the scene.
- **Functional/logical elements:** The positioning of the cake in the seated person's hands and the trajectory of the thrown object are necessary for maintaining the logical flow of the interaction.
- **Remaining elements based on visual coherence:** Details such as the cake with candles, the café background elements, and the lighting should be kept consistent to preserve the setting and mood.

#### Preservation Targets List:
- The seated person holding the cake.
- The standing person’s action of throwing the gray object.
- The cake with candles.
- The café background and lighting.
