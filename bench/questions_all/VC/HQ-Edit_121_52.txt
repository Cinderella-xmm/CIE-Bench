Description of reference image: The subject is a female astronaut standing on the lunar surface, facing slightly toward the viewer with her right arm raised in a dynamic pose. She wears a detailed white NASA-style spacesuit with red trim along the sleeves and legs, featuring a prominent American flag patch on the left shoulder. The suit includes a life-support pack on the back, multiple control modules and gauges on the chest, and a clear helmet visor through which her face is visible—she has long blonde hair, blue eyes, and a neutral expression. Her boots are black and sturdy, kicking up fine lunar dust as she steps forward. The background consists of a star-filled dark sky with a bright, glowing Earth visible in the upper left, casting a soft light across the scene. The lunar terrain is rugged, covered in craters and footprints, with subtle shadows enhancing the three-dimensional texture of the surface.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Transform the astronaut into a cartoon-style character postcard" → This indicates a full stylistic transformation of the subject’s form, including exaggeration and stylization.  
- "Enlarge the astronaut's pose with action zig-zags" → The pose can be exaggerated and dynamic; action lines (zig-zags) may be added to suggest motion.  
- "Stylize the suit with celestial motifs in blues and silvers" → The suit’s color scheme and patterns can be altered to include cosmic designs, replacing original textures and colors.  
- "Add an illustrated moon surface beneath" → The lunar surface can be reimagined as a cartoonish, illustrated version rather than photorealistic.  
- "Print on textured white card stock with space-themed border for collectible appeal" → This refers to physical output format and framing, not visual content of the image itself.  

Thus, the **subject’s form**, **pose**, **suit design**, **color palette**, and **background environment** are all explicitly allowed to change under the instruction. However, the **identity of the subject as an astronaut** must still be recognizable, even if stylized. The **American flag patch**, **helmet structure**, **spacesuit silhouette**, and **lunar setting** are implied to be retained in concept, though not necessarily in detail.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The astronaut’s pose (can be enlarged and dynamic with zig-zag motion lines)  
- The suit’s design (can be stylized with celestial motifs in blue and silver)  
- The suit’s color (original white/red can be replaced with blue/silver)  
- The lunar surface (can be replaced with an illustrated version)  
- The overall art style (can shift from realistic to cartoon)  
- Background elements (Earth, stars, lighting) can be reinterpreted or simplified  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The identity of the subject as an astronaut is central. Even in cartoon form, key identifiers must remain to preserve recognition. These include:  
- The presence of a helmet with a clear visor showing facial features (especially the hairstyle and facial structure)  
- The general shape of the spacesuit with articulated joints and life-support backpack  
- The American flag patch (a symbolic identifier of national affiliation in space missions)  
- The fact that the figure is standing on a moon-like surface (even if stylized)  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The helmet must remain functional in appearance (i.e., enclosing the head, protecting the face)  
- The suit must retain its layered, segmented structure to imply mobility and protection  
- The backpack must remain attached and positioned correctly to maintain logical coherence of the astronaut’s gear  

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding all elements explicitly allowed to change (pose, style, colors, surface), what remains are the core structural and symbolic features that define the astronaut’s identity and context. These include:  
- The helmet’s circular shape and transparent visor  
- The flag patch’s position and basic shape (red, white, blue stripes and stars)  
- The suit’s joint articulation at elbows, knees, and hips  
- The boots’ placement and interaction with the ground (kicking up dust)  
- The Earth in the background (as a contextual anchor)  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The presence of a clear helmet visor revealing the astronaut’s face  
- The American flag patch on the left shoulder  
- The backpack attached to the suit  
- The helmet’s circular shape and reflective surface  
- The suit’s segmented, pressurized design with visible joints  
- The boot interacting with the lunar surface, causing dust displacement  
- The Earth visible in the sky behind the astronaut  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The clear helmet visor revealing the astronaut’s face is a core identification feature. Without it, the subject would lose its human identity and become unrecognizable as a person in a spacesuit. The visibility of facial features like eyes, nose, and hair is essential for maintaining the original subject’s identity. If the visor is obscured or removed, the character becomes anonymous, violating the identity preservation principle. This is a 3-point element because it directly enables recognition of the subject as a specific individual in a space suit.  
Question: Is the astronaut's face visible through a clear, circular helmet visor?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The American flag patch is a key symbolic element identifying the astronaut’s nationality and mission context. Its presence and position on the left shoulder are standard in NASA imagery and serve as a strong visual anchor. Changing its location, removing it, or altering its colors would break the connection to real-world space exploration history. It is a 3-point element due to its iconic status and role in establishing the subject’s identity within the context of U.S. space missions.  
Question: Is there a red, white, and blue American flag patch located on the left shoulder of the suit?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The backpack is a functional component of the spacesuit, providing life support. Its presence and attachment to the back are critical for maintaining the logical coherence of the astronaut’s equipment. Removing or altering its shape would make the suit non-functional and disrupt the realism of the scene. While the design can be stylized, its existence and position must be preserved. This is a 2-point element because it supports the functionality and plausibility of the astronaut’s gear.  
Question: Is there a large, boxy life-support pack attached to the astronaut’s back?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The segmented structure of the suit, particularly at the joints (elbows, knees), is essential for indicating mobility and the engineering of a real spacesuit. These details distinguish it from generic clothing or fantasy armor. Altering or smoothing out these segments would make the suit appear unrealistic or misidentified. This is a 2-point element because it maintains the technical authenticity of the suit’s design.  
Question: Are there visible segmented joints at the elbows and knees of the spacesuit?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The boot interacting with the lunar surface and displacing dust is a key detail indicating movement and physical interaction with the environment. This dynamic element grounds the astronaut in the lunar setting and adds realism. Even if the surface is stylized, the boot’s contact with the ground and resulting dust trail must be preserved to maintain environmental logic. This is a 1-point element because it is a minor but coherent detail supporting the scene’s realism.  
Question: Is there visible dust being kicked up from the lunar surface beneath the astronaut’s right boot?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The Earth visible in the background serves as a contextual landmark, anchoring the scene in space and identifying the location as the Moon. Its presence is crucial for situating the astronaut in a recognizable astronomical setting. While its size or brightness may change, its existence as a bright sphere in the sky must be retained. This is a 2-point element because it provides essential environmental context.  
Question: Is a bright, spherical Earth visible in the sky behind the astronaut?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The helmet’s circular shape and reflective surface are defining features of a space helmet. A non-circular or opaque helmet would fail to represent a traditional astronaut helmet. This shape is iconic and necessary for visual recognition. While internal reflections may change, the outer form must remain circular. This is a 2-point element because it defines the helmet’s identity.  
Question: Is the helmet shaped as a smooth, circular dome with a reflective outer surface?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
