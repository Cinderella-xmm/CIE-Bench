### Step 1 - Analyzing Allowed Changes and Determining Reference Image Details

**Description of reference image:** The subject is a single adhesive bandage lying flat on a smooth, gradient-colored surface transitioning from a warm yellow to a cool blue. The bandage has a rounded rectangular shape with a central adhesive strip that appears lighter in color compared to the rest of the bandage. The lighting highlights the texture of the bandage material, casting a subtle shadow to the right, enhancing its three-dimensional appearance.

**Thinking process:** The editing instructions specify transforming the bandage into a Funko Pop-inspired packaging design while retaining certain elements. The bandage's core identity and some physical characteristics must remain intact. The scene can be altered significantly, including the background and the addition of new elements like the packaging and chibi-style illustration.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The bandage can be reimagined as a Funko Pop-style figure inside a box.
- The scene can be changed to include the packaging and a chibi-style representation.
- The bandage can be depicted in a more stylized manner inside the packaging.
- The background and lighting can be adjusted to fit the new theme.

### Step 2 - Determining Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking process:** Core recognition elements include the bandage's basic shape, texture, and adhesive strip. Functional elements like the adhesive area's placement and the bandage's overall proportions must be preserved. Remaining elements, such as the subtle shadow and material texture, contribute to visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The bandage's rounded rectangular shape.
- The central adhesive strip's position and relative size.
- The texture of the bandage material.
- The bandage's overall proportions.

### Step 3 - Generating Questions

**Q1:**
Thinking process: The bandage's rounded rectangular shape is a core recognition feature. Losing this shape would make it unidentifiable as a bandage, impacting its core identity.
Question: Does the bandage retain its rounded rectangular shape?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 3

**Q2:**
Thinking process: The central adhesive strip is a key functional element that distinguishes the bandage. Its position and relative size are crucial for maintaining the bandage's identity.
Question: Is the central adhesive strip still present in the same relative position and size?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 3

**Q3:**
Thinking process: The texture of the bandage material is an important detail that contributes to its realism and identity. Retaining this texture helps maintain visual consistency.
Question: Does the bandage retain its visible fabric texture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2

**Q4:**
Thinking process: The bandage's overall proportions are essential for maintaining its recognizable form. Significant distortion would compromise its identity.
Question: Are the bandage's overall proportions consistent with the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2

**Q5:**
Thinking process: The shadow cast by the bandage adds depth and realism. While not a core element, it contributes to the visual coherence of the image.
Question: Is there a shadow cast by the bandage, contributing to its three-dimensional appearance?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 1

These questions focus on the key visual elements of the original image, ensuring that the core identity, functional aspects, and visual coherence are retained after editing.
