      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The dark brown color of the chocolate cake layers is the primary identifier of the whoopie pie. Without this color, the object would not be recognizable as a chocolate-based dessert. Even in cartoon form, the character’s head/body must retain this hue to maintain identity. Therefore, preserving the dark brown color of the outer layers is a core recognition feature, making it a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Does each whoopie pie character retain a dark brown chocolate-colored outer layer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The white cream filling is a defining structural and visual component of the whoopie pie. It separates the two chocolate layers and provides contrast. Removing or altering it would fundamentally change the object's identity. The instruction specifies using the \"creamy center\" as part of the character’s body, so its presence is essential. Thus, this is a core identity feature with high weight.",
      "question": "Is there a visible white cream filling between the two chocolate halves of each whoopie pie character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The sandwich structure—two rounded cake layers enclosing a filling—is unique to whoopie pies. Changing this to a single layer or removing the filling would destroy the object’s identity. The instruction explicitly uses this structure for character design (\"chocolate tops and creamy centers for heads and bodies\"), confirming its necessity. Hence, the layered structure must be preserved.",
      "question": "Does each whoopie pie character maintain a two-layered structure with an inner filling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The white plate serves as a functional base and is referenced in the narrative (“sit on the edge of the plate”). While its appearance may be stylized, its presence is required for continuity in Panel 1. Removing it would break the scene logic and contradict the instruction. Therefore, the plate must remain as a base element.",
      "question": "Is there a white plate present beneath the whoopie pie characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that two pies are positioned on the edge of the plate in Panel 1. This spatial relationship is critical to the narrative and visual storytelling. Even if stylized, the relative placement of two pies at the edge must be preserved to maintain consistency with the original composition and intended scene.",
      "question": "Are at least two whoopie pie characters positioned on the edge of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The round shape of the whoopie pies is fundamental to their identity. Any significant deviation (e.g., square or irregular shapes) would make them unrecognizable. The instruction retains the use of the \"tops\" and \"centers\" as parts of characters, implying the original shape is maintained. Thus, circular form is a core visual trait.",
      "question": "Are all whoopie pie characters circular in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The contrast between the dark chocolate and white cream is a key visual cue for recognition. While the instruction allows \"vibrant flat colors,\" it specifies retaining the chocolate and creamy centers, meaning the color pairing must be preserved. Altering this would reduce clarity and recognition.",
      "question": "Is there a clear contrast between the dark brown outer layers and the white inner filling of each whoopie pie character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The cracked surface texture of the chocolate top adds realism and identifies the baked nature of the cake. While the instruction allows stylistic simplification, it does not require its removal. As a minor detail contributing to authenticity, its retention helps preserve the original appearance, though loss would not prevent recognition.",
      "question": "Do the chocolate tops of the whoopie pie characters show signs of surface cracking or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
