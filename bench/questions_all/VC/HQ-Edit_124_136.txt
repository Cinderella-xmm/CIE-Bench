**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and mustache, wearing a brown patterned turban and ornate traditional robes in earthy tones with intricate embroidery. He is seated cross-legged in a vibrant field of orange, pink, and white flowers under a soft sky with streaked clouds. The man holds a lute-like string instrument with a pear-shaped body, a wooden neck, and tuning pegs at the top; the soundboard features a circular decorative rosette with a woven mesh pattern. His right hand plucks the strings while his left hand presses the frets. The background includes distant mountains and a wide expanse of blooming flowers, suggesting a peaceful, natural setting. The lighting is warm, indicating either sunrise or sunset, enhancing the golden hues of the scene.

**Thinking process:**  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word to determine what can be changed:

- "Transform the musician into a Byzantine monk" → **Subject identity changes**: The figure’s role, clothing style, and religious affiliation are to be altered.
- "Aramaic scripts woven into his elaborate robe" → **Robe details change**: Textual elements (scripts) are added, implying the original robe design will be modified.
- "Convert instrument to a lyre with scribed bronze details" → **Instrument form changes**: The lute is replaced with a lyre; material and decorative elements (bronze, scribed patterns) are new.
- "Lush field becomes idyllic garden with olive trees" → **Scene environment changes**: The floral field is replaced with a garden containing olive trees.
- "Blend Byzantine mosaic art style: jewel-toned colors, tessellated patterns" → **Artistic style change**: Color palette and texture treatment shift toward mosaic aesthetics.
- "Adjust figure to seated position on a carved stone bench" → **Posture and support object change**: Seating surface changes from ground to bench.
- "Surrounded by small marble sculptures of cherubim and sacred symbols" → **New environmental objects added**: Sculptures not present originally.

Thus, **allowed changes** include:
- Subject’s identity (from folk musician to monk)
- Clothing style and textural details (adding Aramaic scripts)
- Instrument type and material (lute → lyre with bronze)
- Background scenery (flower field → garden with olive trees)
- Artistic rendering style (realistic → mosaic)
- Seating surface (ground → stone bench)
- Additional objects (marble sculptures)

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Subject's identity (musician → Byzantine monk)
- Robe design (including addition of Aramaic scripts)
- Musical instrument (lute → lyre with bronze details)
- Background landscape (flower field → garden with olive trees)
- Artistic style (realistic painting → Byzantine mosaic aesthetic)
- Seating surface (ground → carved stone bench)
- Environmental additions (marble sculptures of cherubim and sacred symbols)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Now, identify elements that **must remain unchanged**, based on exclusion from the allowed changes list and logical necessity:

1. **Core recognition elements**: These are unique visual identifiers that define the original subject and scene. Even if transformed, some aspects may be retained for consistency unless explicitly changed. However, since the instruction allows full transformation of the subject and scene, only those **not mentioned as changeable** should be preserved.

   - But note: The instruction **does not specify retention** of any original element — it prescribes full transformation. Therefore, no element is *explicitly* required to be kept.

   - However, **visual coherence and identity preservation** require retaining certain **iconic forms** even when transformed, especially if they serve as anchors for recognition.

   - For example: The **presence of the musical instrument** is central to the subject’s function. Though its form changes (lute → lyre), the **function of playing music** remains. But the **specific shape of the original lute** is not required to be preserved.

   - Similarly, the **beard and age** of the man are not specified to change — but since he becomes a monk, facial hair may still be retained (as monks often have beards). So this is **not necessarily preserved**, but possibly retained due to continuity.

   - However, the **original image has specific visual traits** that are not mentioned in the instruction as being changed — such as the **texture of the turban**, **color of the robe**, **pose of the hands**, etc. But since these are part of the **clothing and posture** which are being transformed, they are **not guaranteed to be preserved**.

   - Crucially: The instruction does **not mention preserving** any original visual feature. Thus, **no element is mandated to stay** unless it is **logically or functionally tied** to the scene or action.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**: These are necessary for coherence between subject and action.

   - The **hands interacting with the instrument** must retain their **functional relationship** — one hand plucking, one pressing strings — because the action of playing music is preserved. Even though the instrument changes, the **hand positions and gestures** must remain logically consistent with playing a string instrument.

   - The **seated posture** is preserved, though the seat changes — so the **cross-legged position** must remain, as it is a core part of the original pose.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:

   - Since the instruction specifies **changing** the instrument, robe, background, and seating, only **unmentioned** elements may be considered for retention.

   - But **nothing is explicitly preserved** — all major elements are targeted for change.

   - However, **some minor details** like **the direction of gaze**, **facial expression**, or **lighting tone** may be implicitly preserved unless contradicted.

   - Yet, the instruction does not mention them — so they are **not required to be retained**.

   - **Conclusion**: No element is **mandated to be preserved** by the instruction. All changes are permitted.

   - But: As a professional consistency assessment expert, we must **identify elements that, if lost, would break visual logic or identity**, even if not explicitly required.

   - For instance: If the **man’s face** is completely replaced with a different one, it would violate continuity. But since he becomes a monk, **his face may be retained** if it aligns with the new identity.

   - However, the **original image’s key identifying features** — such as the **white beard**, **turban**, **robe color**, **instrument shape**, **flower field** — are **all subject to change**.

   - Therefore, **no original visual element is strictly required to be preserved** unless it serves a **core functional or logical purpose**.

   - But: The **act of playing music** is preserved — thus, the **interaction between hands and instrument** must be **retained in form**, even if the instrument changes.

   - Also, the **seated posture** is preserved — so the **cross-legged position** must remain.

   - The **orientation of the figure** (facing forward, looking slightly upward) may be preserved for compositional continuity.

---

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The **cross-legged seated posture** of the figure
- The **functional hand positioning** (right hand plucking, left hand fretting) relative to the instrument
- The **forward-facing orientation** of the figure (head and torso facing viewer)
- The **presence of a long white beard and mustache** (if consistent with Byzantine monk imagery)
- The **overall scale and proportion** of the figure relative to the environment

> Note: These are **not explicitly preserved** in the instruction, but they are **logical necessities** for maintaining coherence between the original and edited version, especially since the transformation is not radical enough to discard all physical traits.

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Now, extract **key identifying visual elements** from the original image that are **not explicitly changed** in the instruction and generate **specific, unambiguous yes/no questions**.

Each question must:
- Be based on a **clearly visible feature** in the original image
- Not rely on abstract or subjective qualities
- Directly test for presence/absence of a **core or important visual trait**
- Avoid overlap
- Assign weight based on importance

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The cross-legged seated posture is a core compositional element of the original image, defining the figure’s interaction with the environment. It is not mentioned in the instruction as being changed, and changing it would disrupt the tranquil, grounded nature of the scene. Even though the seating surface changes, the posture itself must remain to preserve the figure’s orientation and balance. This is a key functional and spatial element, hence weight 3.
    Question: Is the figure seated in a cross-legged position?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The right hand is positioned over the strings, actively plucking them, while the left hand is placed on the neck near the tuning pegs, pressing the strings. This functional interaction is essential to the act of playing music. Although the instrument changes, the hand gestures must remain logically consistent with string instrument performance. This is a critical functional detail, so its retention ensures coherence in action. Weight 3.
    Question: Is the right hand positioned above the strings in a plucking gesture?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The left hand is clearly placed on the neck of the instrument, fingers pressing down on the strings, indicating fretting. This is a functional requirement for playing a string instrument. Even with a new instrument (lyre), this gesture must be preserved to maintain the musical action. Loss of this would make the figure appear inactive. Weight 3.
    Question: Is the left hand positioned on the neck of the instrument with fingers pressing the strings?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The figure faces directly toward the viewer, with the head slightly tilted upward, creating a sense of engagement and serenity. This orientation is a key compositional element and is not mentioned as being changed. Altering the gaze direction would significantly affect the emotional tone and narrative focus. While not a core identity feature, it is a crucial aspect of the scene’s atmosphere and visual balance. Weight 2.
    Question: Is the figure facing forward with the head slightly tilted upward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The long white beard and mustache are prominent features of the original figure, contributing to his identity as an elder. While the instruction transforms him into a Byzantine monk, many monastic traditions include beards. Since the instruction does not specify removing facial hair, and it is a defining characteristic of the original image, its retention helps maintain continuity in appearance. It is a secondary but recognizable trait. Weight 2.
    Question: Does the figure have a long, flowing white beard and mustache?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The turban is a distinctive headwear in the original image, forming a key part of the character’s cultural attire. Although the instruction transforms the figure into a Byzantine monk, who may wear a different head covering, the turban’s shape and texture are not explicitly replaced. However, since the instruction implies a full costume change, the turban may be replaced. But if it is retained, it would be a detail of continuity. Given that it is not mentioned as being changed, and its texture and form are visually distinct, its retention could help anchor the figure. However, it is not essential to identity after transformation. Weight 1.
    Question: Is the figure wearing a brown, textured turban?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The instrument has a pear-shaped body with a circular rosette on the soundboard. While the instruction replaces it with a lyre, the **presence of a string instrument** is preserved. The **soundboard area** is where the rosette was — this location must be maintained in the new instrument for functional consistency. Even if the shape changes, the **area of the soundboard** must be present. This is a minor but logical detail. Weight 1.
    Question: Is there a visible soundboard area on the instrument?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
