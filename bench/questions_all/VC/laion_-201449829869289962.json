      "thinking_process": "The onion-shaped dome is the most iconic architectural feature of the church tower, distinguishing it from other regional churches. Its silhouette is central to the identity of the structure. Even if the material changes to copper, the shape must remain identical for recognition. Loss of this shape would fundamentally alter the building’s identity.",
      "question": "Is the onion-shaped dome on top of the bell tower retained in the same form?",

      "thinking_process": "The clock face with Roman numerals and blue hands is a functional and visually distinct detail. It serves both as a timepiece and a decorative element. Its specific design (including numeral style and hand color) is critical for maintaining the authenticity of the tower. Any alteration would compromise its recognizability.",

      "thinking_process": "The bell tower is physically connected to the main church body and positioned to its left side. This spatial relationship is essential for structural and compositional accuracy. Changing it would disrupt the logical architecture of the building.",
      "question": "Is the bell tower attached to the church and positioned on its left side?",

      "thinking_process": "The cross atop the dome is a symbolic and religious element that identifies the structure as a Christian church. Its presence is essential for cultural and architectural recognition. Removing it would undermine the building’s identity.",
      "question": "Is the cross mounted at the very top of the dome?",

      "thinking_process": "The stone base of the tower is made of light gray masonry blocks, forming a clear contrast with the upper plastered sections. This material transition is a key textural detail that defines the tower’s construction. Altering it would misrepresent the original building.",
      "question": "Is the lower portion of the bell tower constructed from light gray stone blocks?",

      "thinking_process": "The terracotta-tiled roof of the church body is a consistent feature across the structure. Its color and slope contribute to the alpine architectural style. While the instruction allows for changes to the tower roof, the church roof must remain intact to preserve visual harmony.",

      "thinking_process": "The nearby alpine-style houses, with their sloped roofs and white walls, are part of the village setting. Their presence establishes the context of the church within a settlement. While they may be scaled down, they must remain in the scene to maintain environmental coherence.",
      "question": "Are there multiple small houses with sloped roofs visible near the church?",
