### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements include the red ski outfit, black helmet, backpack, and overall skiing activity, as these are essential for maintaining the identity of the subject and the theme of the image. Functional/logical elements like the skis and poles must be retained to support the skiing action. Remaining elements like the snowy mountain backdrop and scattered rocks contribute to visual coherence and should also be preserved.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Red ski outfit)  
(Black helmet)  
(Black backpack)  
(Skis and poles)
