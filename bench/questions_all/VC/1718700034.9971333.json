      "thinking_process": "The eyes are a key identifying feature of the subject in the original image—specifically, their large size, blue color, and direct gaze toward the viewer. These contribute to the emotional and identity recognition of the figure. If the eye color or shape were altered, the identity of the character would be compromised, especially given the emphasis on facial expression. Since the editing instruction does not mention changing the eyes, this is a core visual element that must be preserved. It is not merely a detail but a defining trait of the subject’s appearance.",
      "question": "Are the eyes blue and positioned symmetrically in the face, looking directly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The nose is a central facial landmark that contributes to the anatomical identity of the subject. Its shape—small, rounded, and proportionate to the face—is consistent with the child's age and facial structure. Altering its shape or position would disrupt facial harmony and identity. As no instruction specifies modification, it must remain unchanged. This is a core feature necessary for facial recognition.",
      "question": "Is the nose small, rounded, and centrally located on the face, aligned with the eyes and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The mouth is another key facial identifier, with a soft, closed expression and natural lip shape. Its position below the nose and symmetry relative to the face are essential for maintaining the subject’s serene demeanor. Since the instruction does not alter facial features, the mouth must remain as depicted. This contributes to the emotional tone and identity of the figure.",
      "question": "Is the mouth closed, with natural lips forming a gentle, neutral line centered beneath the nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The shirt’s color is explicitly stated to be retained (\"retaining the white tone\"). Although the material changes from plain to velvet, the color must remain white. This is a critical directive in the instruction, making the white color a preserved attribute. Changing it would violate the explicit condition, even if texture changes.",
      "question": "Is the shirt white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The posture—standing upright, facing forward, arms at sides—is fundamental to the composition and identity of the figure. It establishes the subject’s orientation and presence. The instruction does not suggest any change in pose, so this spatial arrangement must be preserved. Even with wing transformation, the body’s orientation remains central to consistency.",
      "question": "Is the subject standing upright with arms relaxed at her sides and facing directly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The skin tone is a consistent visual trait across the face and neck, appearing fair and evenly lit. This contributes to the subject’s identity and realism. Since no instruction mentions altering skin tone, and it is not part of the described modifications, it must be preserved. Loss of this would affect racial and age identification.",
      "question": "Is the skin tone consistently fair and unblemished across the face and neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetry of the face—alignment of eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth—is crucial for visual balance and identity. Asymmetric changes could misrepresent the subject. The original image shows balanced facial features, and since no modification is instructed, symmetry must be maintained. This supports accurate representation.",
      "question": "Are the facial features symmetrically aligned along the vertical midline of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
