**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

Description of reference image:  
The subject is a female gymnast performing on a balance beam in an indoor arena. She is captured mid-performance, standing upright on the beam with arms extended gracefully to the sides, her body slightly turned to the right. Her hair is tied into a neat bun secured with a red hair tie. She wears a white leotard adorned with a red sequined floral or palm-like design extending from the back down toward the lower torso, and the leotard features long sleeves and a high neckline. The leotard has subtle glittering texture, indicating sequins or reflective material. Her legs are bare, showing natural skin tone with visible muscle definition and slight shading suggesting motion and lighting. She wears white ankle socks and no shoes. The balance beam is light brown, made of wood, with a black oval logo reading “GIOROUR” in silver letters at its center. The beam rests on blue metal supports with visible branding (“GOTS”) on one leg. The floor beneath is bright blue, typical of gymnastics mats. In the background, there are blurred spectators in stadium seating, filling the stands. Other gymnasts are visible in the distance—some on beams, others preparing—wearing similar white leotards. A dark blue wall behind the beam displays a sponsor logo “Giptorht” in white text alongside a green circular emblem. Overhead lighting casts bright spots across the arena ceiling.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction specifies creating a **three-panel art print series** in **semi-realistic cartoon form**, using **flowy outfits echoing movement**, **earthy tones**, and **highlighted sequined patterns**, presented in a **dark walnut tri-fold frame**.  

Key transformation elements:
- **Art style**: From photorealistic to semi-realistic cartoon → allows stylization.
- **Outfits**: Changed to "flowy" designs → fabric texture and silhouette can be altered.
- **Color palette**: Shifted to "earthy tones" → original vibrant colors (white leotard, red design) may be modified.
- **Sequins**: To be "highlighted" → their presence must remain but can be stylized.
- **Presentation**: Must be framed in a **dark walnut tri-fold frame** → this is new, not present in original; therefore, framing is added post-edit.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Artistic style: Can shift from realistic to semi-realistic cartoon.  
- Clothing design: Outfits can become flowy and dynamic, altering cut and drape.  
- Color scheme: Original bright whites and reds can be replaced with earthy tones (e.g., browns, ochres, terracottas).  
- Fabric texture: Can be reinterpreted as flowing, animated cloth rather than tight leotard.  
- Background figures: Can be simplified or abstracted.  
- Lighting and atmosphere: Can be adjusted to suit artistic tone.  
- Frame presentation: Entirely new element; not part of original image.  

Note: While the overall scene (gymnast on beam) is preserved in concept, specific visual traits like **leotard design**, **color**, **texture**, and **style** are explicitly allowed to change per instructions.

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements must preserve what makes the subject identifiable as a gymnast on a balance beam in a competitive setting. Even if stylized, key functional and identity markers must survive:

- **Balance beam presence**: Essential for identifying the event and action. The beam's function is central — it cannot be replaced by another apparatus.
- **Gymnast’s posture and position**: Standing on the beam with arms outstretched is a signature pose that defines the moment. Its spatial relationship to the beam must remain intact.
- **Brand logos**: “GIOROUR” on the beam and “GOTS” on the support are real-world product identifiers. These are likely proprietary and should be preserved unless instructed otherwise. Since they are not mentioned for change, they must remain.
- **Beam structure and color**: Though color may shift to earthy tones, the beam’s shape, orientation, and placement underfoot must persist for functional logic.
- **Subject’s identity**: Though outfit and style may change, the core identity — a female gymnast mid-routine — must be preserved. Therefore, gender, age range, and athletic build should remain consistent.

Functional/logical association elements:
- The gymnast must be **on top of the beam**, not beside or below it. This is critical to the action’s logic.
- The beam must **support her weight** — so physical contact and balance must be maintained visually.
- The brand labels (GIOROUR, GOTS) are functional identifiers; removing them would misrepresent equipment used.

Non-modified element deduction:
After excluding changes allowed (outfit flow, color, style), the remaining elements are:
- The **beam’s label** (“GIOROUR”) — brand-specific and likely required for authenticity.
- The **beam’s physical structure** — length, height, support legs — must stay to maintain realism.
- The **position of the gymnast relative to the beam** — standing centrally, feet together, arms extended.
- The **presence of other gymnasts** in the background — though they can be stylized, their existence maintains context.
- The **arena environment** — while lighting and crowd can be simplified, the general layout (stands, mat, wall) helps ground the scene.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The balance beam with the “GIOROUR” logo clearly visible  
- The gymnast’s position atop the beam with feet planted and arms extended  
- The beam’s structural support legs with “GOTS” branding  
- The presence of multiple gymnasts in the background  
- The blue floor mat beneath the beam  
- The general indoor arena setting with audience in bleachers

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The “GIOROUR” logo is a distinct brand identifier placed centrally on the beam. It is a unique textual and graphical element that serves as a core recognition feature of the equipment. If removed or obscured, the beam loses its identifiable commercial identity, which could affect authenticity and reference value. Since the instruction does not mention changing or removing logos, this element must be retained. It is a key functional and branding detail, making it essential for consistency.  
Question: Is the “GIOROUR” logo clearly visible on the balance beam?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The gymnast is standing directly on the beam with both feet in contact, maintaining balance. This positioning is fundamental to the action being depicted. Any deviation (e.g., floating above, off to the side) would break the logical function of the scene. The stance is also iconic for balance beam routines. Thus, preserving this physical relationship is critical.  
Question: Is the gymnast positioned with both feet firmly on the surface of the balance beam?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The blue floor mat beneath the beam is a standard safety feature in gymnastics arenas. It provides contrast and defines the performance area. Its presence reinforces the authenticity of the setting. While the color might be altered to match earthy tones, the instruction does not specify changing it, so the original blue must be preserved unless explicitly overridden. As a contextual element, its retention ensures environmental coherence.  
Question: Is the blue floor mat visible beneath the balance beam?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The support legs of the beam bear the “GOTS” logo, which is a secondary but identifiable brand mark. Like “GIOROUR”, it is a real-world product label. Removing it would alter the equipment’s representation. Since no instruction calls for its removal or modification, it must remain. This is a minor but important detail for product accuracy.  
Question: Is the “GOTS” logo visible on the blue support leg of the balance beam?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The presence of other gymnasts in the background establishes context — a competition or training session. Their appearance, even if stylized, confirms the setting. Removing them would isolate the main subject and reduce narrative depth. Although their appearance can be changed, their existence is implied by the original image and should be retained for scene integrity.  
Question: Are additional gymnasts visible in the background performing on or near balance beams?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The gymnast’s hair is tied in a bun with a red hair tie, a practical and recognizable detail in competitive gymnastics. While the hairstyle may be simplified in cartoon form, the bun itself is a common identity marker. However, since the instruction allows stylistic changes, the exact shape or color may vary. But the fact that she has a bun remains a key detail. Yet, given the allowance for cartoon-style reinterpretation, this is a minor detail. Still, its presence contributes to athlete identification.  
Question: Does the gymnast have her hair styled in a bun secured with a red hair tie?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The balance beam is supported by two blue legs, forming a stable structure. This structural configuration is essential to the beam’s functionality. Changing the number or placement of supports would make it non-functional. Since the instruction does not allow such changes, the support structure must remain.  
Question: Does the balance beam rest on two blue support legs?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The audience in the bleachers provides context for a competitive event. Though the crowd can be blurred or simplified, its presence is necessary to establish scale and setting. Removing it would make the scene feel empty or staged. As a background element, it contributes to environmental coherence.  
Question: Are spectators visible in the stadium seating in the background?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q9:  
Thinking process: The dark blue wall with the “Giptorht” logo and green circular emblem is a branded backdrop. Though the text may be stylized, the instruction does not suggest removing it. It anchors the scene in a real-world sponsorship context. Retaining this enhances authenticity.  
Question: Is the dark blue wall with the “Giptorht” logo and green circular emblem visible behind the beam?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
