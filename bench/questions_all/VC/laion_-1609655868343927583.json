      "thinking_process": "The herringbone wood inlay pattern is the most distinctive visual feature of the cabinet’s surface, serving as a hallmark of its craftsmanship and period style. It is not mentioned in the editing instruction to be removed or replaced, so it must be preserved—even if transformed into a robe texture. Losing this pattern would make the edited character unrecognizable as derived from the original cabinet. Thus, this is a core identity element, warranting 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The brass ring pulls and escutcheons are signature hardware elements that define the cabinet’s decorative style. They are specifically referenced in the instruction to become “elaborate belt buckles,” which implies their **design and placement** are to be reused, not discarded. Therefore, their **presence and configuration** must be preserved, even if stylized. This is a key functional-to-symbolic transformation, making it a critical retention point.",
      "question": "Are the circular brass ring pulls and adjacent escutcheons present on the transformed character’s waist area, matching their original positions?",

      "thinking_process": "The warm amber-brown tone of the wood is essential to the cabinet’s identity and aesthetic. While the instruction allows transformation into a regal character, it does not specify a color change. Preserving the original wood color ensures visual continuity and authenticity. A shift to unrelated hues (e.g., black or blue) would break the connection to the source object. This is a core material attribute, thus weight 3.",

They are not mentioned in the transformation instruction, so they must be preserved. Their loss would result in incomplete or inaccurate representation of the original object. While not core, they contribute to visual fidelity and are therefore important enough for 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The tapered leg shape is a defining structural feature of the cabinet. Although the legs are to become clawed feet, the **tapered form** may inform the shape of the claws. Since the instruction does not specify abandoning the taper, it must be preserved in the transformation. This maintains proportional logic and visual coherence.",

The instruction states they become “functional pouches,” implying their **stacked arrangement** must be preserved. Disrupting this layout would contradict the transformation logic and reduce coherence. This is a structural necessity, hence 2 points.",

Its absence would remove a distinctive visual marker of the original cabinet. Though minor, it contributes to authenticity and must be preserved as part of the robe’s ornamentation.
