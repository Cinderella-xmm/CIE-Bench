      "thinking_process": "The grid of yellow rounded domes is the most iconic feature of the cake, distinguishing it from other desserts. Its uniformity, spacing, and yellow color are essential to recognition. If this pattern is lost or replaced, the cake would no longer be identifiable as the original. Therefore, this is a core identity element with high weight.",
      "question": "Is the grid of yellow rounded domes covering the surface of the cake present?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The red dots atop each dome are a consistent and repeated detail that adds visual rhythm and flavor indication. Their presence confirms the cake’s original decoration scheme. Removing them would alter the cake’s appearance significantly, even if the domes remain.",
      "question": "Are there small red dots on top of each yellow dome?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The cut corner revealing the internal layers is crucial to understanding the cake’s structure. The sequence of sponge, cream, and jam layers is a key identifier. If these layers are omitted or rearranged, the cake’s internal design is misrepresented.",
      "question": "Is the cross-section showing a golden sponge base, white cream layer, and deep red jam layer visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The two strawberries with green leaves are prominent toppings and serve as a signature decoration. Their placement at the top center is a fixed visual anchor. Even if reimagined as a hat, their presence and form must be retained.",
      "question": "Are two strawberries with green leaves positioned at the top center of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The scattered chopped nuts around the base are a secondary but distinctive garnish. They contribute to the cake’s presentation and help ground it visually. While less critical than the main layers, their absence would affect visual coherence.",
      "question": "Are chopped nuts visible around the base of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The square shape of the cake is fundamental to its geometry and distinguishes it from round or irregular cakes. Even in a cartoon version, the basic outline should reflect the original form.",
      "question": "Does the cake maintain a square shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "The silver-toned plate with embossed pattern provides context and elevates the presentation. While the background may change, the plate remains a key environmental element tied to the original setting.",
      "question": "Is the cake placed on a silver-toned plate with an embossed floral pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The deep red jam layer is a key flavor indicator and visual component. Its color and position between the cream and sponge are essential. Altering its hue or removing it would misrepresent the cake.",
      "question": "Is the deep red jam layer clearly visible between the white cream and golden sponge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q9",
      "thinking_process": "The white cream layer is a major structural and aesthetic component. Its thickness and position are consistent with the original design. Its removal would disrupt the cake’s internal balance.",
      "question": "Is the white cream layer visible between the sponge and jam layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q10",
      "thinking_process": "The golden sponge base is the foundation of the cake. Its texture and color define the bottom layer. Losing this would make the cake unrecognizable as a sponge-based dessert.",
      "question": "Is the golden sponge base layer visible in the cross-section?",
