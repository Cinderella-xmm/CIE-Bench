Description of reference image: The subject is a bright yellow diamond-shaped kite flying against a clear blue sky. The kite has a long tail of the same color, and there are two thin strings attached to its top corners. The sun is positioned at the top-right corner, casting a bright light across the sky. White fluffy clouds are scattered in the lower-left portion of the image.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process: Analyze the specific modifications mentioned in the instructions. The kite needs to be designed as the central visual for cultural paper postcards, suggesting that some adjustments can be made to tailor it for this purpose (e.g., paper craft model design). The scene or background may also be modified to align with the postcard aesthetic. However, the kite's fundamental characteristics should remain recognizable.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: The kite's textural details can be adapted to resemble paper craft material.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: The background can be artistically adjusted to complement the postcard theme.

### Step 2 - Determination of Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

Thinking process: Core identity elements include the kite's geometric shape, color, and strings, which are essential for recognizing it as a kite. Functional/logical associations like the kite's ability to fly via attached strings and its placement against an open sky must be maintained to keep the scene logical. Remaining visual coherence ensures the kite appears natural and aesthetically pleasing within the new context.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The kite’s overall diamond shape.
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The vibrant yellow color of the kite and its tail.
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The presence of the two strings attached to the kite.
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The kite’s placement appearing to fly against a clear sky.

### Step 3 - Generation of Yes/No Questions:

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The kite’s diamond shape is a core identification feature. Losing this shape would make the kite unrecognizable, thus it is critical with 3 points.
    Question: Is the kite depicted in the shape of a diamond?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The bright yellow color is central to the kite's identity. Changing the color would significantly alter the visual identity, but it isn't entirely unchangeable, hence given 2 points.
    Question: Does the kite retain its bright yellow color?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The strings are crucial for the kite's functional identity, showing how it is flown. Their absence would disrupt the logical understanding, so they score 2 points.
    Question: Are two strings visibly attached to the kite?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The kite floating against an open sky helps retain the visual logic and aesthetic appeal. This contributes to overall coherence, rated as 1 point.
    Question: Does the kite appear to be flying against a clear sky background?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The kite’s tail reinforces its identity and adds to the visual balance. Its presence aids in maintaining coherency, hence receiving 1 point.
    Question: Is the kite accompanied by its yellow tail?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
