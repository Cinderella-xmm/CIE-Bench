**Step 1 – Analyze the editing instructions and determine allowed changes**

Description of reference image:  
The subject is a young woman with shoulder-length black hair, styled in a neat bob cut, standing outdoors under a clear blue sky. She is wearing a red sleeveless knitted dress with thin straps, featuring visible texture and a flared skirt. Her hands are clasped together in front of her chest, fingers interlocked, with bright red nail polish. A light beige crossbody bag strap crosses her torso diagonally from her right shoulder to her left hip. Behind her, large butterfly wings are digitally superimposed—these wings have a realistic appearance with translucent blue and brown patterns, orange borders, and dark veins, resembling those of a morpho or swallowtail butterfly. The background includes a paved outdoor area with blurred figures walking (one in a pink outfit on the left, another in white shirt and red shorts on the right), green trees, and distant buildings under a sunny sky. The lighting is natural daylight, casting soft shadows.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction states: *"Create a whimsical calendar featuring the woman with butterfly wings. Cartoonize her figure, accentuating her red dress with gold embroidery. Enlarge the wings, adding intricate textures. Place each month on a different wing, and arrange the calendar on a wooden panel with floral inlay, enhancing collectible allure."*

From this, we extract the following transformational directives:
- **Cartoonize her figure**: This implies stylization of facial features, body proportions, and possibly color saturation—so naturalistic human anatomy can be altered.
- **Accentuate her red dress with gold embroidery**: The dress’s color (red) remains, but new decorative elements (gold embroidery) will be added; thus, the base red color and silhouette must remain, but surface details may change.
- **Enlarge the wings, adding intricate textures**: The wings are to be scaled up and detailed further, meaning their size and surface texture can be modified, but their presence and general shape (butterfly-like) must persist.
- **Place each month on a different wing**: This means textual content (months) will be overlaid onto the wings; hence, the wings serve as a canvas for text.
- **Arrange the calendar on a wooden panel with floral inlay**: The entire composition is to be recontextualized into a framed wooden panel with floral design—this implies the background scene (outdoor plaza) will be replaced entirely.

Thus, the **allowed changes** include:
- Transformation of the woman's figure into a cartoon style
- Addition of gold embroidery to the red dress
- Scaling and texturing enhancement of the butterfly wings
- Overlay of monthly text on the wings
- Replacement of the current background with a wooden panel featuring floral inlay

Allowed Changes List:
- The woman’s facial features and body proportions (due to cartoonization)
- The texture and pattern of the butterfly wings (enlargement and added detail)
- The addition of gold embroidery to the red dress
- The overlay of month labels on the wings
- The background environment (replaced by a wooden panel with floral inlay)

**Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged**

Thinking process:  
We now identify what **must not change**, based on exclusion from the "allowed changes" list and core identity logic:

1. **Core recognition elements**:  
   - The **woman’s face** must retain recognizable identity despite cartoonization. While features may be exaggerated, key identifiers such as **black bob hairstyle**, **dark eyes**, **smiling expression**, and **red lipstick** are essential for maintaining her identity. Even if stylized, these traits must remain identifiable.
   - The **red dress** is central to her visual identity. Though gold embroidery will be added, the **base red color** and **knitted texture** must remain, as they define her attire and contrast with the wings.
   - The **butterfly wings** are a defining feature. Although enlarged and textured, their **basic structure**—two large wings with **blue translucent center**, **brown edges**, **orange tips**, and **vein patterns**—must remain consistent enough to be recognized as the same wings. The **presence** of two wings behind her back is non-negotiable.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:  
   - The **position of the wings behind her back** must be preserved. They are attached to her upper back, forming an extension of her form. If relocated (e.g., floating freely), it breaks the logical connection between the woman and the wings.
   - The **hands clasped in front of her chest** is a pose that contributes to her demeanor. While cartoonization might simplify gesture, the **clasp position** and **interlocked fingers** must remain to preserve the original posture.

3. **Non-modified element deduction via exclusion**:  
   - The **crossbody bag strap** is visible across her torso. It is not mentioned in the instruction for modification, so it should remain unless obscured by the cartoon style. However, since it’s part of her outfit and contributes to realism, its **presence and diagonal path** should be retained.
   - The **red nail polish** is a small but distinctive detail. Though minor, it adds to her appearance and should remain unless overridden by stylistic choices. Since no instruction mentions changing nails, it must be preserved.
   - The **lighting direction and shadow cast** on her body and surroundings are implied by the original image. While the background changes, the **relative lighting consistency** (sunlit from above, shadows below) should be maintained to preserve coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
- The woman’s black bob hairstyle
- The red knitted dress (base color and texture)
- The butterfly wings’ basic shape and color scheme (blue, brown, orange, veined)
- The position of the wings behind her back
- The hands clasped in front of her chest
- The diagonal crossbody bag strap
- The red nail polish
- The smiling facial expression (including red lips and dark eyes)

**Step 3 – Generate yes/no questions targeting key identifying visual elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The black bob hairstyle is a core identifier of the subject’s appearance. Its length, straightness, and framing of the face are distinctive. Changing it significantly (e.g., longer, curly, colored) would alter her identity. Even in cartoon form, the silhouette and placement must match. Thus, preserving this hairstyle is critical for recognition.  
Question: Is the woman’s hair styled in a short, straight black bob that frames her face?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The red dress is a dominant visual element. Its color and knitted texture define her outfit. While gold embroidery will be added, the base red color and knit pattern must remain. Losing the red color or altering the fabric texture fundamentally would misrepresent the original subject.  
Question: Does the woman wear a red sleeveless dress with visible knitted texture?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The butterfly wings are central to the theme. Their specific coloration—blue translucent center, brown outer edges, orange tips, and vein patterns—are unique to this image. Even if enlarged or detailed, the fundamental color distribution and wing shape must remain recognizable.  
Question: Are the butterfly wings behind her back colored with blue centers, brown borders, and orange tips?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The hands clasped in front of the chest is a key pose that defines her posture. It conveys a gesture of joy or anticipation. Altering this (e.g., arms at sides, hands down) would change the emotional tone and break continuity.  
Question: Are the woman’s hands clasped together in front of her chest with fingers interlocked?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The crossbody bag strap is a minor but consistent detail. Its diagonal path from right shoulder to left hip anchors the composition. Removing or relocating it would disrupt visual balance and continuity.  
Question: Is there a light-colored strap crossing diagonally from her right shoulder to her left hip?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The red nail polish is a small but distinctive detail. It matches her dress and lipstick, contributing to her overall aesthetic. While not critical for identity, losing it would slightly reduce visual coherence.  
Question: Do the woman’s fingernails have bright red polish?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The facial expression—specifically the smile with visible red lips and dark eyes—is essential for emotional recognition. Even in cartoon form, the mouth shape, eye shape, and lip color must remain consistent.  
Question: Is the woman smiling with red lipstick and dark eyes visible?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
