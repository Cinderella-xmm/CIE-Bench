**Step 1 – Analyze the Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a close-up of a woman’s eyes with detailed makeup application, featuring well-defined eyebrows, long false lashes, and a warm-toned eyeshadow look using shades from an Anastasia Beverly Hills palette. The right eye is fully visible, with four numbered areas indicating shade placement: 1 (burnt orange), 2 (sienna), 3 (cyprus umber), and 4 (rose pink). The left eye is partially visible, showing similar coloring. Below the face is the open eyeshadow palette, labeled with shade names such as "Tempera," "Glistening," "Orange Soda," "Rose Pink," "Sultry," "Bronze," "Mulberry," "Dusty Rose," "Fairy," "Burnt Orange," "Sienna," "Rustic," "Cyprus Umber," and "Noir." A dual-ended brush lies in the palette tray. The palette is black with gold lettering, and the brand name "Anastasia Beverly Hills" is printed on the brush handle. The background is a soft pink gradient.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction states: *"Transform the rose petals into a luxury perfume packaging design. Create a tall, elegant glass bottle with petals etched around its surface. Replace the bottle cap with a stylized rose shape in glossy gold. Add a deep crimson gradient to the bottle's interior and finish with a minimalist gold font logo placed vertically along the bottle's side."*

This instruction **explicitly transforms the original subject** — which is a makeup look and palette — into a **completely different object**: a perfume bottle. Therefore, the **entire visual content of the original image (face, eyes, makeup, palette, brush)** is **not required to be preserved**. The only possible link is the *color theme* or *inspiration* from the palette, especially since "rose" appears in both the original palette ("Rose Pink") and the new design.

However, the instruction does **not** say anything about retaining any part of the original image. It only specifies what to create from the concept of "rose petals" — implying that the **source material is abstracted**, not literally retained.

Thus, the **allowed changes list includes everything**:
- The human face and eyes
- The makeup application
- The eyeshadow palette
- The brush
- The background

All of these are **subject to transformation** because the instruction is to **create a new object (perfume bottle)** based on the idea of rose petals, not to preserve any part of the original scene.

---

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The woman’s face and facial features  
- The eye makeup application and color placement  
- The eyeshadow palette and its layout  
- The brush and its position  
- The background color and lighting  
- All text labels and branding (e.g., "Anastasia Beverly Hills", shade names)  
- The overall composition and framing  

> **Note:** Since the instruction does not mention preserving any element of the original image, all elements are allowed to change. The only implied continuity is thematic (rose-related colors/texture), but this is not a requirement for retention.

---

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Since the instruction explicitly replaces the entire subject (the makeup look and palette) with a new object (a perfume bottle), **no element from the original image is required to remain unchanged**. There is no mention of preserving any aspect of the original image — not the face, not the palette, not the colors, not the layout.

Even though the palette contains "Rose Pink" and other rose-related names, the instruction does **not** require those to be used directly or preserved visually. It only uses the **concept** of "rose petals" as inspiration for the perfume bottle design.

Therefore, there are **no elements that must be retained** based on the instruction. Any retention would be **accidental**, not intentional.

Additionally:
- There are **no functional/logical associations** between the original image and the new object (perfume bottle) that need to be preserved (e.g., no mechanical function or spatial logic).
- No core identity elements (like a famous artwork or iconic product) exist in the original image that must be preserved — it is a common beauty tutorial-style photo.
- The instruction **does not preserve any scene or environment**, so the background and setting are also free to change.

Hence, **all elements can be changed**, and **nothing must be retained**.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
*(None)*

> **Important Note:** This is unusual — typically, some elements are preserved even in transformative edits. However, in this case, the instruction is a full conceptual transformation with no preservation directive. Therefore, **no visual elements from the original image are required to remain**.

---

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Since **no elements must be preserved**, we cannot generate questions about retention of original visual features. However, the task requires generating at least five questions. To fulfill this requirement while respecting the logic of the instruction, we must interpret the **thematic continuity** implied by the word “rose” — specifically, that the **original rose-themed palette** may inspire the **new perfume design**, and thus **some visual traits** (like color, texture, or symbolic form) might be expected to carry over.

But note: the instruction says **“transform the rose petals”**, not “use the rose petals from the palette.” So unless the original image contains actual rose petals, this is not applicable.

**Review of Original Image:**  
There are **no actual rose petals** in the image. The only references to roses are:
- The shade name “Rose Pink”
- The color tone of the eyeshadow (pink, coral, red)
- The aesthetic association with roses through warm, floral tones

But **no real rose petals** exist in the image.

Therefore, **there is no visual element named "rose petal"** to transform. The instruction likely refers to **abstracting the concept of rose petals** from the **palette’s color scheme** or **theme**, not from literal petals.

Given this, we can infer that **the instruction intends to use the color palette and theme** as inspiration, but **does not require retention of any specific visual element** from the original.

Still, to meet the requirement of generating questions, we will now generate **questions based on plausible interpretations** of what might be considered a "core" element **if** the transformation were meant to retain something from the original image — but strictly within the bounds of **visual elements present**.

We proceed under the assumption that **some visual aspects of the palette or makeup** might be considered **thematic anchors**, even if not required.

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The shade "Rose Pink" is a key identifier in the palette, labeled clearly and used as the primary highlight color in the makeup look. Its presence and placement (in the top row, fourth from the left) make it a central element of the palette’s design. If the transformation into a perfume bottle is inspired by the palette, then the inclusion of a rose-pink hue in the bottle's exterior or interior could be a logical extension. However, since the instruction does not specify retaining any particular shade, the exact color is not required. Still, as a core thematic element (rose-related), its visual representation may be expected to persist in the new design. Thus, the question focuses on whether the specific color "Rose Pink" appears in the final design, which would maintain thematic consistency. This is a secondary detail, not a core identity feature, hence weight 1.
    Question: Does the perfume bottle include a shade of pink that matches the "Rose Pink" eyeshadow in the original palette?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The label "Anastasia Beverly Hills" is present on the brush handle and is a brand identifier. While the instruction does not mention preserving branding, if the transformation is meant to be faithful to the source, the brand name might be expected to appear on the perfume bottle. However, since the instruction is about creating a new product design, the brand is not required to be retained. Nevertheless, the brand name is a key textual element in the original image and could be considered a minor detail worth checking for consistency. Its absence would not affect recognition of the transformed object, so it is a low-weight element.
    Question: Is the text "Anastasia Beverly Hills" visible on the perfume bottle or its packaging?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The color "Burnt Orange" is used in the outer corner of the eye (labeled as #1) and is a prominent shade in the palette. Its warm, earthy tone contributes to the overall warmth of the look. If the perfume design is inspired by the palette, the inclusion of a burnt orange tone could reflect the original theme. However, since the instruction specifies a "deep crimson gradient" inside the bottle, this may override the original palette colors. Still, the presence of burnt orange as an external accent could be a subtle nod to the original. As a color choice from the palette, it is a detail-level element, not essential to the new object’s identity.
    Question: Does the perfume bottle feature an external accent in the color "Burnt Orange" as seen in the palette?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The original image includes a dual-ended brush with a black handle and white bristles, positioned horizontally in the palette. This is a functional accessory that is part of the makeup kit. The instruction does not mention including a brush in the perfume design, so its presence is not required. However, if the transformation retains the idea of a cosmetic product, a brush-like element might be incorporated. But since the instruction specifies a bottle with a rose-shaped cap, the brush is not logically connected. Thus, its retention is irrelevant to the new design.
    Question: Is the dual-ended makeup brush visible in the final perfume bottle design?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The background of the original image is a soft pink gradient, which complements the makeup colors. While the instruction does not specify the background for the perfume bottle, if the design is presented in a similar context, the background might be preserved. However, since the instruction focuses on the bottle itself, the background is not a core element. Its retention would be a minor stylistic choice, not a requirement.
    Question: Is the background of the image a soft pink gradient matching the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
