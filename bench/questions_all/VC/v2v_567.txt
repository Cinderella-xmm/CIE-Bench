Description of reference image: The subject is a vintage steam locomotive arriving at a rural train station, with thick black smoke billowing from its chimney. The train is dark metallic gray in color, featuring a round front headlight, a prominent circular boiler, and a large cowcatcher at the front. It is positioned on wooden railway tracks that extend diagonally across the foreground. To the right, a brick station building with a gabled roof, light brown shingles, and two arched windows stands adjacent to the platform. On the platform, several individuals are waiting—men in suits and bowler hats, women in long dresses and wide-brimmed hats, one holding a suitcase. Their postures vary: some face the train, others stand in small groups, and one woman near the edge of the platform faces away from the viewer, carrying a rectangular leather suitcase. The scene is set during daylight under a hazy sky with soft golden lighting, suggesting late afternoon. The surrounding environment includes grassy fields, a few trees, and a distant horizon.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed: "Convert the individuals waiting at the train station into 3D chibi-style characters" — this means the form, proportions, and facial features of the people can be altered to a stylized chibi aesthetic (large heads, small bodies, simplified limbs). However, the instruction specifies maintaining their original positions, outfits, and postures — so spatial placement, clothing style, and body orientation must remain unchanged. Additionally, it explicitly states "preserving the train and station backdrop as it is" — meaning the train’s structure, appearance, position, and the station building, including architectural details, must not be modified. Therefore, changes are allowed only in the human figures’ visual representation (style), but not in their identity-defining attributes such as clothing, stance, or location.

Allowed Changes List:
- The facial features, head-to-body ratio, and overall character design of the individuals (transformed into 3D chibi style)
- The rendering style of the people (e.g., cartoonish proportions, exaggerated eyes, simplified limbs)

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The train is a central object with distinctive industrial design — its dark metallic finish, cylindrical boiler, circular front plate with rivets, headlight, and smokestack emitting dense black smoke are key identifiers of a classic steam locomotive. These features are essential for recognizing the vehicle type and era. The station building has unique architectural traits: red brick walls, gabled roof with wooden shingles, arched window frames, and a chimney — all contributing to its historical authenticity. These are core identity markers that must be preserved to maintain the scene's integrity.

Functional/logical association elements: The positioning of the individuals relative to the train and platform is critical. They are standing on the platform, facing the train, which establishes a logical narrative of waiting passengers. Changing their positions would disrupt the scene’s realism and narrative coherence. Also, the train’s alignment on the tracks and its proximity to the platform must remain consistent to preserve functional logic — a train cannot be floating or misaligned without breaking spatial plausibility.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding the allowed changes (only the stylistic transformation of people), the remaining elements — such as the train’s texture, the station’s brickwork, the platform surface, the suitcase held by the woman, the smoke plume, and the lighting — must be retained. These are not mentioned as changeable and are visually integral to the scene’s authenticity.

Preservation Targets List:
- The steam locomotive’s dark metallic body, circular front plate with rivets, headlight, and smokestack
- The shape and structure of the brick station building, including gabled roof, arched windows, and chimney
- The position and posture of each individual on the platform
- The clothing worn by each person (specific styles, colors, and accessories like hats and coats)
- The presence and position of the suitcase carried by the woman near the platform edge
- The railway tracks, including wooden sleepers and metal rails
- The direction and density of the smoke plume rising from the train
- The lighting condition and warm golden hue of the scene

Q1:  
Thinking process: The circular front plate of the steam locomotive with visible rivets is a defining mechanical feature that identifies it as a classic steam engine. Its presence and structural detail are crucial for distinguishing it from other types of trains. If this element is lost or altered, the train would no longer be recognizable as a traditional steam locomotive, undermining the core identity of the scene. This is a key visual identifier, hence assigned 3 points.  
Question: Is the circular front plate with rivets on the steam locomotive present and accurately rendered?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The brick station building with its gabled roof and arched windows is a core environmental element that defines the setting. The specific architectural style and materials (red brick, wooden shingles) are essential for establishing the historical context. Altering these would change the scene’s authenticity and period feel. This is a major scene-defining feature, thus weighted at 3 points.  
Question: Is the station building made of red brick with a gabled roof and two arched windows visible and unaltered?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The position of the individuals on the platform relative to the train and station is critical for maintaining narrative logic. The instruction requires preserving their original positions, so any shift in location would violate the editing constraints. This spatial relationship supports the scene’s realism and must be preserved. This is an important functional element, hence 2 points.  
Question: Are all individuals standing in their original positions on the platform, facing the train or grouped as in the original image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The clothing of the individuals — particularly the long dresses, suits, and wide-brimmed hats — is a key indicator of the historical period and social context. The instruction mandates retaining their original outfits, so changing fabric patterns, colors, or styles would breach the requirement. These garments are essential for identifying the time and cultural setting, making them important retention targets. Weighted at 2 points.  
Question: Do all individuals wear the same clothing items as in the original image, including long dresses, suits, and hats?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The woman near the platform edge holding a rectangular leather suitcase is a distinct figure whose accessory contributes to the narrative of travel. The presence and position of the suitcase are specific visual details that must be preserved to maintain consistency. While not a core identity element, it is a notable secondary detail that affects scene coherence. Assigned 1 point.
