### Step 1 - Analyzing Allowed Changes and Determining Reference Image Details

**Description of reference image:** The subject is a black dog lying peacefully on the ground beside a park bench. The dog has a sleek black coat and is positioned in a relaxed pose with its eyes closed. The park bench is green with a wooden seat and backrest, featuring a radio, a juice box, and a trash bag placed on top. The background consists of a grassy park area with trees scattered across.

**Thinking process:** The instructions specify transforming the image into a chibi-style sticker with a minimalist flat design. This means the dog's form, the bench, and other objects can be simplified and stylized. However, the dog's distinct characteristics, the positioning of objects on the bench, and their relative proportions should be retained. The background is to be removed, and the overall design should be clean and modern.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The dog's form can be simplified into a chibi style.
- The bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag can adopt a minimalist flat design.
- The background can be removed and replaced with transparency.
- The dog and bench can extend slightly beyond a circular frame for a playful effect.
- A bold white outline can be added around the illustration.

### Step 2 - Determining Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking process:** Core recognition elements include the dog's black coat and relaxed posture, the green bench with its specific items, and the spatial arrangement of these elements. Functional/logical associations, such as the dog lying next to the bench and the items placed on it, must also be preserved. Remaining elements like the dog's distinct features and the bench's structure contribute to visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The dog's black coat and relaxed posture.
- The green bench with its specific items (radio, juice box, trash bag).
- The spatial arrangement of the dog and bench.
- The distinct features of the dog and bench.

### Step 3 - Generating Yes/No Questions

**Q1:**
Thinking process: The dog's black coat is a core recognition feature. Losing this would make it unidentifiable as the same dog. This is a key element with a weight of 3 points.
Question: Is the dog depicted with a black coat?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 3

**Q2:**
Thinking process: The relaxed posture of the dog is crucial for maintaining its peaceful appearance. This is an important element with a weight of 2 points.
Question: Is the dog shown in a relaxed, lying-down posture?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2

**Q3:**
Thinking process: The green bench is a distinctive feature of the scene. Changing its color would alter the visual identity. This is a key element with a weight of 2 points.
Question: Is the bench depicted in green?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2

**Q4:**
Thinking process: The spatial arrangement of the dog next to the bench is essential for maintaining the scene's logic. This is an important element with a weight of 2 points.
Question: Is the dog positioned next to the bench?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2

**Q5:**
Thinking process: The presence of the radio, juice box, and trash bag on the bench is important for maintaining the scene's context. This is a detail-level element with a weight of 1 point.
Question: Are the radio, juice box, and trash bag present on the bench?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 1

These questions ensure that the core recognition features, functional/logical associations, and secondary details of the original image are retained in the edited version.
