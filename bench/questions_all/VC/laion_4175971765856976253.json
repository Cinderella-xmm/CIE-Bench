      "thinking_process": "The horseshoe-shaped grille with central mesh is a key identifying feature borrowed from real-world luxury car design, specifically associated with Bugatti models. It is positioned centrally on the front of the car and is critical for brand recognition. In the robot form, it appears on the face/upper torso area, maintaining its shape and position. Its loss would make the toy unrecognizable as a derivative of that iconic design language. Thus, it is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the horseshoe-shaped grille with central mesh present on the front of the car and on the robot’s face/torso?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The red-and-black color scheme is the dominant visual identity of the toy. The red covers the side panels, front bumper, and door sections, while black dominates the roof, hood, and lower body. This contrast is essential for visual distinction and thematic consistency across both forms. Altering the base colors would fundamentally change the toy’s identity. Therefore, this is a core recognition feature with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the side panels, front bumper, and door sections red, and the roof, hood, and lower body black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The five-spoke silver wheels are a defining detail of the car’s design and are retained in the robot’s limbs (as feet). Their shape and material finish contribute to the realistic automotive aesthetic. Changing the wheel design would disrupt the connection between car and robot forms and reduce authenticity. This is a key functional and visual detail, thus assigned a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Do both the car and robot feature five-spoke silver wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The gold-plated segmented chest armor on the robot is a unique design element that adds mechanical detail and distinguishes it from generic robot toys. It is located on the torso and has a symmetrical, layered structure. Its absence would diminish the robot’s visual complexity and uniqueness. As a key accessory-like feature, it is important for identification and thus assigned a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the robot have gold-colored segmented armor plates on its chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The structural transformation logic — where the car’s doors become the robot’s arms and the wheels become the legs — is the core functional principle of the toy. This mechanical relationship must be visually preserved to maintain the \"transformer\" identity. If the arms are not derived from the doors or legs from wheels, the toy loses its transformative essence. This is a logical-functional element, critical to identity, hence a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the robot’s arms formed from the car’s doors and fenders, and its legs from the car’s wheels and undercarriage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The positional relationship — with the car in the foreground and the robot standing behind it — establishes the narrative of transformation. This spatial arrangement helps viewers understand the dual nature of the toy. Reversing or removing this layout would confuse the viewer about the relationship between the two forms. It is an important scene element, thus assigned a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the car positioned in front of the robot, with the robot standing upright behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The white stripe accents on the front bumper and sides of the car serve as visual highlights and are consistent with the design language of high-performance vehicles. They are present on both the car and robot forms (on the robot’s shoulders and face). Removing them would reduce visual coherence and brand fidelity. While not as critical as the grille, they are important detail elements contributing to overall consistency. Assigned a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Are there white stripes on the front bumper and side panels of the car, and on the robot’s shoulders and face?",
      "choices": [
