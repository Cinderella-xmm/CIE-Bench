      "thinking_process": "The black-and-white striped pattern is the defining biological and visual feature of zebras. It is the primary identifier distinguishing them from other animals. The instruction explicitly requires retention of \"signature striped coats,\" meaning the presence, color contrast, and general layout of the stripes must remain. Loss of this pattern would render the subjects unrecognizable as zebras, regardless of any chibi styling. Therefore, this is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the zebras' bodies covered in distinct black and white stripes that follow the natural pattern seen in the original image, including variations in thickness and alignment across the torso, legs, and face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The grazing stance is a key behavioral and postural element that defines the scene's context. The instruction specifies retaining \"realistic grazing stances,\" which means the head must be lowered toward the ground, and the legs must support this position. Altering this posture would contradict the described behavior and disrupt the scene’s logic. This is a critical functional element tied to the animal’s interaction with the environment, making it a high-priority retention target.",
      "question": "Is each zebra depicted with its head lowered toward the ground in a natural grazing pose, with legs positioned to support this stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The wire fence with wooden posts is a structural element that defines the boundary of the enclosure and contributes to the realism of the setting. The instruction explicitly requires preserving the fencing, so its presence, material (wire and wood), and linear arrangement must remain unchanged. Removing or altering it would violate the directive to keep the surroundings photorealistic. This is an important scene element affecting environmental authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the horizontal wire fence with evenly spaced wooden posts clearly visible across the mid-ground of the image, separating the field from the treeline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The lush green grass field with scattered shrubs and patches of bare soil forms the primary ground surface and provides ecological context. The instruction mandates preserving the \"lush green field,\" so the color, texture, and distribution of grass and vegetation must remain consistent with the original. Any significant alteration (e.g., changing to artificial turf or removing shrubs) would compromise the photorealism requirement. This is a major environmental detail supporting scene coherence.",
      "question": "Is the ground covered in green grass with visible patches of bare soil and small green shrubs scattered throughout the field?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The background treeline and sky provide depth and atmospheric context. The instruction specifies preserving the \"lush green field and fencing,\" which includes the surrounding vegetation and sky. The dense line of green trees and bushes behind the fence, along with the clear light blue sky, are integral to the scene’s composition and realism. Altering these would disrupt the environmental continuity. While not the most critical, they are essential for maintaining the original setting.",
      "question": "Is there a continuous line of green trees and bushes behind the fence, with a clear light blue sky above the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The texture and color of the zebra’s mane are part of their natural appearance and contribute to species-specific identification. Although the instruction allows chibi-style exaggeration, it does not permit removal or fundamental alteration of the mane’s striped pattern. The mane must retain its black-and-white striped nature and upright orientation, even if stylized. This is a secondary but identifiable detail that supports accurate representation.",
      "question": "Do the zebras have short, upright manes composed of alternating black and white stripes, consistent with their body patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The hooves are functional parts of the zebra’s anatomy and are visible in the original image. They are dark in color and firmly placed on the ground, contributing to the realistic depiction of the animal’s stance. While the instruction allows stylistic changes, it does not mention altering the hooves, and since the grazing stance must be preserved, the placement and appearance of the hooves must remain consistent with the original. This is a minor but coherent detail.",
      "question": "Are the zebra’s hooves dark in color and positioned on the ground in a way that supports their grazing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
