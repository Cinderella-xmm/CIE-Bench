**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

Description of reference image:  
The subject is a natural waterfall cascading over layered, moss-covered rocks in a sunlit outdoor setting. The water flows vigorously, creating white foam and splashes as it tumbles down irregular stone surfaces. The rocks are light brown to gray in color, with visible textures such as cracks, erosion patterns, and patches of green moss or algae. The water’s surface reflects sunlight, producing bright highlights and sparkling effects. The flow direction is downward from the upper portion of the frame toward the bottom, forming multiple small cascades and rapids. The surrounding environment includes more rock formations and hints of vegetation on the right edge. The overall scene is dynamic, with motion emphasized by the frothy water and spray.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly states a transformation: "Transform the waterfall and rocks into an aquatic dragon emerging from the water..." This means the **form** of the waterfall and rocks can be altered — they are not to remain literal but instead become symbolic components of a mythical creature. Specifically:
- The flowing water becomes the **shimmering, translucent mane** → water’s form changes, but its **dynamic movement and brightness** may be preserved in stylized form.
- The rocks morph into the **scale-armored body** → their shape and structure change, but their **texture and spatial layout** (e.g., layered, rugged) may inform the dragon's design.
- The white foam forms **misty cloud wings** → foam is reinterpreted as wing material, so its **whiteness and airy texture** may be retained in abstraction.
- Glowing blue **aquatic runes** are added along the scales → these are new elements, not present in original, so no retention required.

The instruction does **not** mention preserving any specific real-world features like the actual rock shapes, water color, or background landscape. Instead, it instructs a complete **metamorphosis** of the scene into a fantasy being. Therefore, the **entire composition** is allowed to change in form, structure, and content, **except** for visual characteristics that are foundational to the original image and must be preserved due to identity or coherence.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The shape and structure of the waterfall and rocks (can be transformed into a dragon).  
- The form of the white foam (can become cloud wings).  
- The spatial arrangement of water and stone (can be reorganized into a creature silhouette).  
- Addition of glowing blue runes (new element, not required to exist in original).  
- The overall scene context (natural stream → mythical emergence).

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Although the instruction allows for radical transformation, certain **core visual properties** of the original image must remain intact to ensure consistency with the source material, especially if the edited version is meant to be a faithful reinterpretation rather than a completely abstract creation.

Core recognition elements:  
While the subject is transforming into a dragon, the **original image’s core visual identity** lies in its **naturalistic representation**: the **presence of moving water**, **rocky terrain**, and **light interaction** (sunlight reflecting off water). These are not just background details but define the image’s essence. However, since the instruction explicitly transforms these, we must assess whether **any inherent visual traits** of the original must persist even after transformation.

Functional/logical association elements:  
There are no functional relationships (like mechanical parts or human actions) to preserve. The only logic is environmental — water flows over rocks. But this logic is being replaced by a mythological narrative (dragon emerging), so **no logical dependency needs preservation**.

Non-modified element deduction:  
Despite the transformation, **certain sensory qualities** of the original image should be retained because they are essential to the **visual fidelity** of the edit. For example:
- The **brightness and sparkle of sunlight on water** — this is a defining feature of the original, and even if water becomes a dragon’s mane, it should retain **shimmering translucency**.
- The **texture of moss-covered rocks** — even if turned into scaled armor, the **greenish tint and roughness** should reflect the original rock surface.
- The **foamy white water** — though becoming cloud wings, its **white color and airy quality** must be preserved.
- The **overall downward flow** — the directionality of the cascade should be mirrored in the dragon’s emergence from below.

These are not “literal” elements but **visual signatures** that ground the fantasy interpretation in the original reality. They are **not explicitly mentioned in the instruction**, but their absence would make the edit feel disconnected from the source.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The presence of bright, reflective sunlight on water surfaces  
- The green moss or algae patches on the rocks  
- The white foamy texture of the water  
- The downward flow direction of the water  
- The rocky texture and layered structure of the stones

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The shimmering reflection of sunlight on the water is a key identifying feature of the original image. Even when transformed into a dragon’s mane, the **translucent, sparkling quality** must be preserved to maintain visual continuity. If the light reflections are absent or dull, the transformation loses connection to the original scene’s luminosity. This is a core visual trait tied to the image’s atmosphere and realism, making it a high-weight element.  
Question: Is there visible sunlight reflecting off the water surface, creating bright sparkles and highlights?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The green moss or algae growing on the rocks is a distinctive textural detail that adds biological realism to the scene. In the transformed dragon, these patches should manifest as **green-tinted scales or organic markings**, preserving the original’s naturalism. Removing or altering this green coloring would disconnect the dragon from its origin, weakening the thematic link. This is a critical detail for authenticity.  
Question: Are there visible patches of green moss or algae on the rock surfaces?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The white foam created by the turbulent water is a defining characteristic of the waterfall’s motion. In the edit, this becomes the **cloud-like wings**, so its **white color and fluffy texture** must be retained. If the foam is rendered in another color or lacks volume, the transformation fails to honor the original’s dynamics. This is a key element of the water’s behavior.  
Question: Is there white, foamy water at the base of the cascade and along the edges of the flow?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The layered, uneven structure of the rocks defines the topography of the scene. Even when reshaped into a dragon’s armored body, the **stacked, jagged appearance** of the stones should be reflected in the scale pattern. Preserving this structural rhythm ensures the fantasy form still echoes the original geology. It is a secondary but important coherence element.  
Question: Do the rocks exhibit a layered, stepped formation with visible cracks and erosion lines?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The direction of water flow — from top to bottom — is central to the image’s composition. The dragon must emerge **from below**, mirroring the water’s upward trajectory, maintaining the sense of rising motion. Reversing or flattening this direction would break the narrative logic of the transformation. This is a spatial logic element vital to consistency.  
Question: Does the water flow downward from the upper part of the image toward the lower part?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The contrast between the dark wet rock surfaces and the bright, rushing water creates depth and drama. This **contrast in tone and texture** must be preserved in the dragon’s design — e.g., darker scales vs. glowing mane. Losing this contrast would flatten the image visually. It is a compositional detail that supports the original’s aesthetic.  
Question: Is there a clear contrast between the dark, wet rock surfaces and the bright, fast-moving water?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The presence of airborne water droplets and spray near the cascade indicates the force of the flow. These tiny particles add realism and motion. In the dragon form, similar **fine mist or particle effects** should appear around the mane or wings. Their absence would reduce the sense of dynamic energy. This is a minor but perceptible detail.  
Question: Are there visible water droplets or mist suspended in the air above the falling water?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
