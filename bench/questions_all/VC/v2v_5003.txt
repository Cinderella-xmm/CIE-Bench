Description of reference image: The subject consists of a traditional wooden bow and a leather quiver filled with arrows, placed on a mossy forest floor. The bow has a classic curved design with a string attached, while the arrows are neatly arranged in the quiver, featuring fletchings with striped patterns. The background is a blurred woodland setting with trees and greenery, creating a natural and serene atmosphere.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process: The instructions specify converting the bow and quiver of arrows into origami paper designs. This means the material and texture of the bow and quiver can be changed to paper, altering their current wooden and leather appearances. However, the woodland backdrop must retain its natural appearance, indicating that the background cannot be modified.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Material and texture of the bow and quiver (from wood and leather to folded paper).
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Details of the bowstring and arrow fletchings (to match the paper design).

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The iconic shapes of the bow and quiver are essential for recognizing them even when made of paper. The curved shape of the bow and cylindrical shape of the quiver are key identifiers. The arrows' arrangement and general form should also be preserved.
Functional/logical association elements: The relative positions of the bow and quiver on the forest floor must be maintained to keep the scene logically consistent.
Remaining elements: The natural woodland backdrop, including the mossy ground and blurred trees, should be retained for visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained): Curved shape of the bow.
(Element 2 that should be maintained): Cylindrical shape of the quiver.
(Element 3 that should be maintained): Arrangement and general form of the arrows.
(Element 4 that should be maintained): Position of the bow and quiver on the forest floor.
(Element 5 that should be maintained): Natural woodland backdrop.

### Step 3 - Question Generation:

Q1:  
Thinking process: The curved shape of the bow is a core recognition feature. Losing this shape would make it unidentifiable as a bow, even in an origami form. This is a key element with a weight of 3 points.
Question: Does the edited image retain the curved shape of the bow?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The cylindrical shape of the quiver is crucial for recognizing it as a container for arrows. This is an important element with a weight of 2 points.
Question: Does the edited image retain the cylindrical shape of the quiver?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2

Q3:  
Thinking process: The arrangement and general form of the arrows are necessary for maintaining the identity of the quiver's contents. This is an important element with a weight of 2 points.
Question: Does the edited image retain the arrangement and general form of the arrows?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2

Q4:  
Thinking process: The position of the bow and quiver on the forest floor is essential for maintaining the logical consistency of the scene. This is an important element with a weight of 2 points.
Question: Does the edited image retain the position of the bow and quiver on the forest floor?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2

Q5:  
Thinking process: The natural woodland backdrop is necessary for visual coherence and maintaining the scene's context. This is a detail-level element with a weight of 1 point.
Question: Does the edited image retain the natural woodland backdrop?
Choices: Yes, No
