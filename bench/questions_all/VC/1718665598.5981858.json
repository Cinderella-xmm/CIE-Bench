      "thinking_process": "The central road is the primary subject and defines the scene’s identity. Its presence as a long linear path leading into the distance is essential for recognition. Even in cubist abstraction, the road must remain identifiable as a continuous pathway receding into the background. Without this, the image would lose its core narrative and spatial focus. This is a 3-point element because it is the foundation of the scene.",
      "question": "Is there a long, continuous road-like structure extending into the distance, serving as the central axis of the composition?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The rain is a defining atmospheric feature of the original image. It creates motion, texture, and mood. Even if stylized into geometric streaks, the presence of rain must be visually apparent through directional lines or patterns suggesting falling water. Losing this would fundamentally alter the weather context of the scene. This is a 3-point element due to its critical role in setting the tone and environment.",
      "question": "Are there visible diagonal streaks or patterns indicating falling rain across the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The telegraph poles are iconic structural elements on the right side of the road. Their distinct vertical post with a horizontal crossbar is a key identifier. In cubist style, they may be fragmented, but the basic form — a tall pole with a cross-shaped top — must remain recognizable to preserve functional logic and scene consistency. This is a 2-point element because it is important for environmental realism and layout.",
      "question": "Are there tall vertical structures with horizontal crossbars positioned along the right side of the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Trees flank the road on both sides, contributing to the rural setting. While they may be abstracted into triangles, their presence as roadside vegetation must be preserved. Their position relative to the road and guardrails helps establish the environment. Removing them would disrupt the landscape balance and make the scene feel unnatural. This is a 2-point element due to its importance in framing the road.",
      "question": "Are there tree-like forms present on both sides of the road, aligned with the guardrails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The sky contains a dramatic contrast between dark storm clouds and a luminous break near the horizon. This lighting contrast is crucial for mood and depth. Even in cubist fragmentation, the division between dark and light areas must be preserved to retain the emotional tone and visual hierarchy. This is a 2-point element because it defines the atmosphere and spatial depth.",
      "question": "Is there a visible division in the sky between dark clouds and a brighter, illuminated area near the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The guardrails on both sides of the road define the road’s boundaries and provide safety context. They are thin, metallic barriers running parallel to the road. In the edited version, they may be angular or fragmented, but their presence as lateral barriers must be preserved to maintain the road’s structure and safety implication. This is a 1-point element because it supports coherence but is less central than other features.",
      "question": "Are there barrier-like structures running along both edges of the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The central yellow dividing line is a key road marking that defines the two lanes. It reflects light on the wet surface and guides the viewer’s eye. Even if stylized, its presence as a continuous line down the center of the road must be preserved to maintain traffic logic and visual continuity. This is a 1-point element because it is a minor but functional detail.",
      "question": "Is there a continuous yellow line running down the center of the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
