Its sculptural shape and color arrangement are essential for recognition. If altered or simplified, the character would lose her distinctiveness. This is a core identity element, hence weight 3.",

      "thinking_process": "The green dress with red and orange circular patterns (some containing internal dot textures) is a defining visual trait. The instruction explicitly references mirroring this pattern in the environment, confirming its importance. Loss of this pattern would break continuity and cultural representation. This is a core identity and functional element, hence weight 3.",

      "thinking_process": "The subject’s seated posture with hands resting on her lap is explicitly required by the instruction (\"seated gracefully\"). This defines her demeanor and spatial relationship. Changing this would contradict the narrative intent. It is a key functional and compositional element, hence weight 3.",

      "thinking_process": "The multiple layered silver necklaces are a prominent cultural accessory and integral to the subject’s appearance. Their presence and stacking pattern contribute to identity. Removing or simplifying them would alter the character’s visual authenticity. This is an important accessory element, hence weight 2.",

      "thinking_process": "The gold bangles on the upper arms are specific accessories that add cultural detail. While not as central as the dress or hairstyle, they are part of the complete visual identity. Their absence would reduce authenticity. This is a secondary but identifiable detail, hence weight 2.",

      "thinking_process": "The puffed short sleeves with red-orange trim are a distinctive silhouette feature of the dress. They contribute to the garment’s cultural style and must be preserved to maintain visual consistency. This is a minor but coherent detail, hence weight 1.",
