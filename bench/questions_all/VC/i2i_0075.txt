### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List

However, there is no mention of changing the cat's species, modifying its key physical traits, or altering the setting drastically.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Angle adjustment of the cat's body and head to incorporate a right-side view.  
- Perspective modification to merge two views into one cohesive illustration.  
- Slight blending or smoothing of fur details to create a consistent look in the combined view.
