      "thinking_process": "The glowing blue orb is a core functional and narrative element in the scene. Its presence in the hands of the central character defines their role and action. The orb’s luminosity and spherical shape are key identifiers. If lost or replaced, the character’s purpose and the scene’s magic system are undermined. This is a 3-point element because it is essential for identity and function.",
      "question": "Is the glowing blue orb still present and held in the hands of the central character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The floral crown is a distinctive accessory on the archer’s head, composed of pink and red flowers arranged in a circular pattern. It is both a stylistic and symbolic feature, and the instruction explicitly requires its inclusion. Its removal or replacement would violate the editing directive and alter the character’s identity. This is a 3-point element due to its explicit mention and visual uniqueness.",
      "question": "Does the archer wear a floral crown made of pink and red flowers on her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The woven basket near the feet of the blonde-haired character is a minor but identifiable object in the foreground. It contributes to the scene’s realism and composition. Although not mentioned in the instruction, it is part of the original image and must be preserved unless explicitly removed. Its absence would create a visual gap and reduce consistency. This is a 2-point element due to its importance in grounding the scene.",
      "question": "Is there a woven basket located near the feet of the character with blonde hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The palm trees in the background are defining features of the oasis environment. Their silhouettes, frond patterns, and spacing are essential to the photorealistic setting. The instruction mandates preserving the background, so these trees must remain visually intact. Altering their shape or number would violate the preservation requirement. This is a 3-point element due to its role in establishing the scene’s identity.",
      "question": "Are the palm trees in the background retaining their original silhouettes and frond structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The reflective water surface shows clear mirror images of the palm trees and sky, contributing to the realism and depth of the scene. This reflection is a key environmental detail that must be preserved to maintain the photorealistic quality of the background. Losing this reflection would break the illusion of a natural oasis. This is a 2-point element due to its importance in environmental coherence.",
      "question": "Does the water surface reflect the palm trees and sky as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The golden-hour lighting with warm tones across the scene creates a consistent mood and directional shadowing. This lighting affects all elements and must be preserved to maintain the original atmosphere. Changing the color temperature or light direction would alter the emotional tone and visual harmony. This is a 2-point element due to its influence on the entire scene.",
      "question": "Is the lighting consistent with golden-hour warmth, casting soft shadows and warm highlights across the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The spatial arrangement of the three characters—blonde on the left with raised hand, central figure holding orb, archer crouched on the right—defines the scene’s dynamics. This layout supports the narrative and visual balance. Altering their positions would disrupt the intended composition and interaction. This is a 2-point element due to its role in scene logic.",
      "question": "Are the three characters positioned in the same relative arrangement as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
