      "thinking_process": "The dome-shaped head with three horizontal porthole eyes is the most iconic feature of the robot, serving as its primary identifier. The presence and arrangement of these eyes are critical to distinguishing this robot from others. Removing or repositioning them would fundamentally alter its identity. This is a core recognition element, making it essential to preserve.",
      "question": "Does the robot retain its dome-shaped head with three evenly spaced circular porthole eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The transparent chest panel revealing an intricate network of gears and cogs is a defining characteristic of the robot’s steampunk design. It visually communicates the internal mechanics and is central to the aesthetic. Altering or covering this panel would obscure the core functional representation and reduce authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the transparent chest panel still present, clearly displaying the internal gear system?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The segmented arms with piston-like joints are key to the robot’s mechanical appearance and movement logic. Their structure supports the idea of articulation and function. Changing their form would disrupt the mechanical coherence and weaken the steampunk theme.",
      "question": "Do both arms retain their segmented, piston-style joint construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The multi-toed feet with five claw-like appendages are distinctive and provide stability to the robot’s stance. They are integral to its biomechanical design and help anchor its identity. Modifying the number or shape of the toes would make the robot unrecognizable.",
      "question": "Are both feet equipped with exactly five claw-like toes each?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The head spires and antennae contribute to the robot’s ornamental and functional design, enhancing its steampunk aesthetic. Their specific number and placement add uniqueness. Altering them would change the robot’s silhouette and character.",
      "question": "Are there five distinct spires and antennae on top of the robot’s head, including one central and four lateral ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The internal gear system visible through the chest panel includes multiple interconnected cogs of varying sizes. This detail reinforces the mechanical complexity and is a hallmark of the design. Losing this detail would diminish the technical authenticity of the robot.",
      "question": "Are multiple interlocking gears of different sizes visible through the transparent chest panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The coloration and weathering of the robot—oxidized bronze, copper tones, and darkened joints—are essential to its antique industrial look. While lighting may shift in the diorama, the material textures and patina must remain consistent to preserve the original aesthetic.",
      "question": "Does the robot maintain its original oxidized bronze and copper color scheme with visible wear and aging effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The rivets and mechanical joints are minor but important details that enhance realism and craftsmanship. Their presence contributes to the tactile quality of the robot. Although less critical than core features, their absence would reduce visual fidelity.",
      "question": "Are the rivets and mechanical fasteners visible along the joints and edges of the robot’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
