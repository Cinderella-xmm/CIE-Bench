      "thinking_process": "The two upward-pointing antennae on the robot’s head are a defining structural feature, unique to this specific mecha design. Their removal or alteration would fundamentally change the robot’s identity, making it unrecognizable. This is a core identification element, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the robot still have two distinct upward-pointing antennae on its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The blue-tinted visor is a key facial feature that distinguishes this robot from others. It is part of the core visual identity and serves as a focal point. Losing this would impair recognition, especially in a miniature format where detail matters more. Thus, it is a critical retention point with a weight of 3.",
      "question": "Is there a blue-tinted visor visible on the robot’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The red glowing elements (on chest and eyes) are functional indicators in the original image, contributing to the robot’s menacing and active appearance. They are integral to its aesthetic identity and must be preserved even in the miniature model. Their absence would alter the robot’s character and visual tone.",
      "question": "Are there red glowing elements present on the robot’s chest and eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The segmented armor plating with visible panel lines and rivets defines the robot’s mechanical texture and realism. This surface detail is crucial for maintaining the original design language. Even in a miniature model, these textures must be preserved to ensure visual fidelity.",
      "question": "Are the segmented armor plates with visible panel lines and rivets still present on the robot’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The distant city skyline with tall towers and construction cranes is a key environmental identifier in the original scene. The instruction requires the landscape to “evoke” the original, so this skyline must be included in the miniature setting to maintain contextual consistency. Its omission would break the scene’s continuity.",
      "question": "Is the distant city skyline with tall towers and construction cranes visible in the miniature landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The scattered green trees in the foreground and midground contribute to the natural contrast in the original scene. While minor compared to the robot, they are necessary for environmental authenticity and help ground the miniature landscape. Their presence ensures the scene remains faithful.",
      "question": "Are there small green trees present in the foreground and midground of the miniature landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The dust cloud beneath the robot’s right foot indicates motion and adds dynamism to the pose. This detail enhances the sense of action and must be preserved in the miniature version to maintain narrative coherence and visual impact.",
      "question": "Is there a visible dust cloud beneath the robot’s right foot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
