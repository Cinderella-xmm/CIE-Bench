### Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a skateboarder captured mid-air performing a trick over a graffiti-covered ramp. He is wearing a black T-shirt, blue jeans, and black sneakers. His hair is tousled, and his arms are extended for balance. The background consists of a dimly lit indoor skatepark with graffiti art on the walls and ceiling lights illuminating the scene. The skateboarder's dynamic pose and the vibrant graffiti create a lively and energetic atmosphere.

### Thinking Process:
The editing instructions specify transforming the skateboarder into a Funko Pop figure packaging design while retaining certain elements. The core identity of the skateboarder, including his attire and action, must be preserved. The scene's graffiti backdrop is not required to be retained, allowing for changes in the background. However, the skateboarder's iconic pose and accessories (skateboard, helmet, jeans, and black shirt) are crucial for maintaining the subject's identity.

### Allowed Changes List:
- The skateboarder's form can be transformed into a chibi-style Funko Pop figure.
- The scene can be changed to a packaging design with an isometric perspective.
- The background graffiti can be replaced with a stylized Funko Pop box design.
- The skateboarder's proportions can be adjusted to fit the Funko Pop style.

### Thinking Process:
Core recognition elements include the skateboarder's attire (black shirt, blue jeans, black sneakers), the skateboard, and the dynamic pose. These elements define the subject's identity and must be retained. Functional/logical association elements, such as the skateboard and the pose, are essential for depicting the action and cannot be altered without disrupting the logical consistency. Remaining elements, like the specific colors and textures of the clothes and skateboard, contribute to visual coherence and should be preserved.

### Preservation Targets List:
- The skateboarder's black shirt, blue jeans, and black sneakers.
- The skateboard and its position relative to the skateboarder.
- The dynamic pose of the skateboarder.
- The detailed textures and colors of the skateboarder's attire and skateboard.
