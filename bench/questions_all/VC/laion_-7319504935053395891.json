      "thinking_process": "The tiered conical structure is the defining architectural form of the chocolate tower. It is not just a shape but a hierarchical system of levels that visually communicates abundance and celebration. If this structure is altered—such as becoming cylindrical or flat—the identity of the object as a \"chocolate tree\" is lost. Therefore, preserving the **stacked, conical tiers** is essential for recognition. This is a core identity feature, making it a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Is the conical, tiered structure composed of multiple horizontal levels stacked vertically preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The teardrop-shaped chocolate droplets are central to the design, serving as both visual focal points and product representations. Their presence in the center of each tier, filled with nuts, is a signature element. Removing or replacing them with different forms (e.g., spheres or cubes) would fundamentally alter the product’s identity. Thus, their **shape and placement** are critical retention criteria.",
      "question": "Are the teardrop-shaped chocolate droplets positioned at the center of each tier preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The chocolate pinecone-like supports between tiers are distinctive decorative elements that enhance the festive, natural theme. They are not merely structural but stylistic, contributing to the \"tree\" motif. Changing their form (e.g., to leaves or geometric shapes) would disrupt the cohesive aesthetic. Their **presence and form** are important for visual consistency.",
      "question": "Are the chocolate pinecone-like structures supporting each tier preserved in their original form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The internal content of the droplets—specifically the visible mix of nuts such as almonds, pecans, and hazelnuts—is a key selling point and visual indicator of quality. The instruction requires “revealing chocolate layers inside,” which implies that the **nut fillings must remain visible**. If obscured or replaced, the product’s appeal is compromised.",
      "question": "Are the nuts (including almonds, pecans, and hazelnuts) visibly contained within the teardrop-shaped droplets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The base of the structure features a distinct circular platform with a band displaying text. Although the brand name changes, the **position and format of the branding area** must remain unchanged to maintain logical placement and visual balance. The base’s **width and layered design** are part of the original form and must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the wide, circular base with a horizontal band at its edge preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The dominant color palette—deep brown with gold accents—is central to the luxurious aesthetic. The instruction specifies “deep brown hues,” so the **primary color scheme** must be maintained. Altering it to pastels or bright colors would contradict the premium branding intent.",
      "question": "Is the overall color scheme dominated by deep brown tones with gold highlights preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetry and central alignment of the droplets ensure visual harmony and balance. Misalignment or asymmetry would disrupt the elegance implied by the original design. This **spatial relationship** is crucial for maintaining the intended aesthetic.",
      "question": "Are the teardrop-shaped droplets centrally aligned along the vertical axis of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
