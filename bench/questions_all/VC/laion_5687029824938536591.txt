Description of reference image: The subject is a Salomon Speedcross 5 trail running shoe, presented in a side profile view against a plain white background. The shoe is predominantly black with subtle gray and red accents. It features a mesh upper with reinforced synthetic overlays forming triangular patterns across the midfoot for structural support. The lacing system includes flat black laces threaded through fabric eyelets, with a prominent "SPEEDCROSS" branding along the lateral side in white text with a multicolored stripe (yellow, blue, red). The Salomon logo appears in white on the heel counter and tongue tab. A small red label near the heel reads "LT LIGHT WEIGHT MIDSOLE," indicating a lightweight construction. The outsole has deep, aggressive lugs for traction, with "contagrip" written in red on the lateral forefoot. The toe cap is reinforced with a textured rubber overlay, featuring an embossed Salomon "S" logo. The overall design emphasizes durability, grip, and performance for off-road terrain.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed:  
- "Convert the shoe into a carved wooden sculpture" → This indicates the material and physical form of the subject are to be transformed; thus, the original textile and synthetic materials, textures, and colors (e.g., black mesh, rubber outsole) are no longer required.  
- "Preserving the intricate panel and lace details using deep grooves and highlighted grain patterns" → This specifies that **the shape and structure** of panels, laces, and key contours must be retained but reinterpreted in wood carving style.  
- "Use a mix of dark and light wood tones to reflect the original black and gray shades" → Color scheme is allowed to change, but **the tonal contrast** (dark vs. light) must mirror the original’s visual hierarchy.  
- "Display the wooden shoe on a minimalist gallery shelf" → The **scene/environment** is being replaced entirely; thus, the original white background is not required.  

Allowed Changes List:  
- Material of the shoe (from synthetic textiles/rubber to carved wood)  
- Surface texture (from smooth mesh and rubber to wood grain and grooves)  
- Color palette (from black/gray/red to dark/light wood tones)  
- Background environment (from plain white to minimalist gallery shelf)  
- Lighting and shadows (to suit artistic display context)  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The shoe's identity as a **Salomon Speedcross 5** hinges on its **distinctive silhouette**, **panel configuration**, **branding placement**, and **outsole pattern**. These are essential for public recognition. Even if converted to wood, the **overall shape**, **triangular overlays**, **lacing path**, and **logo locations** must be preserved to maintain brand and model identity.  
Functional/logical association elements: The **lacing system** must remain structurally accurate because it is part of the shoe’s functional design — altering its path or number of eyelets would misrepresent the product. The **outsole lug pattern** is critical for identifying it as a trail shoe; changing this would compromise its functional representation.  
Non-modified element deduction: Although material and color are allowed to change, **specific visual identifiers** such as the **position of the "SPEEDCROSS" text**, the **Salomon logo on the heel and tongue**, the **"contagrip" marking**, and the **"LT" label** must be preserved in location and form (though rendered in wood carving), as they are integral to product identification. Additionally, the **toe cap shape**, **midfoot cage**, and **heel counter structure** must retain their spatial relationships to preserve the shoe’s architectural integrity.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The triangular panel structure across the midfoot  
- The position and orientation of the "SPEEDCROSS" text on the lateral side  
- The placement of the Salomon logo on the heel and tongue  
- The shape and layout of the lacing system including eyelet positions  
- The outsole lug pattern and "contagrip" text location  
- The toe cap shape and embossed "S" logo  
- The "LT LIGHT WEIGHT MIDSOLE" label position and shape

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The triangular panel structure is a defining design feature of the Salomon Speedcross series, serving both aesthetic and structural purposes. Its presence and arrangement are critical for identifying the model. If lost or altered in shape, the shoe would no longer be recognizable as a Speedcross. Thus, preserving the **triangular overlay pattern** is essential for core identity.
    Question: Is the triangular panel structure across the midfoot preserved in shape and spatial arrangement?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The "SPEEDCROSS" text with its multicolored stripe is a key branding element located along the lateral side of the shoe. Its position and font style are unique to this model. Even when converted to wood, the **text placement and direction** must remain consistent to ensure model recognition. Losing this would undermine brand identity.
    Question: Is the "SPEEDCROSS" text positioned along the lateral side of the shoe in the same location and orientation as in the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The Salomon logo on the heel counter and tongue tab is a primary brand identifier. Its placement is fixed and standardized across models. Altering its position or removing it would make the shoe unidentifiable as a Salomon product. Therefore, the **logo’s location and shape** must be preserved even in sculpted form.
    Question: Are the Salomon logos present on both the heel counter and tongue tab in their original positions?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The lacing system, including the number and alignment of eyelets, defines the shoe’s closure mechanism and contributes to its structural design. Changing the lacing path or eyelet count would distort the functional and visual integrity of the shoe. Thus, the **lacing layout and eyelet positions** must be preserved.
    Question: Is the lacing system maintained with the same number and spacing of eyelets as in the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The outsole features a specific lug pattern and the "contagrip" text, which are signature elements of Salomon trail shoes. The **shape and spacing of the lugs**, as well as the **location of the "contagrip" label**, are crucial for identifying the shoe’s purpose and brand. Any deviation would misrepresent the product.
    Question: Is the outsole lug pattern and the "contagrip" text preserved in their original positions and shapes?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The toe cap has a distinct reinforced shape with an embossed "S" logo, which is a functional and branding detail. Its form is critical for recognizing the front profile of the shoe. Even in wood, the **shape of the toe cap and the "S" logo** must be retained to preserve identity.
    Question: Is the reinforced toe cap shape and the embossed "S" logo preserved in the same location and form?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The "LT LIGHT WEIGHT MIDSOLE" label is a technical specification indicator placed near the heel. While smaller, it is a key detail that identifies the shoe’s construction type. Its **position and rectangular shape** must be preserved to maintain informational accuracy.
    Question: Is the "LT LIGHT WEIGHT MIDSOLE" label present in the same location and shape near the heel?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
