Description of reference image: The subject is a man standing upright on the fuselage of a large commercial airplane, positioned near the front section just behind the cockpit. He is wearing a black short-sleeved t-shirt, dark blue jeans, and dark shoes. His posture is straight, with arms relaxed at his sides, and he faces forward toward the camera. The airplane is white with a smooth, glossy surface, featuring two large jet engines mounted under the wings, a prominent nose cone, and a row of oval passenger windows along the fuselage. The aircraft has a high vertical stabilizer (tail fin) and swept-back wings with visible flaps and ailerons. The landing gear is deployed, showing multiple wheels beneath the fuselage and wings. The background consists of a partly cloudy sky with soft white cumulus clouds against a light blue backdrop, suggesting daytime outdoor lighting. The ground appears to be a flat, gray tarmac surface, indicating an airport environment.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed. The instruction specifies transforming the individual into a One Piece-themed anime-style collectible action figure, which means the human form, clothing style, facial features, and overall appearance of the person are allowed to change. It also states that the scene should be reimagined as a collectible box with isometric view and aviation-themed design elements, meaning the original environmental context (airplane, sky, tarmac) is not required to remain intact in its literal form. However, the instruction does **not** say to remove or alter the airplane itself; instead, it incorporates airplane elements (wings, propellers) into the packaging design. This implies that while the physical airplane may be stylized or abstracted, its core structural components must still be visually referenced. Additionally, the instruction requires the inclusion of a hyper-realistic depiction of the actual figure posed on an airplane wing — this suggests that the **airplane wing** remains a key functional and spatial element that must be preserved in some form for logical consistency. Therefore, changes are permitted to:
- The individual’s appearance (clothing, face, body proportions)
- The overall scene composition (background, lighting, perspective)
- The artistic style (anime vs. realistic)
But the following are **not explicitly allowed to change**, and thus must be retained based on their role in maintaining identity and logic:

Allowed Changes List:
- The individual's facial features, hairstyle, clothing, and pose
- The color and texture of the individual’s attire
- The overall scene layout and background (sky, clouds, tarmac)
- The artistic rendering style (realistic vs. anime)
- The position and orientation of the character relative to the plane (as long as it aligns with the new concept)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The airplane is the central object in the original image and serves as the primary anchor for the scene. Its distinctive shape — including the rounded nose, twin engines, oval passenger windows, and tail fin — is essential for identifying it as a commercial jet. These features are iconic and distinguishable from other aircraft types. Even though the airplane will be reimagined within a collectible box, the instruction includes airplane elements like wings and propellers in the design, implying that the **core structure of the airplane must be preserved in symbolic or structural form**. Thus, the fundamental silhouette and component layout of the airplane must remain recognizable.

Functional/logical association elements: The individual is standing on the fuselage of the airplane, which establishes a spatial relationship between the person and the aircraft. In the edited version, the character is placed atop a small airplane wing inside the box, and there is a separate hyper-realistic depiction of the figure standing on a wing. This indicates that the **airplane wing** is a critical functional element — it supports the character and maintains the narrative of "standing on an airplane." Therefore, the presence and basic form of the wing must be preserved in both the collectible display and the realistic depiction.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding the allowed changes (person’s appearance, background, artistic style), the remaining visual elements that define the original image are the airplane’s structural components. These include:
- The shape and placement of the engines
- The row of oval passenger windows
- The nose cone and cockpit windows
- The tail fin and wing structure
- The landing gear configuration
These are not mentioned as being altered in the instructions, and since they are integral to the identity of the airplane, they must be retained in some form, even if stylized.

Preservation Targets List:
- The presence and general shape of the airplane’s fuselage
- The twin-engine configuration under the wings
- The row of oval passenger windows along the side of the fuselage
- The nose cone and cockpit window arrangement
- The wing structure, particularly the main wing span and engine mounting
- The tail fin (vertical stabilizer)
- The landing gear with multiple wheels
- The airplane wing as a platform for the character (functional support)

Q1:  
Thinking process: The twin-engine configuration is a defining feature of this specific type of commercial aircraft (likely an Airbus A320 family). The engines are mounted under the wings and have a distinct circular intake with visible fan blades and nacelle shape. This is a core identification element because changing the number or placement of engines would make the aircraft unrecognizable as the same model. Since the instruction mentions incorporating airplane elements like wings and propellers into the box design, the engine placement must be preserved in symbolic form. Losing this feature would break the reference to the original aircraft.
Question: Are the two jet engines mounted under the wings of the airplane present and correctly positioned?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The row of oval passenger windows is a signature visual trait of commercial airliners and helps identify the aircraft type. Their consistent spacing and shape along the fuselage are crucial for recognition. The instruction does not mention removing or altering these windows, and since the airplane is being used as a design motif in the collectible box, the window pattern must be retained to maintain authenticity. Removing or distorting them would compromise the airplane’s identity.
Question: Is the continuous row of oval-shaped passenger windows visible along the side of the fuselage?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The nose cone and cockpit windows form a distinctive front profile of the aircraft. The rounded nose and three-part windshield (with two side windows and one central panel) are key identifiers. The instruction requires the airplane to be represented in the collectible design, so this frontal feature must be preserved to ensure the aircraft remains recognizable. Altering this would misrepresent the original aircraft.
Question: Is the rounded nose cone with the three-part cockpit window configuration present at the front of the airplane?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The vertical stabilizer (tail fin) is a critical structural element that defines the rear of the aircraft. Its height and shape are unique to this aircraft model. The instruction specifies incorporating airplane elements into the box design, which implies the tail must be included. Removing or altering it would disrupt the aircraft’s silhouette and make it unidentifiable.
Question: Is the tall vertical stabilizer (tail fin) present at the rear of the airplane?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The landing gear with multiple wheels is a functional and visual detail that confirms the aircraft is on the ground. The configuration — with dual wheels under the fuselage and wing-mounted gear — is characteristic of this aircraft type. While the instruction allows for scene transformation, the presence of landing gear supports the realism of the original image and must be preserved in the hyper-realistic depiction of the figure on the wing. Omitting it would break the logical connection to the real-world setting.
Question: Are the landing gear assemblies with multiple wheels visible beneath the fuselage and wings?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The wing structure, especially the main wing span and engine mounting points, is essential for the character’s positioning in both the collectible and realistic depictions. The instruction specifies placing the character on a wing, so the wing must retain its basic form and function. The wing’s shape and attachment to the fuselage are key to maintaining spatial logic. Altering this would undermine the narrative of the character standing on the airplane.
Question: Is the main wing structure extending from the fuselage with engines mounted underneath?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The cockpit windows are part of the front-facing profile and contribute to the aircraft’s identity. Their specific arrangement — two side windows and one central panel — is a minor but identifiable detail. While not as critical as the engines or fuselage, they help confirm the aircraft model and must be preserved for visual coherence.
Question: Are the three cockpit windows arranged in a horizontal line at the front of the airplane?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
