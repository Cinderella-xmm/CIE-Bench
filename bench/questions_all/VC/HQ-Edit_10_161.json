      "thinking_process": "The diamond-shaped pattern with spiral interiors on the dress is the defining cultural and artistic motif. It is the key identifier of the attire's African tribal inspiration. If this pattern is altered or replaced, the cultural essence and identity of the clothing are lost. The instruction explicitly states to preserve the original geometric patterns, making this a core element. Thus, the question directly checks whether the specific pattern remains intact.",
      "question": "Does the dress retain the exact geometric pattern of orange-brown diamonds with spiral centers on a turquoise blue background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The bead color sequence on the hair (red-white-yellow-black) is a distinctive cultural marker. The instruction specifies retaining the colorful hairstyle as a bas-relief, implying the colors must remain. Changing the sequence would alter the cultural symbolism. Since the beads are being reimagined as stained glass, their color must still match the original sequence to preserve identity. This is a core identification feature.",
      "question": "Are the beads on the hair arranged in the same repeating sequence of red, white, yellow, and black as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The crown-like upward coil of the braids is a structural hallmark of the hairstyle. The instruction allows transformation into bas-relief but requires retention of the cultural essence. The shape of the coils defines the hairstyle’s identity. If the coils are flattened or reshaped, the cultural form is compromised. This is a key structural feature.",
      "question": "Do the braids maintain their upward-coiled crown-like structure originating from the scalp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The layered beaded necklace is a prominent accessory. While its material may change to stained glass, its **layered structure** and **position around the neck** are critical. The number of layers and their concentric arrangement define the piece. Losing this would break the visual logic of the jewelry. It is a key accessory element.",
      "question": "Is the necklace composed of multiple horizontal layers of beads arranged in concentric rings around the neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The stacked bangles on both wrists are part of the cultural adornment. Their **presence**, **number**, and **color sequence** (white, red, yellow, green, black) are visually distinct. The instruction does not permit removal or relocation. Even if reimagined as stained glass, their stacking and position must remain. This affects visual balance and cultural accuracy.",
      "question": "Are there multiple stacked bangles present on both wrists, maintaining the original color sequence and positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The hoop earrings are a signature accessory. Their **circular shape** and **position in the earlobe** are essential. The instruction does not mention removing them, only reimagining materials. Their absence or misplacement would disrupt the subject’s appearance and cultural identity. This is a minor but identifiable detail.",
      "question": "Are the large circular hoop earrings present in the left earlobe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The facial expression and pose are crucial for emotional and identity continuity. The girl’s **smile**, **eye contact**, and **forward-facing posture** are core to the image’s warmth and character. The instruction does not suggest altering these. Any change would affect recognition of the subject.",
      "question": "Does the girl maintain a smiling expression with direct eye contact and a forward-facing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The dress’s **sleeveless cut** and **flared skirt** define its silhouette. Even if rendered as mosaic, the **shape and structure** must remain. Altering the cut (e.g., adding sleeves) would change the garment’s identity. This is a structural detail critical to the attire’s form.",
      "question": "Does the dress have a sleeveless top and a flared skirt section with vertical pleats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
