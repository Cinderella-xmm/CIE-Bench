**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is the Eiffel Tower, centrally positioned in the composition, standing tall against a bright blue sky with a radiant sun at the upper left. The tower's iconic lattice iron structure is fully visible, with its four arched legs forming a symmetrical base. Below it lies the Champ de Mars, featuring manicured green lawns, a long reflective pool aligned toward the tower, and pathways populated with small figures representing pedestrians. In the foreground, there are neatly trimmed spherical trees in autumnal hues of orange, yellow, and green. To the left, a distant spire resembling the Sacré-Cœur or another Parisian landmark rises above the cityscape. The background includes a hazy skyline of Parisian buildings, including modern high-rises and historic rooftops. The lighting suggests early morning or late afternoon, with warm sunlight casting long shadows and creating a golden glow across the scene.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies a transformation into a "shadow box diorama," which fundamentally changes the medium and presentation format. Key phrases include:  
- *"Transform the Eiffel Tower landscape into an intricate shadow box diorama"* → This implies a complete shift from a photograph-like realism to a layered paper art form.  
- *"Layer the skyline and foreground on multiple paper cut-outs for depth"* → Allows modification of layering and material representation of all elements.  
- *"Replace the lawn with a mirror-like surface"* → Directly modifies the texture and function of the grassy areas.  
- *"Add tiny 3D-printed pedestrians"* → Replaces real human figures with artificial models, allowing change in figure type and material.  
- *"Encase in a dark-framed shadow box with metallic edges"* → Adds a new container frame not present in original; this is a structural addition outside the original image.  
- *"Include detailed city names and coordinates engraved finely along the frame"* → Introduces new textual elements not in the original image.

These instructions clearly permit **transformation of materials, textures, layout depth, and framing**, but do **not explicitly state** that the **iconic form of the Eiffel Tower, its position relative to surrounding landmarks, or the overall spatial arrangement of key features (like the reflecting pool)** must be changed.

Thus, allowed changes include:
- Material of surfaces (e.g., lawn → mirror)
- Medium (photo → diorama)
- Representation style (realistic → papercut/3D-printed)
- Addition of frame and text
- Replacement of people with miniature models

However, the **core identity of the Eiffel Tower** — its shape, structure, and location — must remain recognizable even if stylized.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes)  
- The texture and material of the lawn (can be replaced with mirror-like surface)  
- The appearance and form of pedestrians (can be replaced with 3D-printed miniatures)  
- The rendering technique of the entire scene (can be transformed into layered paper cut-outs)  
- The inclusion of a dark-framed shadow box with metallic edges (new framing element)  
- The engraving of city names and coordinates on the frame (new textual content)  
- The visual depth and layering of skyline and foreground (can be restructured into paper layers)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
To preserve the **identity and recognizability** of the scene as a depiction of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, certain core visual features must be retained despite the artistic transformation.

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **Eiffel Tower’s unique lattice structure** is the most critical identifier. Its three-tiered design, curved arches, and tapering spire are unmistakable. Any alteration that distorts these forms would render it unrecognizable. Even in a diorama, the silhouette and architectural details must match.
- The **relative positioning** of the Eiffel Tower to the reflecting pool and surrounding parkland is essential for spatial coherence. The pool must still align directly toward the tower’s base, maintaining the axial symmetry seen in real-world views.
- The **presence of the reflecting pool** is a signature feature of the Trocadéro gardens view. While its surface can be made mirror-like, its **rectangular shape and alignment** must remain unchanged.
- The **Champ de Mars park layout**, including the symmetrical pathways and tree rows, defines the foreground space. These geometric patterns help establish the setting.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **axis between the pool and the tower** represents a real-world alignment. Changing this would break the logical spatial relationship and make the scene appear inaccurate.
- The **position of the sun** in the upper-left quadrant contributes to the lighting and mood. While the sun’s intensity may vary in the diorama, its **location relative to the tower** should remain consistent to maintain directional logic.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After excluding allowed changes (materials, figures, framing), the remaining visual components that must stay intact are:
- The **Eiffel Tower’s structural outline**
- The **shape and placement of the reflecting pool**
- The **symmetrical garden layout**
- The **distant Parisian skyline**, particularly the identifiable spire to the left
- The **overall composition balance**, especially the central placement of the tower

These elements ensure the viewer still recognizes the scene as the Eiffel Tower viewed from the Trocadéro Gardens.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
(Element 1 that should be maintained)  
- The distinctive latticed iron framework of the Eiffel Tower, including its four arched legs and tapered spire  
(Element 2 that should be maintained)  
- The rectangular reflecting pool aligned directly toward the base of the Eiffel Tower  
(Element 3 that should be maintained)  
- The symmetrical arrangement of pathways and rounded trees in the foreground park  
(Element 4 that should be maintained)  
- The presence of the distant spire-shaped building to the left of the Eiffel Tower  
(Element 5 that should be maintained)  
- The central positioning of the Eiffel Tower within the composition

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The latticed iron structure of the Eiffel Tower is its defining architectural feature. The specific pattern of crisscrossing beams, the four arched legs, and the tapering spire are universally recognized. If these are altered or simplified beyond recognition, the tower cannot be identified as the Eiffel Tower. This is a core identity element, making it a 3-point question.
    Question: Is the Eiffel Tower depicted with its characteristic lattice iron framework, including the four arched legs and tapered spire?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The reflecting pool is a key compositional and geographical feature of the view from the Trocadéro. Its rectangular shape and direct alignment toward the tower are essential for spatial accuracy. Even if made mirror-like, its form and orientation must remain identical. This is a crucial scene element that supports recognition of the location, hence a 2-point weight.
    Question: Is the rectangular reflecting pool positioned directly in front of the Eiffel Tower, aligned along the central axis of the composition?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The symmetrical layout of the park, including the straight pathways and evenly spaced spherical trees, defines the formal garden design of the Champ de Mars. This pattern is a signature of the site. Altering its geometry would disrupt the authentic representation of the location. It is a major environmental detail, so it receives a 2-point weight.
    Question: Are the pathways and tree arrangements in the foreground arranged symmetrically around the central axis leading to the Eiffel Tower?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The distant spire to the left (likely the Sacré-Cœur or another notable Parisian landmark) provides contextual grounding for the Parisian setting. Its presence helps anchor the scene geographically. While not the main subject, it is a key background feature that supports authenticity. Removing or altering it would misrepresent the skyline, so it is important enough for a 2-point weight.
    Question: Is there a distinct spire-shaped building visible in the distance to the left of the Eiffel Tower?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The sun's position in the upper-left quadrant creates a specific lighting direction and atmospheric effect. While its brightness may be adjusted in the diorama, its location relative to the tower affects shadows and perspective. Preserving this ensures consistency in the scene's orientation and time of day. It is a minor but coherent detail, thus assigned 1 point.
    Question: Is the sun located in the upper-left portion of the sky, casting light from that direction?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
