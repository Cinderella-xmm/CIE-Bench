Description of reference image: The subject is a Nike Zoom Freak 2 basketball sneaker, shown in profile view from the lateral side. The shoe features a predominantly light gray and white color scheme with a breathable mesh upper. A prominent white strap crosses the midfoot, secured by a Velcro fastener, with a small embossed Nike Swoosh logo visible on the strap. The laces are light gray, matching the overall tone of the upper. The heel counter is reinforced with a slightly darker gray material, and a pull tab is present at the back for ease of wear. The midsole is thick and layered, featuring a speckled texture with subtle white flecks throughout, and a large black Nike Swoosh logo is positioned on the lateral side of the midsole. The outsole is not fully visible but appears to be integrated into the midsole design. The background is plain white, with no additional elements or context, emphasizing the product's clean and modern aesthetic.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that explicitly state changes to be made:  
- "Replace the shoe upper with sleek, transparent materials revealing intricate circuitry patterns inside" → This allows full transformation of the **upper material**, including mesh, strap, and lacing system.  
- "Adjust the Swoosh logo to emit a cool neon blue glow" → This modifies the **color and luminosity** of the Swoosh, but does not remove it; thus, its **position and iconic shape** must remain.  
- "Attach a small digital screen on the strap displaying dynamic animations" → This adds new components to the **strap**, so the **original strap’s position and function** (as a Velcro fastener) can be altered in form but not necessarily location.  
- "Add a collapsible digital shoe box with holographic branding and a metallic finish..." → This introduces a **new scene element** (the shoe box), meaning the **background** can be changed.  

Therefore, the following are allowed to change:  
- Upper material (mesh replaced with transparent circuitry)  
- Strap surface (replaced with digital screen)  
- Swoosh color and glow effect (but not shape or position)  
- Background (introduction of digital shoe box)  
- Lacing system (can be modified or removed)  
- Midsole texture (speckles may be altered or replaced)  

Allowed Changes List:  
- Shoe upper material (mesh → transparent with circuitry)  
- Strap surface (Velcro → digital screen)  
- Swoosh color and lighting (black → neon blue glow)  
- Lacing system (can be removed or redesigned)  
- Background (white → includes digital shoe box)  
- Midsole texture (speckled pattern → may be replaced)  

Step 2– Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **Nike Swoosh logo** is a globally recognized brand identifier. Even if its color changes to neon blue, its **shape and position** (on the lateral midsole) must be preserved to maintain brand identity. Altering its shape or removing it entirely would break core recognition.  
- The **overall silhouette of the sneaker**, particularly the **midfoot strap**, **heel counter**, and **thick midsole**, defines the model as the Zoom Freak 2. While materials may change, the **structural outline** must remain consistent to preserve model identity.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **strap’s placement across the midfoot** serves both functional (support) and aesthetic purposes. Although it will be replaced with a digital screen, its **spatial position** (crossing the midfoot horizontally) must be retained to preserve logical continuity.  
- The **pull tab at the heel** is a functional design feature for ease of entry. Its **presence and location** should remain unless explicitly removed in instructions — but since it is not mentioned, it should be preserved.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
- The **lateral profile view** of the shoe is implied by the original image and is essential for consistent product presentation. Unless stated otherwise, the **angle and orientation** should remain unchanged.  
- The **presence of the shoe itself** as the central subject must be maintained; it cannot be replaced by another object.  
- The **general proportions** of the shoe (toe box width, heel height, midsole thickness) must stay consistent to avoid distorting the model’s identity.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The **Swoosh logo’s shape and lateral midsole position**  
- The **midfoot strap’s horizontal placement**  
- The **pull tab at the heel**  
- The **lateral profile view**  
- The **overall shoe silhouette** (including toe box, heel, and midsole volume)  
- The **presence of the shoe as the central subject**

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The Nike Swoosh logo is the most iconic visual element of the shoe and the primary brand identifier. Its **distinct curved shape** and **position on the lateral midsole** are critical for recognition. Even if the color changes to neon blue, the **outline and placement** must remain identical to ensure the shoe is still identifiable as a Nike product. Losing this would fundamentally alter the brand identity, making it unrecognizable. Therefore, this is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the Swoosh logo present in the same curved shape and located on the lateral side of the midsole?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The midfoot strap is a defining structural feature of the Zoom Freak 2, providing both support and visual contrast. Its **horizontal placement across the midfoot** is a key design element. Even though it will be transformed into a digital screen, its **spatial position** must remain unchanged to preserve the shoe’s architectural logic. If moved or reoriented, the shoe’s identity would be compromised. This is an important structural element affecting overall consistency, hence a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Is there a horizontal strap positioned across the midfoot area of the shoe?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The pull tab at the heel is a functional detail designed for ease of wear. It is a small but distinct feature visible in the original image. Since the instruction does not mention removing or relocating it, and it contributes to the shoe’s usability and design language, it must be retained. Its **presence at the top rear of the heel** is a minor but coherent detail. Removing it would reduce visual fidelity, though not affect core identity. Thus, it is a detail-level element with a weight of 1 point.
    Question: Is there a pull tab located at the top rear of the heel?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The lateral profile view is essential for maintaining visual consistency with the original product presentation. The shoe is shown in a side-on perspective, which allows clear visibility of the Swoosh, strap, and midsole. Changing the angle (e.g., front or angled view) would disrupt the reference relationship. Since the instruction does not specify a different angle, the **side profile must be preserved**. This is a key scene/positional element affecting overall coherence, hence a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Is the shoe shown in a lateral (side) profile view?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The overall silhouette of the shoe—defined by the **toe box shape**, **midsole thickness**, and **heel height**—is unique to the Zoom Freak 2 model. These proportions distinguish it from other sneakers. Even if materials are replaced with transparent tech elements, the **external volume and shape** must remain consistent to preserve model identity. Altering these would make it unrecognizable as the same shoe. This is a core structural feature, thus a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Does the shoe maintain the same overall silhouette, including the rounded toe box, thick midsole, and elevated heel?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The presence of the shoe as the central subject is fundamental. The instruction specifies transforming the sneaker into a gadget, not replacing it with another object. Therefore, the **shoe must remain the focal point** of the image. If another object (like a robot or device) replaces it, the edit fails. This is a core functional requirement, ensuring the subject remains consistent. Hence, a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the sneaker still the central and primary object in the image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
