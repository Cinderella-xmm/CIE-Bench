      "thinking_process": "The wide open mouth with clearly defined white teeth is a core identifying feature of the ceramic face. This exaggerated grin is central to the object's character and expression. If this feature is lost or altered significantly, the sculpture would no longer be recognizable as the original figure. Therefore, the presence and structure of the mouth and teeth are critical identity markers.",

      "thinking_process": "The black eyebrows are prominent and uniquely positioned above the eye sockets, contributing to the expressive nature of the face. Their shape and placement are essential for facial recognition. Removing or altering them would change the emotional tone and identity of the figure.",

      "thinking_process": "The dark, rounded ears are distinctive and symmetrically placed on either side of the head. They are part of the faceâ€™s iconic silhouette. Losing these would disrupt the balance and recognizability of the sculpture.",
      "question": "Are the dark, rounded ears present on both sides of the head?",

      "thinking_process": "The eye sockets are hollow and circular, serving as key structural features of the face. Their presence and placement are necessary for maintaining the facial symmetry and identity of the sculpture. Even if the surrounding material changes, these openings must remain.",
      "question": "Are there two circular eye sockets visible on the face?",

      "thinking_process": "The green-colored area on the top of the head is a unique visual marker, distinguishing it from other parts of the sculpture. While the instruction allows replacing it with a green puzzle fragment, the color and location must be preserved to maintain continuity with the original design.",
