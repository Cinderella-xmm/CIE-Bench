Description of reference image: The subject is a woman standing in the center of a bustling traditional Asian market, facing forward with a slight smile. She has shoulder-length black hair styled in soft waves, and her facial features are delicate with light makeup, including subtle pink lips and defined eyes. She wears a two-toned robe resembling a modernized hanbok or qipao hybrid—deep red on the right side and navy blue on the left—with a V-shaped collar and a wide red sash at the waist. The robe is adorned with intricate floral embroidery in gold and red tones along the seams, sleeves, and front panel, particularly featuring rose motifs and vine-like patterns. The fabric appears silky and reflective, with visible sheen and folds suggesting movement. The robe includes a high slit on the right leg, revealing part of her leg. The background consists of a covered market alley lined with stalls displaying fresh produce such as tomatoes, oranges, green vegetables, and other fruits. Red paper lanterns hang overhead in rows, glowing softly with warm yellow light, creating a festive atmosphere. Wooden beams support the roof structure, and various shoppers in casual clothing are seen browsing goods in the background, slightly blurred to emphasize depth. The ground is paved with stone tiles.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Create a decorative market-themed calendar" → implies a new layout/format (e.g., grid for months), but does not specify removal of original scene elements.  
- "Depict the woman in a semi-cartoon style" → allows transformation of art style; therefore, realism can be altered, including line work, proportions, shading, and texture rendering.  
- "Enhance her flowing robe with gold-embossed floral details" → explicitly modifies the robe’s design, meaning additional or intensified gold floral patterns are permitted. This indicates that existing floral patterns may be expanded upon, but their presence must still align with original motifs.  
- "Integrate red lanterns with luminous glow surrounding her silhouette" → adds glow effects around lanterns and possibly enhances their illumination, but the lanterns themselves remain present and identifiable.  
- "Use soft cream paper, with each month's grid designed around the robe's intricate floral patterns" → introduces a new canvas/background (cream paper) and overlay (calendar grids), but specifies that the floral patterns from the robe are used as design inspiration for the grids. This means the floral patterns must still be visually traceable and recognizable.  

Thus, the following are allowed changes:  
- Artistic style (semi-cartoon): acceptable transformation of rendering technique.  
- Enhancement of gold-embossed floral details: permissible amplification of existing floral designs.  
- Addition of luminous glow around lanterns: allowed enhancement of lighting effect.  
- Introduction of calendar grid and cream paper background: new structural layer, but must incorporate original floral patterns.  
- Modification of robe’s visual texture due to stylistic shift: acceptable within limits of preserving core design.

Allowed Changes List:  
(Semi-cartoon artistic style of the woman)  
(Enhancement of gold-embossed floral details on the robe)  
(Luminous glow added to red lanterns)  
(Introduction of cream paper background and calendar grid layout)  
(Stylization of lighting and shadows to suit cartoon aesthetic)

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The woman’s face, especially her facial structure, hairstyle, and expression, are central to identity. Even if stylized, key features like the shape of the eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline must remain consistent to preserve recognition.  
- The two-tone color scheme of the robe (red and navy blue) is distinctive and serves as a primary identifier of the outfit. Any change to this split must be avoided unless explicitly stated.  
- The floral embroidery pattern—specifically the rose and vine motif—is critical for identifying the robe’s design. While enhanced, it cannot be replaced with unrelated patterns.  
- The high slit on the right leg is a defining feature of the garment’s silhouette and must remain.  
- The presence and arrangement of red lanterns in the background are essential to the market theme and must be retained, even if glowing.  
- The market setting—stalls with colorful produce, stone pavement, wooden beams—forms the contextual backdrop and must be preserved in essence, though stylized.

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The woman stands in the center of the market aisle, which establishes spatial logic. Her position relative to the stalls and lanterns must be maintained to preserve environmental coherence.  
- The robe’s design is linked to the calendar’s grid via floral patterns—this cross-reference means the original floral motifs must be clearly extractable for use in the calendar design.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (style, glow, enhancements), the following must remain unchanged:  
- The woman’s facial features (shape, expression, hair length and style).  
- The red-and-blue color division of the robe.  
- The specific floral pattern (roses and vines) on the robe.  
- The high slit on the right leg.  
- The presence of red lanterns and their hanging arrangement.  
- The market stalls with visible produce (tomatoes, oranges, greens).  
- The stone pavement and wooden roof structure.  

Preservation Targets List:  
(The woman’s facial features: eye shape, nose, mouth, and hairstyle)  
(The two-tone color division of the robe: red on the right, navy blue on the left)  
(The floral embroidery pattern: roses and vines along the seams and front panel)  
(The high slit on the right leg of the robe)  
(The red lanterns hanging overhead in rows)  
(The market stalls with visible produce: tomatoes, oranges, green vegetables)  
(The stone pavement and wooden roof structure of the market)

Q1:  
Thinking process: The woman’s facial features—especially the shape of her eyes, nose, and mouth—are core identification markers. These define her distinct appearance and must remain intact even under semi-cartoon transformation. Loss of these would make her unrecognizable from the original. The hairstyle, being short and wavy, is also a key identifier. Therefore, this is a 3-point question.  
Question: Is the woman’s face clearly visible with the same eye shape, nose, mouth, and short wavy black hair as in the original image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The two-tone color division of the robe—red on the right and navy blue on the left—is a unique design feature that distinguishes this garment. Changing this would fundamentally alter the robe’s identity. It is a core visual element tied to the subject’s appearance. Thus, it is a 3-point question.  
Question: Does the robe maintain the red-on-right and navy-blue-on-left color division across the torso and sleeves?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q3:  
Thinking process: The floral embroidery, particularly the rose and vine pattern, is the most intricate and iconic detail of the robe. It is referenced in the instruction as a basis for the calendar’s design, making its retention essential. Even if enhanced, it must remain visually identifiable. This is a 3-point question.  
Question: Are the rose and vine floral patterns visible along the robe’s seams, front panel, and sleeves as in the original image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q4:  
Thinking process: The high slit on the right leg is a defining silhouette feature of the robe. Its absence would change the garment’s form significantly. It is a functional design choice and contributes to the overall aesthetic. It is an important detail, so it is a 2-point question.  
Question: Is there a high slit on the right leg of the robe, revealing part of the leg?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q5:  
Thinking process: The red lanterns are symbolic of the market setting and are specifically mentioned in the instruction. Their presence and arrangement (hanging in rows) establish the cultural and environmental context. Removing or altering them would break the scene’s authenticity. This is a 2-point question.  
Question: Are red paper lanterns visible hanging in rows above the market alley, glowing warmly?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q6:  
Thinking process: The market stalls with specific produce—tomatoes, oranges, green vegetables—are key environmental details that ground the scene. They provide visual variety and context. While stylized, they must remain recognizable. This is a 2-point question.  
Question: Are there visible stalls with tomatoes, oranges, and green vegetables arranged in crates along both sides of the alley?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q7:  
Thinking process: The stone pavement and wooden roof structure form the physical architecture of the market. They contribute to the scene’s realism and spatial logic. Though the style may shift, these structural elements must remain to preserve environmental coherence. This is a 1-point question.  
Question: Is the ground paved with stone tiles and the roof supported by wooden beams?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
