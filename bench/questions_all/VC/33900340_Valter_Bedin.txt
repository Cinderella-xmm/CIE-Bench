Description of reference image: The subject is a towering medieval stone structure, likely part of an ancient fortress or city gate, composed of large brick and stone masonry. It features a prominent central archway with vertical flanking pillars, forming a grand passage. Above the archway, there are crenellated battlements with alternating merlons and crenels, characteristic of defensive fortifications. To the right, additional arched openings and remnants of wall sections extend into the background, showing signs of weathering and partial ruin. On the left side, a long low wall runs parallel to the main structure, leading toward a distant figure walking away from the viewer, accompanied by a small dog. The ground is paved, and the scene is illuminated by strong directional light, casting deep shadows under the arches and along the walls. The sky is clear and gradient-toned, suggesting late afternoon or early morning lighting. The entire image is in black and white, emphasizing texture, contrast, and architectural form.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Convert the towering medieval structure into a colossal stone golem" → This explicitly changes the **form** and **identity** of the structure, indicating that its original architectural shape can be transformed into a humanoid figure.  
- "Using the archways as articulated limbs and battlements as a crown" → Specifies how structural elements (archways, battlements) are repurposed into new functional parts of a golem; thus, these components may change function and positioning but not necessarily their visual presence—only their interpretation.  
- "Imprint the surface with glowing ancient glyphs, replacing the wall texture" → Directly states that the **wall texture** must be replaced, meaning the original brickwork and stonework details are no longer required.  
- "Position the figure silhouetted against the sky, turning the original shadowed areas into a mystical aura" → Changes lighting and atmospheric effect; implies the original shadow patterns can be altered or replaced with ethereal glow.  
- "Transform the small figure into a luminous guide wisp, adding ethereal charm" → Explicitly replaces the human figure and dog with a non-physical, glowing entity; therefore, the human and animal forms are allowed to change entirely.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The overall form of the structure (from fortress to golem)  
- The function and arrangement of archways (as limbs)  
- The battlements (as crown)  
- Wall texture (replaced by glowing glyphs)  
- Lighting and shadow effects (transformed into mystical aura)  
- The small human figure and dog (transformed into a luminous wisp)  
- Sky background (can be enhanced with aura or glow)  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
Although the structure is being transformed into a golem, the instruction does **not** require removing or altering the fundamental **iconic architectural layout** such as the **central archway**, **vertical pillars**, and **crenellated battlements**—these are reinterpreted as limbs and crown, but their **original positions and relative spatial relationships** must logically persist for the transformation to make sense. Therefore, while the *meaning* of these elements changes, their **spatial configuration** must remain consistent with the original image. For example, the archway cannot be moved to the back if it was originally central.  
Additionally, the **paved ground plane** and **low wall on the left** define the spatial context and scale; altering them would disrupt the scene’s logic unless explicitly permitted. Since the instruction doesn’t mention changing the ground or side wall, they should be preserved.  
The **presence of the path leading toward the horizon** and the **relative position of the human figure near the end of the path** are important for spatial continuity. Even though the figure is changed, its **location** on the path remains relevant to the scene's composition.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **pathway between the low wall and the main structure** defines the walkway through which the figure moves. This linear flow must be retained to maintain narrative coherence.  
- The **relationship between the archway and the surrounding walls** must remain structurally plausible—i.e., the archway must still connect the two sides of the structure, even if stylized.  
- The **position of the human figure relative to the archway** (farther down the path, approaching it) must be preserved in terms of spatial hierarchy, even if the figure itself is transformed.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding all explicitly allowed changes (structure form, texture, lighting, figures), the remaining unmentioned elements include:  
- The **overall silhouette of the structure** (especially the height and verticality of the tower)  
- The **arrangement of the battlements** along the top edge  
- The **presence of multiple arches** (including secondary ones to the right)  
- The **texture of the ground** (though possibly enhanced, not removed)  
- The **angle of the perspective**, which emphasizes depth and leads the eye toward the archway  

These must be retained due to visual coherence and compositional integrity, even if some aspects are stylized.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The central archway’s position and orientation  
- The vertical alignment of the main tower and supporting pillars  
- The crenellated battlements along the top edge of the structure  
- The pathway leading from foreground to background  
- The low wall on the left side of the frame  
- The relative position of the human figure on the path  
- The presence of secondary arches to the right of the main structure  
- The general direction of light and shadow (though intensity may change)  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q1:  
Thinking process: The central archway is the most iconic and defining feature of the structure, serving as both a functional passage and a compositional anchor. Its location, size, and shape are critical to identifying the original architectural identity. Even when transformed into a limb, its position and basic form must remain consistent to preserve spatial logic. Removing or relocating it would fundamentally alter the structure’s identity and break the visual connection to the original image. This is a core identification feature, hence weight 3.  
Question: Is the central archway positioned at the center of the main structure, forming a passageway between the two vertical pillars?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The vertical pillars flanking the archway are essential to the structure’s symmetry and architectural balance. They define the height and stability of the tower and are directly referenced in the instruction as being used for articulation (limbs). Their presence and alignment must be preserved for the transformation to be coherent. Altering their position or removing one would destroy the structural integrity of the original design. This is a key architectural feature, so weight 2.  
Question: Are the two vertical pillars standing symmetrically on either side of the central archway, forming a tall, narrow gateway?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The crenellated battlements along the top of the structure are distinctive medieval defensive features. They contribute to the building’s identity and are explicitly mentioned in the instruction as becoming a crown. Their shape and placement must be preserved, even if stylized, because they are unique to this type of architecture. Losing them would make the structure unrecognizable as a fortress. This is a core visual identifier, hence weight 3.  
Question: Are the battlements along the top of the structure composed of repeating rectangular merlons and gaps (crenels)?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The low wall on the left side of the frame creates a sense of depth and enclosure, framing the pathway. It is a key environmental element that establishes the scene’s spatial context. Although the instruction does not mention it, it is integral to the composition and must remain to maintain logical consistency. Changing its position or removing it would disrupt the perspective and spatial relationship between the viewer and the main structure. This is an important scene element, so weight 2.  
Question: Is there a long, low brick wall running parallel to the main structure on the left side of the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The pathway leading from the foreground to the background is crucial for guiding the viewer’s eye and establishing scale. It connects the foreground figure to the archway and is essential for maintaining spatial coherence. Even if the figure is transformed, the path must remain intact to preserve the scene’s narrative flow. This is a functional element of the environment, so weight 2.  
Question: Is there a paved pathway extending from the foreground toward the central archway, running between the low wall and the main structure?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The secondary arches to the right of the main structure are part of the architectural complex and contribute to the historical authenticity of the site. They provide depth and complexity to the scene. While the instruction focuses on the central arch, these side arches are visible and distinct. Their presence helps confirm the original structure’s design. Removing them would simplify the scene unnaturally. This is a detail-level but important architectural feature, so weight 1.  
Question: Are there additional arched openings visible to the right of the main central archway, integrated into the same wall structure?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The relative position of the human figure on the path is critical for scale and narrative. Even though the figure will be transformed into a wisp, its location—walking away from the viewer toward the archway—must be preserved to maintain the scene’s spatial logic. This ensures continuity in the viewer’s perception of movement and distance. This is a logical positional element, so weight 2.  
Question: Is the small human figure located on the pathway, positioned behind the viewer and moving toward the central archway?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
