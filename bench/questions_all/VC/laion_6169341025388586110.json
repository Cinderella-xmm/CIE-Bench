      "thinking_process": "The trident (trishul) is the most iconic weapon associated with Lord Shiva. Its three-pronged shape and vertical orientation in the right hand are essential for identification. If it were removed or altered in form, the statue would no longer be recognized as Shiva. This is a core identity feature, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the trident with three prongs clearly visible and held vertically in the right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The damaru (drum) is a distinctive object held in Shiva's upper left hand, symbolizing the rhythm of creation. Its cylindrical shape and grip must remain intact for symbolic accuracy. Any alteration would compromise the deity's identity. This is a core functional element, thus 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the damaru (small drum) held in the upper left hand with a cylindrical shape and horizontal orientation?",
      "choices": [

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The golden serpent coiled around the neck and shoulder is a hallmark of Shiva, representing control over poison and destruction. Its presence, golden color, and winding path are critical identifiers. Removing or changing its form would misrepresent the deity. This is a core symbolic element, therefore 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the golden serpent visibly coiled around the neck and shoulder, with its head raised near the right shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The third eye on the forehead is a defining spiritual feature of Shiva, indicating omniscience. It is a fixed mark on the face and must remain present. Its absence would make the figure unrecognizable as Shiva. This is a core facial identifier, hence 3 points.",
      "question": "Is there a clearly visible third eye centered on the forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The crescent moon in the hair is a traditional adornment of Shiva, signifying his role as destroyer and controller of time. Its placement in the hairline is consistent across depictions. Losing it would diminish authenticity. This is a key accessory, so 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the crescent moon positioned in the hair above the forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The beaded mala around the neck is a standard accessory in Shiva’s iconography, often made of rudraksha seeds. Its presence reinforces the spiritual context. Though not as iconic as the trident, its absence would reduce visual fidelity. This is an important accessory, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Is a string of dark beads (mala) draped around the neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The abhaya mudra (hand gesture of protection) in the upper right hand is a ritualistic pose. Its precise finger positioning (index finger extended, others curled) is significant. Altering it would affect symbolic meaning. This is a key hand gesture, so 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the upper right hand raised with the index finger pointing upward and other fingers curled in abhaya mudra?",

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The golden bangles on the wrists are part of Shiva’s adornments, symbolizing divine power. Their presence enhances authenticity. While not central to identity, their omission would reduce visual consistency. This is a minor detail, so 1 point.",
      "question": "Are golden bangles visible on both wrists?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "thinking_process": "The seated posture with crossed legs (padmasana) is characteristic of meditative Shiva. Changing the leg position would alter the spiritual representation. Though the instruction allows shadowing, the pose itself must remain. This is a key postural element, so 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the statue seated in a cross-legged position with feet resting on the lap?",
      "choices": [

      "question_id": "Q10",
      "thinking_process": "The facial features—specifically the calm expression, half-closed eyes, and defined nose and lips—are essential for recognizing the deity’s serenity. These are subtle but crucial details. Loss would make the face generic. This is a facial detail, so 1 point.",
      "question": "Are the eyes half-closed, the lips slightly parted, and the expression serene?",
